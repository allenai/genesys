    "review": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the Proposal\n\n**1. Summary of the Proposal:**\nThe proposal introduces **DDLerpLinear-SC**, an enhanced variant of the existing **DDLerpLinear** unit within the RWKV6 architecture. The primary enhancements focus on integrating **semantic compression**, **selective state updates**, and **dynamic state expansion**. These modifications aim to improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently while optimizing parameter utilization and maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n**2. Strengths:**\n\n- **Innovative Integration:** The proposal uniquely combines semantic compression, selective state updates, and dynamic state expansion within a Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU). While individual components like semantic compression and selective updates have been explored, their integrated application within GAUs appears novel, potentially offering synergistic benefits that enhance overall model performance.\n\n- **Parameter Efficiency:** By employing semantic compression and selective updates, the design reduces redundant state information and focuses computational resources on semantically relevant aspects of the input. This leads to more efficient parameter utilization without compromising expressiveness.\n\n- **Enhanced Expressivity:** Dynamic state expansion allows the model to adaptively adjust its state representations based on the complexity of the input. This flexibility can improve the model's ability to capture and retain essential information over longer sequences, addressing one of the key challenges in autoregressive models.\n\n- **Aligned with Current Research Trends:** The proposal aligns with recent advancements in state space models and efficient language modeling techniques, drawing inspiration from works like **DenseMamba** and **Skip RNNs**. This ensures that the design is grounded in contemporary research and leverages established methodologies.\n\n- **Potential Impact on Multiple Metrics:**\n  - **Accuracy:** Enhanced state management is likely to improve the model's ability to retain and utilize relevant information over longer sequences, leading to better performance on tasks requiring understanding of long-term dependencies.\n  - **Robustness:** Adaptive state representations can make the model more resilient to noisy or irrelevant inputs by focusing computational resources on semantically significant information.\n  - **Efficiency:** Semantic compression and selective updates are expected to reduce computational and memory overhead, leading to faster inference times and lower operational costs.\n  - **Scalability:** The dynamic nature of state expansion suggests that DDLerpLinear-SC can scale more effectively with increasing data sizes and model complexities.\n\n**3. Concerns:**\n\n- **Increased Architectural Complexity:** Introducing multiple new components (SCM, SUG, DSE) increases the architectural complexity of the GAU. This may pose challenges in terms of implementation, debugging, and maintenance.\n\n- **Additional Parameters:** While the proposal emphasizes parameter efficiency, the integration of new modules like SCM and SUG introduces additional parameters. Although mitigated by semantic compression, careful balancing is required to ensure that the overall parameter count remains manageable.\n\n- **Training Complexity:** The enhanced design may require more sophisticated training strategies, including careful initialization and potentially longer training times to effectively learn the interactions between the new modules.\n\n- **Empirical Validation Needed:** The proposal is theoretically sound, but empirical results are necessary to validate the anticipated benefits. Without such validation, the practical impact remains uncertain.\n\n**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n- **Provide Detailed Implementation Guidelines:** While the high-level design is well-articulated, providing more detailed implementation guidelines, including initialization strategies and training procedures, would aid in practical adoption and replication.\n\n- **Empirical Validation Plans:** Outlining a plan for empirical validation, including specific benchmarks and tasks to evaluate the enhanced GAU's performance, would strengthen the proposal. Initial experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the integrated modules would provide compelling evidence of their benefits.\n\n- **Address Potential Overheads:** Discussing strategies to mitigate the additional computational and memory overhead introduced by the new modules would provide a more balanced view of the trade-offs involved.\n\n- **Modular Testing:** Proposing a modular testing approach, where each new component (SCM, SUG, DSE) is evaluated independently before integration, would help in isolating and addressing potential issues during development.\n\n**5. Final Rating:**\n```rating 4.0```\n\n**Rationale for Rating:**\nThe proposal for **DDLerpLinear-SC** is well-conceived, demonstrating a clear understanding of the challenges in autoregressive language modeling and offering innovative solutions by integrating semantic compression, selective state updates, and dynamic state expansion. The design aligns with current research trends and addresses multiple key metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. However, the increased architectural complexity and the need for empirical validation slightly temper the overall assessment. With comprehensive implementation guidelines and empirical support, the proposal has the potential to make significant contributions to the field.",

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/63 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFurther experimental details are in Appendix D. 1 . We show our Mamba results, together with Transformer results reported by Bhattamishra et al. [6], in Figure 3 , LSTMs perform perfectly on all languages, and are thus not shown. In a striking confirmation of Theorem 4 , Mamba learns all star-free languages with strong length generalization, and does poorly on all non-star-free languages. Transformers show somewhat more mixed performance, and do not always length-generalize even on the star-free languages. In agreement with Theorem 5 , Mamba, similar to Transformers, learns the counter languages, though it struggles with length generalization when compared to transformers. The differences in Mamba's performance between star-free and counter languages may stem from the fact that\n\n[^2]the construction for the former class (Theorem 4) is able to use finite precision and bounded state values at arbitrary input lengths, while the latter (Theorem5) uses unbounded state values. Bounded Hierarchical Structure To test Theorem 6, we recreate the experimental setup from Yao et al. [74]. Matching their Figure 4, we trained Mamba to predictively model $D y c k_{K, h}$ at $K=8$ and $h=10$. The training and the validation set contained samples of length $\\leq 700$, while the test set contained samples of length $700 \\leq n \\leq 1400$. Yao et al. [74] found both transformers and LSTMs achieved strong performance on this setup. We provide further details in Appendix D.3. Recall that Theorem 6 shows that two-layer SSMs can predictively model $D y c k_{K, h}$. We trained Mamba with 1 or 2 layers and varying dimensionality, finding that two layers can achieve essentially perfect performance across model sizes, even on the test set (Figure 4 and 57. ## 5 Discussion\n\nRelated Work Our work belongs to an incipient line of research into the expressiveness of SSMs [33, 49]. It is closely related to a long string of work studying the expressive capacity of neural sequence models, which has so far focused on recurrent networks [e.g. 62, 6, 28] and, more recently, self attention [e.g. 10, 48, 66]. A second link is to the classical and long-standing study of linear dynamical systems and control theory [34]. For instance, Theorem 2 relies the asymptotic convergence of an SSM on certain inputs, establishing a link to the asymptotics of linear systems [e.g. 55]. Take-Aways While theoretical in nature, our results have several actionable implications for SSM and LLM research, informing the rapidly growing research on SSM-based LLMs. First, encouragingly, SSMs can keep track of bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without explicitly implementing a stack (Theorem 6), suggesting that simple diagonal linear state updates may be sufficiently powerful for modeling the hierarchical structure of language. Second, SSMs resolve a basic failure mode of self-attention in flip-flop state tracking while being parallellizable (Theorem 1). Overall, SSMs and attention have overlapping but distinct strengths. This lends support to the development of hybrid architectures interleaving SSM and attention layers, as instantiated very recently by Jamba [42]. Third, nonnegative gates as obtained by exponential or sigmoid parameterizations provably restrict expressive capacity, even in non-time-invariant SSMs (Theorem 2). While [23] found no evidence that complex-valued paramerizations improved over real-valued ones in the language modality, our results suggest revisiting this question, at least for tasks where periodic state-tracking abilities may be important. Fourth, while exactly characterizing the capacity of transformers has proven difficult even in the finite-state case, Theorem 4 provides a decidable characterization of the regular languages - equivalently, finite-state tracking problems - that SSMs such as Mamba can model. Such decidable characterizations may make it easier to theoretically predict abilities and anticipate failures of LLMs; exploring the implications of this characterization in more realistic setups is an exciting direction for future research. Limitations The main limitation of our theoretical results is that they focus on in-principle expressiveness, and do not directly make statements about learning and generalization. Future work could address this, for example, by examining whether our constructions result in reasonably flat minima, or by studying gradient flow dynamics. While we empirically verified that our positive results can indeed be instantiated, in a learnable manner, in one realistic SSM implementation, implementational differences might still result in practical differences between implementations. Studying the role of such implementational differences is an interesting problem for future work; we have made a first step by theoretically elucidating the implications of nonnegative gate values. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have studied the expressive capacity of modern state space models (SSMs), through the lens of automata and formal languages. We have shown theoretically that SSMs can express star-free languages, a range of counter languages, and bounded hierarchical structure. By providing rigorous results about the expressiveness of the SSM architecture, our results can provide guidance to work on SSM-based language models. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Mark Rofin for useful discussion about Theorem 2\n\n## References\n\n[1] E.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) are the workhorse of modern sequence modeling, achieving remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, but they have unavoidable inefficiencies. Specifically, they require $\\Omega(L)$ memory $^{1}$ and\n\n[^0]compute to predict the next token of a sequence of length $L$. This has spurred a boom in attempts to create architectures that can achieve similar performance as transformers, but with $O(1)$ memory to predict each token. This class of models includes state space models like S4 (Gu et al., 2021) or Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), as well as traditional RNN models (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and models that can be trained in parallel like linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020) and parallel RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). In this paper, we will refer to this entire class of models that use a fixed-size memory as \"generalized state space models\" or GSSMs (see a formal definition in Section 2). Recent work has demonstrated impressive performance of GSSMs, but it is not yet clear what these models sacrifice for their improved efficiency, if anything. In this paper, we find that one particular capability that is sacrificed is the ability to retrieve and repeat parts of the input context. As a result, transformers are better than GSSMs at a variety of tasks that require accessing arbitrary parts of the context. To understand this gap in capabilities, we begin by presenting a theoretical analysis of the copying task ${ }^{2}$. First, we show via construction that a simple transformer model can copy strings of length that is exponential in the number of heads of the transformer. This construction relies on the ability of the transformer to implement a mechanism of \"storage\" and retrieval of sequences of $n$ tokens (n-grams), where the n-grams are used to track where to copy from. In contrast, we show that, trivially, GSSMs cannot accurately copy strings with more bits than the size of the latent state. Our theory studies representation expressivity, but not whether these representations will be learned. Moreover, in practice a large GSSM may have enough capacity to represent the entire input in the latent state, at least in theory. To resolve these concerns, we conduct a variety of synthetic experiments with models of $\\sim 160 \\mathrm{M}$ parameters. We find\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_493331fe8477e808e9a4g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1736&top_left_y=228&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. (a) Copying: training efficiency. Here we train models to copy strings of length $\\leq 300$ and evaluate string-level accuracy on strings of length 300. Transformers train much faster than GSSMs. An LSTM cannot even learn the task within this number of samples. (b) Copying: length generalization. Here we train models to copy on strings of length $\\leq 50$ until all models are perfect in-distribution and evaluate string-level accuracy. Purple dotted line indicates maximum training string length and green dotted line indicates context window during training. Evaluating on longer inputs, the transformer models dramatically outperform the GSSMs. Using our Hard-Alibi positional encoding, we can even generalize well beyond the training context size. (c) Lookup with pretrained models. Here the task requires looking up and retrieving a number from a \"phone book\" of varying length that is entirely in context. We evaluate pretrained models 1 -shot without any finetuning. Pythia (a transformer model) substantially outperforms Mamba (a GSSM) across model sizes. that transformers are both much more efficient at learning to copy (Figure 1a) and also generalize better to longer inputs (Figure 1b). Additionally, we verify experimentally that the copy \"algorithm\" learned by transformers indeed relies on ngrams to perform a lookup of where to copy from (Figure 3), similarly to our theoretical construction. Finally, we present a variety of experiments on pre-trained models to test their ability to remember and access the input context. In particular, we show that Pythia transformers (Biderman et al., 2023) outperform Mamba GSSMs (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) of similar size at a variety of memory-intensive tasks including copying and retrieving information from the context (Figure 1c). This is especially notable since the Mamba models achieve lower perplexity than the Pythia models at language modeling on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020). These experiments illustrate the practical relevance of the memory issues that we raise, and hint at one way that architectual choices can impact the downstream performance of LLMs above and beyond training perplexity. ## 2. Theory: Representational Capacity\n\nIn this section we use the copy task for a theoretical comparison between state space models and transformers. We prove two main results. First, we construct a small transformer that solves the copy task for sequences lengths that are exponential in the transformer size. Second, we show that any state space model fails to solve the copy task, unless its latent state grows linearly with the sequence length.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(2024); Grazzi et al. (2024); Park et al. (2024) studied the difference between Transformers and Mamba at in-context learning, which can be seen as a form of copying. In particular, Aky\u00fcrek et al. (2024) finds that Transformers have an advantage over other architectures at this task because they have \" $n$-gram heads\". Similarly to these works, we hint the limitations of SSMs\nin memory-intensive tasks such as copying because of their limited state size. We also show that Transformers can perform copying using the Hard-ALiBi positional encoding, which improves the model's ability to learn $n$-gram matching. ## 6. Discussion\n\nWe have demonstrated through theory and experiments that transformers are better than GSSMs at copying from their input context. However, we emphasize that state space models have many advantages over transformers. The memory and computational complexity of GSSMs does not increase with the input length, which is ideal for training and inference on long inputs. Additionally, state space models such as RNNs are better at tracking state variables across long sequences (Liu et al., 2023a), which may be useful for generating long consistent text. Importantly, language processing in the human brain appears to be much more similar to how state space models process language (Tikochinski et al., 2024). We therefore believe that future work should focus on building hybrid architectures that endow state space models with an attention-like mechanism, allowing them to retrieve relevant pieces of text from their input. Indeed, humans have an incredibly limited capacity for memorizing sequences (Miller, 1956), but can translate entire novels if we allow them to look back at the text (Shelton, 1612).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models language modeling\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language modeling*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Armin W. Thomas, Khaled K. Saab, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language modeling*\n\n*Behnam Neyshabur, Ashok Cutkosky, Ankit Gupta, Harsh Mehta*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models have shown to be effective at modeling long range dependencies, specially on sequence classification tasks. In this work we focus on autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and ArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using state space models (SSMs) and comparing them to transformers, here are some key points and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Handling Hierarchical Structure and Long-Range Dependencies\n\n### State Space Models (SSMs)\n- SSMs are particularly effective in modeling hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies due to their ability to capture complex dependencies within sequential data. They achieve this through a state-space representation that acts as a memory for the entire sequence, allowing them to handle long-range dependencies efficiently.\n- SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure efficiently, which is beneficial for tasks that require understanding nuanced meanings and context.\n- The use of linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length makes SSMs scalable and efficient for handling long sequences, a significant advantage over traditional transformer architectures which suffer from quadratic computational complexity.\n\n### Comparison with Transformers\n- Transformers excel at capturing complex word dependencies using the self-attention mechanism but face challenges with long-context sequences due to high computational and memory costs. In contrast, SSMs offer constant memory usage during inference and can be trained in parallel, reducing training time and improving efficiency.\n- While transformers are highly effective in tasks requiring precise in-context retrieval and complex long-range dependencies, SSMs can outperform them in certain areas like state tracking due to their Markovian nature. However, SSMs may fall short in scenarios requiring in-context retrieval or handling complex long-range dependencies without additional mechanisms.\n\n## Enhancing State Space Models for Language Modeling\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- To address the limitations of SSMs in handling complex long-range dependencies, hybrid architectures like Taipan have been proposed. Taipan combines the efficiency of SSMs (e.g., Mamba) with strategically placed Selective Attention Layers (SALs), optimizing resource allocation and enabling high performance while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### Optimizing Recurrence and Attention Mechanisms\n- Enhancing the recurrence mechanism in SSMs, such as using an S4-based data-dependent selection technique in Mamba, can improve the model's ability to capture long-term context efficiently. This approach filters specific inputs and achieves linear time efficiency in modeling long sequences.\n- Integrating local self-attention mechanisms into SSMs can allow them to perform in-context learning similarly to transformers, enhancing their ability to handle hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- SSMs can be computed efficiently and achieve linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length, making them suitable for real-time processing and analysis of sequential data. This scalability is crucial for large-scale language modeling tasks.\n\n## Future Directions and Innovations\n\n### State Compression Techniques\n- Investigating recent advances in state compression techniques could help in optimizing the memory usage and computational efficiency of SSMs, allowing them to handle even longer sequences effectively[Initial Analysis Note].\n\n### Attention Mechanism Optimization\n- Optimizing the attention mechanism, such as using selective attention layers, can help in balancing the computational resources and improving the model's performance in tasks requiring in-context retrieval and complex long-range dependencies.\n\n### Improving Long-Range Dependency Handling\n- Methods such as block-level recurrence and parallel computation within blocks can enhance the model's ability to maintain long-range dependencies while improving hardware utilization and efficiency[Initial Analysis Note].\n\nBy leveraging these insights, researchers can design more efficient and effective autoregressive language models that combine the strengths of SSMs and transformers, addressing the limitations of current architectures and improving overall performance.\n",

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2.

This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models serve as the backbone for a wide range of tasks across Artificial Intelligence due to their ability to learn complex interactions in large datasets [Bommasani et al., 2021]. In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 3. LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021).

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid state space models attention mechanism\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 268  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

TransBTSV2: Towards Better and More Efficient Volumetric Segmentation of Medical Images\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Jing Wang, Hong Yu, Sen Zha, Tianxiang Zhang, Chen Chen, Wenxuan Wang, Jiangyun Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer, benefiting from global (long-range) information modeling using self-attention mechanism, has been successful in natural language processing and computer vision recently. Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of capturing local features, are difficult to model explicit long-distance dependencies from global feature space. However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we present the further attempt to exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for 3D medical image volumetric segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTSV2 based on the encoder-decoder structure. Different from TransBTS, the proposed TransBTSV2 is not limited to brain tumor segmentation (BTS) but focuses on general medical image segmentation, providing a stronger and more efficient 3D baseline for volumetric segmentation of medical images. As a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, TransBTSV2 can achieve accurate segmentation of medical images without any pre-training, possessing the strong inductive bias as CNNs and powerful global context modeling ability as Transformer. With the proposed insight to redesign the internal structure of Transformer block and the introduced Deformable Bottleneck Module to capture shape-aware local details, a highly efficient architecture is achieved with superior performance. Extensive experimental results on four medical image datasets (BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, LiTS 2017 and KiTS 2019) demonstrate that TransBTSV2 achieves comparable or better results compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumor, liver tumor as well as kidney tumor.

MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models attention mechanism*\n\n*Zhenzhang Li, Yubiao Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the era of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been extensively studied and widely used in medical image classification tasks. Unfortunately, CNN's limitations in modeling long-range dependencies result in poor classification performances. In contrast, ViTs are hampered by the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism, making them difficult to deploy in real-world settings with limited computational resources. Recent studies have shown that state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by it, we proposed MedMamba, the first Vision Mamba for generalized medical image classification. Concretely, we introduced a novel hybrid basic block named SS-Conv-SSM, which purely integrates the convolutional layers for extracting local features with the abilities of SSM to capture long-range dependencies, aiming to model medical images from different image modalities efficiently. By employing the grouped convolution strategy and channel-shuffle operation, MedMamba successfully provides fewer model parameters and a lower computational burden for efficient applications without sacrificing accuracy. We thoroughly evaluated MedMamba using 16 datasets containing ten imaging modalities and 411,007 images. Experimental results show that MedMamba demonstrates competitive performance on most tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This work aims to explore the potential of Vision Mamba and establish a new baseline for medical image classification, thereby providing valuable insights for developing more powerful Mamba-based artificial intelligence algorithms and applications in medicine.

This model combines the efficiency of SSMs with the expressive power of attention mechanisms. Mamba-2 uses a selective data-dependent mechanism and a recurrent form that can be equivalently expressed as a matrix multiplication, encoding temporal dependencies and content-based interactions similar to attention. This approach balances computational efficiency and recall accuracy, particularly in memory-intensive tasks.\n\n### State Space Duality and Attention\nThe work by Dao and Gu (2024) highlights the connection between SSMs and Transformers through structured state space duality (SSD). This framework shows that SSMs can be generalized to include attention-like computations, maintaining the linear complexity advantage of SSMs while incorporating the expressive power of attention mechanisms. This duality allows for efficient algorithms that leverage the strengths of both architectures.\n\n## Efficient State Representation and Compression\n\n### Selective Attention and Sliding Window Attention\nThe Taipan architecture, mentioned in the same arXiv paper, combines selective attention and sliding window attention to enhance computational efficiency. This approach results in a sparser attention weight map, allowing for longer sliding windows to capture longer-range dependencies efficiently. This method helps in balancing the efficient processing of long sequences with the ability to capture important long-range dependencies.\n\n## Incorporating Selective Attention Without Losing Linear Complexity\n\n### Linear Attention and Its Generalizations\nLinear attention mechanisms, while efficient, lack the nonlinear normalization of softmax attention, which can impair the model's ability to focus sharply on specific tokens. However, generalizations like Mamba-2 address this limitation by using a structured state-space model that maintains linear complexity while providing attention-like capabilities. This approach ensures that the model can focus on relevant tokens without losing efficiency.\n\n## Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Hybrid Attention Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion Network (HASTF)\nAlthough primarily focused on EEG-based emotion recognition, the HASTF model provides insights into hybrid attention mechanisms. It combines spatial and temporal attention to fuse spatio-temporal features effectively. This approach can be adapted to language models by integrating multiple attention mechanisms to capture different aspects of the input sequence, such as local and global dependencies.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Furthermore, the proposed semantic compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while reducing the associated computational overhead. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe recent successful release of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (Radford et al., 2019) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) has sparked significant research efforts from both industry and academia. These LLMs have demonstrated the ability to engage in fluent and coherent conversations with human users, and have shown exceptional performance across various tasks, including document summarization, question-answering, dialogue bots, and code generation copilots. One critical issue faced by state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs is the restriction on the length of text that can be inputted into the model at once. When the input context exceeds the limit of the context window, the performance of these models rapidly declines. This limitation poses a challenge when it comes to handling long texts such as scientific papers, novels, and legal contracts with current LLMs. As a result, there has been a growing interest in finding ways to extend the input length without significantly compromising the model's performance. The limitation on the context window primarily stems from the quadratic computation of the selfattention mechanism in the transformer. Handling lengthy texts significantly increases the computational costs in terms of memory and time. Typically, models are trained on short contexts, and the maximum sequence length (i.e., the context window) is determined. If the models are compelled to generate contexts that exceed the context window, they tend to compromise the quality of the output due to the lack of position encoding information during the training process. Furthermore, generating long sequences imposes substantial memory requirements on the computational device. This accumulation of memory requirements and the lack of effective position encoding can result in length generalization failure (Anil et al., 2022), where the models struggle to generate meaningful and coherent text beyond a certain context window size. Some approaches have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges. One approach is to devise architectures with nearly linear complexity, which enables efficient scaling to handle\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-02.jpg?height=139&width=919&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=603)\n\nFigure 1: With the inclusion of the semantic compression module, the redundancies in the input are eliminated, thereby effectively extending the context window. The semantic compression is reminiscent of the concept of source coding in information theory. very long sequences. However, training a large model from scratch incurs substantial cost. Another strategy involves employing interpolation and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the position encoding to unseen sequence lengths. While this method has the potential to compromise the overall performance of LLMs, it still demands significant time and GPU resources for fine-tuning and inference on long sequences. Therefore, it is more efficient and resource-friendly to design methods that do not necessitate altering the parameters of the pre-trained model. While most previous algorithms relied on modifying the pre-trained model, we instead exploit the statistical properties of input natural language. One empirical phenomenon, known as Zipf's law (Zipf, 2016), observes that a small set of the most frequent word tokens in a large corpus of natural language account for almost all occurrences.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/21 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n# EXTENDING CONTEXT WINDOW OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS VIA SEMANTIC COMPRESSION \n\nWeizhi Fei ${ }^{\\dagger}$ \\& Xueyan Niu ${ }^{* \\ddagger}$<br>${ }^{\\dagger}$ Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China<br>$\\ddagger$ Theory Lab, 2012 Labs, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\n```\n\n#### 3. Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg. Score: 0.39)\n\n*Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) call for extension of context to handle many critical applications. However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/40 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\n# Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts \n\nAlexis Chevalier* Alexander Wettig* Anirudh Ajith Danqi Chen<br>Department of Computer Science \\& Princeton Language and Intelligence<br>Princeton University<br>\\{achevalier, anirudh.ajith\\}@princeton.edu<br>\\{awettig, danqic\\}@cs.princeton.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state compression selective computation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression selective computation*\n\n*Yusuke Tsuzuku, H. Imachi, Takuya Akiba*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated and an efficient algorithm to compute the variance with negligible additional cost is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers. However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

However, running retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) is slow and difficult to scale due to processing large amounts of retrieved text. We introduce binary token representations (BTR), which use 1-bit vectors to precompute every token in passages, significantly reducing computation during inference. Despite the potential loss of accuracy, our new calibration techniques and training objectives restore performance. Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia. Our experiments show that on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, BTR accelerates state-of-the-art inference by up to 4x and reduces storage by over 100x while maintaining over 95% task performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression selective computation*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, and performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has pushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to address high computational requirements and limited input sequence length. Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%.

Mini-Monkey: Multi-Scale Adaptive Cropping for Multimodal Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression selective computation*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Lianwen Jin, Dingkang Liang, Yuliang Liu, Mingxin Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, there has been significant interest in enhancing the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. Most existing methods focus on adopting a cropping strategy to improve the ability of multimodal large language models to understand image details. However, this cropping operation inevitably causes the segmentation of objects and connected areas, which impairs the MLLM's ability to recognize small or irregularly shaped objects or text. This issue is particularly evident in lightweight MLLMs. Addressing this issue, we propose Mini-Monkey, a lightweight MLLM that incorporates a plug-and-play method called multi-scale adaptive crop strategy (MSAC). Mini-Monkey adaptively generates multi-scale representations, allowing it to select non-segmented objects from various scales. To mitigate the computational overhead introduced by MSAC, we propose a Scale Compression Mechanism (SCM), which effectively compresses image tokens. Mini-Monkey achieves state-of-the-art performance among 2B-parameter MLLMs. It not only demonstrates leading performance on a variety of general multimodal understanding tasks but also shows consistent improvements in document understanding capabilities. On the OCRBench, Mini-Monkey achieves a score of 802, outperforming 8B-parameter state-of-the-art model InternVL2-8B.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression selective computation*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hybrid Binary Networks: Optimizing for Accuracy, Efficiency and Memory\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression selective computation*\n\n*Rohit Gajawada, Vishal Batchu, Anoop Namboodiri, Ameya Prabhu, Sri Aurobindo Munagala*\n\n**Abstract:** Binarization is an extreme network compression approach that provides large\ncomputational speedups along with energy and memory savings, albeit at\nsignificant accuracy costs. We investigate the question of where to binarize\ninputs at layer-level granularity and show that selectively binarizing the\ninputs to specific layers in the network could lead to significant improvements\nin accuracy while preserving most of the advantages of binarization. We analyze\nthe binarization tradeoff using a metric that jointly models the input\nbinarization-error and computational cost and introduce an efficient algorithm\nto select layers whose inputs are to be binarized. Practical guidelines based\non insights obtained from applying the algorithm to a variety of models are\ndiscussed. Experiments on Imagenet dataset using AlexNet and ResNet-18 models\nshow 3-4% improvements in accuracy over fully binarized networks with minimal\nimpact on compression and computational speed. The improvements are even more\nsubstantial on sketch datasets like TU-Berlin, where we match state-of-the-art\naccuracy as well, getting over 8% increase in accuracies. We further show that\nour approach can be applied in tandem with other forms of compression that deal\nwith individual layers or overall model compression (e.g., SqueezeNets). Unlike\nprevious quantization approaches, we are able to binarize the weights in the\nlast layers of a network, which often have a large number of parameters,\nresulting in significant improvement in accuracy over fully binarized models.\n\n**Published:** 2018-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on efficient state compression and selective computation, several techniques and approaches can be considered based on the provided sources and analysis notes.\n\n## Efficient State Compression\n\n### Selective State Space Models\nThe use of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) is a promising direction. Models like Mamba2 and Cheems integrate SSMs with attention mechanisms to achieve efficient state compression. For instance:\n- Mamba2 uses a selective state update algorithm, which balances quadratic and linear calculation methods and maintains a constant state size during generation, reducing computational complexity.\n- Cheems combines SSMs with quadratic self-attention algorithms, using SSD as an internal function to selectively update context information, which enhances efficiency and expressivity.\n\n### Quantization and Compression\nQuantization and compression techniques can significantly reduce the memory footprint and computational complexity:\n- Techniques like W4A8 and 4-bit KV-cache quantization, as well as progressive quantization of weights, can be applied to reduce the precision of model weights without significant loss in performance.\n- SmoothQuant and AWQ (Adaptive Weight Quantization) methods, developed by Song Han's lab, enable efficient quantization for large language models, maintaining performance while reducing memory usage.\n\n### Sparse Tensors and Matrices\nUsing sparse tensors and matrices can efficiently compress data by representing only non-zero elements:\n- Sparse sequence-to-sequence models, such as the Sparse Transformer, reduce complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n\\sqrt{n})\\) by applying sparse factorizations to self-attention matrices.\n- Techniques like COO, CSR, CSC, and LIL formats for storing sparse matrices can save memory and computational resources.\n\n## Selective Computation\n\n### Mixed Experts and Sparse Activation\nImplementing mixed experts with sparse activation can reduce training and inference costs:\n- The Cheems architecture uses a cross-domain mixture of experts with reduced parameter redundancy, which enhances efficiency and effectiveness.\n- Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) in models like SeqBoat sparsely activates Gated Attention Units based on state representations learned from SSMs, achieving linear inference complexity[Analysis Note #3].\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Adjustment\nDynamic parameter adjustment based on input content can improve efficiency:\n- Models like Mamba adjust SSM parameters based on input addresses, addressing weaknesses in content-based reasoning[Analysis Note #3].\n- The use of inner function attention in Cheems, where selective state space algorithms are used as inner functions, enhances state expressiveness and efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nHardware-aware implementations are crucial for practical deployment:\n- Techniques such as weight sparsity, token pruning, and sparse attention, as developed by Song Han's lab, can be exploited by hardware accelerators like EIE to improve efficiency.\n- System co-design approaches, such as those in QServe, integrate quantization and system optimization for efficient LLM serving.\n\n## Balancing Efficiency and Expressivity\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nHybrid architectures that combine different mechanisms can balance efficiency and expressivity:\n- Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms, as in Cheems, allows for efficient state compression while maintaining long-term dependencies and summary states.\n- Models like CHELA replace SSMs with short-long convolutions and implement linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, maintaining global abstraction and data-dependent selection[Analysis Note #3].\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014selective state space models, quantization and compression, sparse tensors and matrices, mixed experts with sparse activation, dynamic parameter adjustment, and hardware-aware implementations\u2014researchers can develop more efficient and expressive autoregressive language models. These approaches can help in achieving the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability.\n",

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/37 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.81)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/54 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nA.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/63 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\n# The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective \n\nYash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, Michael Hahn<br>Saarland Informatics Campus<br>Saarland University, Germany<br>\\{ysarrof, yanav, mhahn\\}@lst.uni-saarland.de\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nRecently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, constrained by the inherent geometric constraints of sequences, it still falls short in modeling long-range dependencies. To address this issue, we propose the GrootVL network, which first dynamically generates a tree topology based on spatial relationships and input features. Then, feature propagation is performed based on this graph, thereby breaking the original sequence constraints to achieve stronger representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a linear complexity dynamic programming algorithm to enhance long-range interactions without increasing computational cost. GrootVL is a versatile multimodal framework that can be applied to both visual and textual tasks.

A Multi-Resolution Framework for U-Nets with Applications to Hierarchical VAEs\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Fabian Falck, Christopher Williams, D. Danks, George Deligiannidis, C. Yau, Chris C. Holmes, A. Doucet, M. Willetts*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-resolution framework is formulated which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space and identifies state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs) as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi- resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** U-Net architectures are ubiquitous in state-of-the-art deep learning, however their regularisation properties and relationship to wavelets are understudied. In this paper, we formulate a multi-resolution framework which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space. We provide theoretical results which prove that average pooling corresponds to projection within the space of square-integrable functions and show that U-Nets with average pooling implicitly learn a Haar wavelet basis representation of the data. We then leverage our framework to identify state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs), which have a U-Net architecture, as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi-resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities. We also demonstrate that HVAEs learn a representation of time which allows for improved parameter efficiency through weight-sharing. We use this observation to achieve state-of-the-art HVAE performance with half the number of parameters of existing models, exploiting the properties of our continuous-time formulation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Deep Residual Output Layers for Neural Language Generation\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Nikolaos Pappas, James Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evaluations on three language generation tasks show that the output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing the structure of the output space.\n\n**Abstract:** Many tasks, including language generation, benefit from learning the structure of the output space, particularly when the space of output labels is large and the data is sparse. State-of-the-art neural language models indirectly capture the output space structure in their classifier weights since they lack parameter sharing across output labels. Learning shared output label mappings helps, but existing methods have limited expressivity and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of more powerful shared mappings for output labels, and propose a deep residual output mapping with dropout between layers to better capture the structure of the output space and avoid overfitting. Evaluations on three language generation tasks show that our output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing the structure of the output space.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hidden Parameter Recurrent State Space Models For Changing Dynamics Scenarios\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Vaisakh Shaj, Dieter Buchler, Rohit Sonker, P. Becker, G. Neumann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the Hidden Parameter Recurrent State Space Models (HiP-RSSMs), a framework that parametrizes a family of related dynamical systems with a low-dimensional set of latent factors that outperforms RSSMs and competing multi-task models on several challenging robotic benchmarks both on real-world systems and simulations.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent State-space models (RSSMs) are highly expressive models for learning patterns in time series data and system identification. However, these models assume that the dynamics are fixed and unchanging, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. Many control applications often exhibit tasks with similar but not identical dynamics which can be modeled as a latent variable. We introduce the Hidden Parameter Recurrent State Space Models (HiP-RSSMs), a framework that parametrizes a family of related dynamical systems with a low-dimensional set of latent factors. We present a simple and effective way of learning and performing inference over this Gaussian graphical model that avoids approximations like variational inference. We show that HiP-RSSMs outperforms RSSMs and competing multi-task models on several challenging robotic benchmarks both on real-world systems and simulations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 268  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Single-Path NAS: Designing Hardware-Efficient ConvNets in less than 4 Hours\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Ruizhou Ding, Jie Liu, Di Wang, Dimitrios Stamoulis, Bodhi Priyantha, Dimitrios Lymberopoulos, Diana Marculescu*\n\n**Abstract:** Can we automatically design a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) with the\nhighest image classification accuracy under the runtime constraint of a mobile\ndevice? Neural architecture search (NAS) has revolutionized the design of\nhardware-efficient ConvNets by automating this process. However, the NAS\nproblem remains challenging due to the combinatorially large design space,\ncausing a significant searching time (at least 200 GPU-hours). To alleviate\nthis complexity, we propose Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable NAS method\nfor designing hardware-efficient ConvNets in less than 4 hours. Our\ncontributions are as follows: 1. Single-path search space: Compared to previous\ndifferentiable NAS methods, Single-Path NAS uses one single-path\nover-parameterized ConvNet to encode all architectural decisions with shared\nconvolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the number of\ntrainable parameters and the search cost down to few epochs. 2.\nHardware-efficient ImageNet classification: Single-Path NAS achieves 74.96%\ntop-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, which is\nstate-of-the-art accuracy compared to NAS methods with similar constraints\n(<80ms). 3. NAS efficiency: Single-Path NAS search cost is only 8 epochs (30\nTPU-hours), which is up to 5,000x faster compared to prior work. 4.\nReproducibility: Unlike all recent mobile-efficient NAS methods which only\nrelease pretrained models, we open-source our entire codebase at:\nhttps://github.com/dstamoulis/single-path-nas.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. ProjE: Embedding Projection for Knowledge Graph Completion\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing state space models*\n\n*Tim Weninger, Baoxu Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** With the large volume of new information created every day, determining the\nvalidity of information in a knowledge graph and filling in its missing parts\nare crucial tasks for many researchers and practitioners. To address this\nchallenge, a number of knowledge graph completion methods have been developed\nusing low-dimensional graph embeddings. Although researchers continue to\nimprove these models using an increasingly complex feature space, we show that\nsimple changes in the architecture of the underlying model can outperform\nstate-of-the-art models without the need for complex feature engineering. In\nthis work, we present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE that\nfills-in missing information in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings\nof the knowledge graph's entities and edges, and through subtle, but important,\nchanges to the standard loss function. In doing so, ProjE has a parameter size\nthat is smaller than 11 out of 15 existing methods while performing $37\\%$\nbetter than the current-best method on standard datasets. We also show, via a\nnew fact checking task, that ProjE is capable of accurately determining the\nveracity of many declarative statements.\n\n**Published:** 2016-11-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state space models (SSMs) with a focus on efficient parameter sharing and state representation, several techniques and insights from the provided sources are particularly relevant:\n\n## Efficient Parameter Sharing\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\nThe paper on \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\" introduces methods that can be applied to SSMs to improve parameter efficiency. Specifically, it highlights the effectiveness of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variant, Selective Dimension LoRA (SDLoRA), which selectively update certain channels and states in SSM modules while applying LoRA to linear projection matrices. This approach maintains model expressivity while reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, thus improving efficiency.\n\n### Selective State Space Models\nThe work on \"Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\" discusses the use of selective SSMs, such as those in the Mamba architecture. These models allow for dynamic adjustment of SSM parameters based on the input content, which can improve content-based reasoning and reduce computational complexity. The paper proposes a unified post-training token reduction method that integrates token importance and similarity, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.\n\n## State Representation and Compression\n\n### Semantic Compression\nThe concept of semantic compression, as mentioned in the analysis note, is crucial for extending context handling without significant computational costs. This method, discussed in \"Extending Context Window,\" enables generalization to longer texts by compressing the context in a way that preserves semantic information. This can be particularly useful in SSMs to maintain expressivity while reducing memory requirements[Analysis Note #4].\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nCombining SSMs with selective attention mechanisms can enhance state representation efficiency. For example, the \"Samba\" model uses a hybrid approach that selectively compresses sequences into recurrent hidden states while maintaining the ability to recall memories using attention mechanisms. This balance between compression and information preservation is key to maintaining model expressivity and efficiency[Analysis Note #4].\n\n### State Space Duality and Selective Updates\nThe \"SC-MAMBA2\" model leverages state space duality (SSD) to simplify the matrix representations in SSMs, reducing them to scalar forms in certain cases. This simplification, along with selective state updates, can improve the efficiency and scalability of SSMs. The model also uses a bidirectional architecture to efficiently learn relationships among genes, which can be adapted to language modeling tasks.\n\n## Adaptive Learning and Contextual Updates\n\n### In-Context Learning\nThe paper on \"State-Space Models Adapt by Gradient Descent, Learning in Context\" demonstrates that SSMs can learn and adapt during the inference process using gradient descent. This ability to continuously update internal parameters based on the specific context can enhance the model's adaptability and performance in real-world applications where the data distribution or context is constantly changing.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop SSM-based autoregressive language models that maintain high expressivity while reducing computational complexity:\n\n- **Efficient Parameter Sharing**: Use methods like LoRA and SDLoRA for fine-tuning, and leverage selective SSMs to dynamically adjust parameters.\n- **State Representation and Compression**: Implement semantic compression and hybrid architectures that combine SSMs with selective attention.\n- **Adaptive Learning**: Utilize in-context learning via gradient descent to adapt the model to changing contexts.\n\nThese approaches can help achieve the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 3. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Neural Foundations of Mental Simulation: Future Prediction of Latent Representations on Dynamic Scenes\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion dense connections state space models*\n\n*Aran Nayebi, R. Rajalingham, M. Jazayeri, G. R. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The findings suggest that the neural mechanisms and behaviors of primate mental simulation have strong inductive biases associated with them, and are thus far most consistent with being optimized to future predict on reusable visual representations that are useful for Embodied AI more generally.\n\n**Abstract:** Humans and animals have a rich and flexible understanding of the physical world, which enables them to infer the underlying dynamical trajectories of objects and events, plausible future states, and use that to plan and anticipate the consequences of actions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these computations are unclear. We combine a goal-driven modeling approach with dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput human behavioral readouts that contain thousands of comparisons to directly impinge on this question. Specifically, we construct and evaluate several classes of sensory-cognitive networks to predict the future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging from self-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-slot objectives, to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-pretrained or dynamic video-pretrained foundation models. We find that \u201cscale is not all you need\u201d, and that many state-of-the-art machine learning models fail to perform well on our neural and behavioral benchmarks for future prediction. In fact, only one class of models matches these data well overall. We find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained to predict the future state of their environment in the latent space of pretrained foundation models optimized for dynamic scenes in a self-supervised manner. These models also approach the neurons\u2019 ability to predict the environmental state variables that are visually hidden from view, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Finally, we find that not all foundation model latents are equal. Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundation models that are optimized to support a diverse range of egocentric sensorimotor tasks, reasonably match both human behavioral error patterns and neural dynamics across all environmental scenarios that we were able to test. Overall, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms and behaviors of primate mental simulation have strong inductive biases associated with them, and are thus far most consistent with being optimized to future predict on reusable visual representations that are useful for Embodied AI more generally.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. CITADEL: Conditional Token Interaction via Dynamic Lexical Routing for Efficient and Effective Multi-Vector Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion dense connections state space models*\n\n*Minghan Li, Sheng-Chieh Lin, Barlas O\u011fuz, Asish Ghoshal, Jimmy J. Lin, Yashar Mehdad, Wen-tau Yih, Xilun Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** CITADEL learns to route different token vectors to the predicted lexical keys such that a query token vector only interacts with document token vectors routed to the same key, which significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining high accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-vector retrieval methods combine the merits of sparse (e.g. BM25) and dense (e.g. DPR) retrievers and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various retrieval tasks.These methods, however, are orders of magnitude slower and need much more space to store their indices compared to their single-vector counterparts.In this paper, we unify different multi-vector retrieval models from a token routing viewpoint and propose conditional token interaction via dynamic lexical routing, namely CITADEL, for efficient and effective multi-vector retrieval.CITADEL learns to route different token vectors to the predicted lexical keys such that a query token vector only interacts with document token vectors routed to the same key.This design significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining high accuracy.Notably, CITADEL achieves the same or slightly better performance than the previous state of the art, ColBERT-v2, on both in-domain (MS MARCO) and out-of-domain (BEIR) evaluations, while being nearly 40 times faster.

Do We Actually Need Dense Over-Parameterization? In-Time Over-Parameterization in Sparse Training\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion dense connections state space models*\n\n*Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin, D. Mocanu, Mykola Pechenizkiy*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new perspective on training deep neural networks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the expensive over-parameterization is introduced by proposing the concept of In-Time Over-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural networks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the expensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time Over-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random sparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during training, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its ability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the optimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that have been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense neural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support our conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance with ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant performance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme sparsity levels. When trained on CIFAR-100, our method can match the performance of the dense model even at an extreme sparsity (98%).

Shall We Pretrain Autoregressive Language Models with Retrieval? A Comprehensive Study\n\n*From Search Query: parameter efficiency expressiveness autoregressive language models*\n\n*Boxin Wang, Wei Ping, P. Xu, Lawrence C. McAfee, Zihan Liu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Yi Dong, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Bo Li, Chaowei Xiao, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM of RETRO, which outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration, moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database, and highlights the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large decoder-only language models (LMs) can be largely improved in terms of perplexity by retrieval (e.g., RETRO), but its impact on text generation quality and downstream task accuracy is unclear. Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT in both fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings. Our findings highlight the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models.

Boosting Inference Efficiency: Unleashing the Power of Parameter-Shared Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: parameter efficiency expressiveness autoregressive language models*\n\n*Weize Chen, Xiaoyue Xu, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs and proposes a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration.\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-shared pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as a successful approach in resource-constrained environments, enabling substantial reductions in model storage and memory costs without significant performance compromise. However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Fine-Tuning Language Models with Just Forward Passes\n\n*From Search Query: parameter efficiency expressiveness autoregressive language models*\n\n*Sadhika Malladi, Tianyu Gao, Eshaan Nichani, Alexandru Damian, Jason D. Lee, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference, and demonstrates that MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks, but as LMs grow in size, backpropagation requires a prohibitively large amount of memory. Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12x memory reduction and up to 2x GPU-hour reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We support our empirical findings with theoretical insights, highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting otherwise.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 122  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the proposed **DDLerpLinear-SC**, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n\n#### 1. **Integration of Semantic Compression, Selective State Updates, and Dynamic State Expansion**\n- **Search for Studies**: Look for research papers or technical documents that have successfully integrated semantic compression, selective state updates, and dynamic state expansion within autoregressive models or Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs).

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Semantic Compression:**\n  - The **Semantic Compression Module (SCM)** in DDLerpLinear-SC aligns with existing works like **LLMLingua** and **Fei et al., 2023**, which demonstrate that compressing semantic information can effectively extend context windows while maintaining performance. These studies validate the feasibility of incorporating SCM into GAUs to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n  \n- **Selective State Updates:**\n  - The **Selective Update Gate (SUG)** draws inspiration from models like **Skip RNNs**, which learn to selectively update states to enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. This mechanism can allow DDLerpLinear-SC to focus updates on semantically relevant states, reducing unnecessary computations and memory usage, thereby improving efficiency.\n  \n- **Dynamic State Expansion (DSE):**\n  - The **Dynamic State Expansion (DSE)** component is reminiscent of approaches in **Memory Transformers** and **Switching Autoregressive Low-rank Tensor Models (SALT)**, where dynamic adjustments to state representations help manage varying levels of semantic complexity and long-range dependencies. This flexibility can enhance the model's adaptability and scalability.\n  \n- **Dense Connections in State Space Models:**\n  - The **DenseMamba** approach underscores the importance of enhancing hidden state flows between layers in State Space Models (SSMs). By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for outputs. Integrating dense connections within GAUs, as suggested, could further improve expressiveness and information retention.\n  \n- **Parameter Efficiency and Expressiveness:**\n  - Combining **semantic compression**, **selective updates**, and **dynamic state expansion** addresses the trade-off between parameter efficiency and model expressiveness.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

These LLMs have demonstrated the ability to engage in fluent and coherent conversations with human users, and have shown exceptional performance across various tasks, including document summarization, question-answering, dialogue bots, and code generation copilots. One critical issue faced by state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs is the restriction on the length of text that can be inputted into the model at once. When the input context exceeds the limit of the context window, the performance of these models rapidly declines. This limitation poses a challenge when it comes to handling long texts such as scientific papers, novels, and legal contracts with current LLMs. As a result, there has been a growing interest in finding ways to extend the input length without significantly compromising the model's performance. The limitation on the context window primarily stems from the quadratic computation of the selfattention mechanism in the transformer. Handling lengthy texts significantly increases the computational costs in terms of memory and time. Typically, models are trained on short contexts, and the maximum sequence length (i.e., the context window) is determined. If the models are compelled to generate contexts that exceed the context window, they tend to compromise the quality of the output due to the lack of position encoding information during the training process. Furthermore, generating long sequences imposes substantial memory requirements on the computational device. This accumulation of memory requirements and the lack of effective position encoding can result in length generalization failure (Anil et al., 2022), where the models struggle to generate meaningful and coherent text beyond a certain context window size. Some approaches have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges. One approach is to devise architectures with nearly linear complexity, which enables efficient scaling to handle\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-02.jpg?height=139&width=919&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=603)\n\nFigure 1: With the inclusion of the semantic compression module, the redundancies in the input are eliminated, thereby effectively extending the context window. The semantic compression is reminiscent of the concept of source coding in information theory. very long sequences. However, training a large model from scratch incurs substantial cost. Another strategy involves employing interpolation and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the position encoding to unseen sequence lengths. While this method has the potential to compromise the overall performance of LLMs, it still demands significant time and GPU resources for fine-tuning and inference on long sequences. Therefore, it is more efficient and resource-friendly to design methods that do not necessitate altering the parameters of the pre-trained model. While most previous algorithms relied on modifying the pre-trained model, we instead exploit the statistical properties of input natural language. One empirical phenomenon, known as Zipf's law (Zipf, 2016), observes that a small set of the most frequent word tokens in a large corpus of natural language account for almost all occurrences.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nThis pattern arises from the tendency of language users to minimize effort in their daily conversations. Consequently, by utilizing an expanded vocabulary, sentences can be significantly shortened while preserving the same semantic meaning. Moreover, it is common for language users to include redundant words during communication (Strunk Jr, 2007). These language habits are prevalent among users, and we propose to include a semantic compression module to mitigate the redundancy associated with these habits. Our proposed semantic compression method, reminiscent of lossy source coding in information theory, extends the context window by equivalently shortening the long text while preserving the semantic meaning. This procedure is conducted before inputting the tokens into the pre-trained LLMs. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the input undergoes compression before being transmitted to the LLM for various potential tasks. The semantic compression method can be customized and optimized for downstream tasks, taking into consideration practical constraints such as time and memory resources. The implementation of the semantic compression module is straightforward and can easily be incorporated into other interpolation-based context window extension methods and black box APIs. It demonstrates enhanced performance compared to SoTA interpolation-based methods on a range of tasks, including single-document question answering, multi-document question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval, using real-world datasets while incurring no extra parameter updates or memory consumption. Empirically, the proposed method is computational efficient and achieves 6-8 times context window extension. ## Our contributions:\n\n- We introduce a context window extension framework for LLMs that utilizes semantic compression. This framework serves as a plug-and-play tool to mitigate redundancy in input texts by efficiently performing topic modeling. - We construct a graph representation of the input to identify distinct sections of the text that pertain to different topics. The result is the segmentation of long texts into separate chunks, each focusing on a specific topic. We then conquer each chunk independently, resulting in a concise version of the original texts. This compression technique helps to condense the information while preserving the key ideas and context. - We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed semantic compression method through extensive experiments. The results highlight the advantages of our method in several key applications, including single-document question answering, multi-document question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nWith the advancement of SoTA LLMs, significant progress has been made in extending the context window lengths. ### 2.1 EXTRAPOLATION AND INTERPOLATION\n\nThe mainstream line of research aims to adapt existing language models trained on short texts to accommodate longer ones during inference (Anil et al., 2022). The key idea is to modify the positional embedding, which has only been trained on short texts. Several studies are based on the Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) of LLaMA and methods of adjusting it to the longer sequences. Chen et al. (2023a) develops the Position Interpolation (PI) method to linearly scale the input positional indices. Peng et al. (2023) presents YaRN, an efficient extrapolate mechanism inspired by the neural tangent kernel, to extend the context window to 64 k and 128 k . ### 2.2 EFFICIENT ATTENTION OpERATIONS\n\nDue to the self-attention mechanism, the inference cost of LLMs grows quadratically with the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 3.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 12 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: semantic compression in language models, selective state updates in neural networks, dynamic state expansion in autoregressive models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

With advancements in technologies such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL), the prompts fed to LLMs are becoming increasingly lengthy, even exceeding tens of thousands of tokens. To accelerate model inference and reduce cost, this paper presents LLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method that involves a budget controller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, a token-level iterative compression algorithm to better model the interdependence between compressed contents, and an instruction tuning based method for distribution alignment between language models. We conduct experiments and analysis over four datasets from different scenarios, i.e., GSM8K, BBH, ShareGPT, and Arxiv-March23; showing that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance and allows for up to 20x compression with little performance loss.

One popular usage of such models is leveraging its in-context learning ability and generating responses given user queries leveraging knowledge obtained by retrieval augmentation. One problem of deploying commercial retrieval-augmented LLMs is the cost due to the additionally retrieved context that largely increases the input token size of the LLMs. To mitigate this, we propose a token compression scheme that includes two methods: summarization compression and semantic compression. The first method applies a T5-based model that is fine-tuned by datasets generated using self-instruct containing samples with varying lengths and reduce token size by doing summarization. The second method further compresses the token size by removing words with lower impact on the semantic. In order to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we propose and utilize a dataset called Food-Recommendation DB (FRDB) focusing on food recommendation for women around pregnancy period or infants. Our summarization compression can reduce 65% of the retrieval token size with further 0.3% improvement on the accuracy; semantic compression provides a more flexible way to trade-off the token size with performance, for which we can reduce the token size by 20% with only 1.6% of accuracy drop.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph.

Rotational Equilibrium: How Weight Decay Balances Learning Across Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates in neural networks*\n\n*Atli Kosson, Bettina Messmer, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study investigates how weight decay affects the update behavior of individual neurons in deep neural networks through a combination of applied analysis and experimentation, offering a new simple perspective on training that elucidates the efficacy of widely used but poorly understood methods in deep learning.\n\n**Abstract:** This study investigates how weight decay affects the update behavior of individual neurons in deep neural networks through a combination of applied analysis and experimentation. Weight decay can cause the expected magnitude and angular updates of a neuron's weight vector to converge to a steady state we call rotational equilibrium. These states can be highly homogeneous, effectively balancing the average rotation -- a proxy for the effective learning rate -- across different layers and neurons. Our work analyzes these dynamics across optimizers like Adam, Lion, and SGD with momentum, offering a new simple perspective on training that elucidates the efficacy of widely used but poorly understood methods in deep learning. We demonstrate how balanced rotation plays a key role in the effectiveness of normalization like Weight Standardization, as well as that of AdamW over Adam with L2-regularization. Finally, we show that explicitly controlling the rotation provides the benefits of weight decay while substantially reducing the need for learning rate warmup.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. SparseProp: Efficient Event-Based Simulation and Training of Sparse Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates in neural networks*\n\n*Rainer Engelken*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired models that are capable of processing information in streams of action potentials. However, simulating and training SNNs is computationally expensive due to the need to solve large systems of coupled differential equations. In this paper, we introduce SparseProp, a novel event-based algorithm for simulating and training sparse SNNs. Our algorithm reduces the computational cost of both the forward and backward pass operations from O(N) to O(log(N)) per network spike, thereby enabling numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and their efficient training using backpropagation through time. By leveraging the sparsity of the network, SparseProp eliminates the need to iterate through all neurons at each spike, employing efficient state updates instead. We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseProp across several classical integrate-and-fire neuron models, including a simulation of a sparse SNN with one million LIF neurons. This results in a speed-up exceeding four orders of magnitude relative to previous event-based implementations. Our work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Learning Non-Autoregressive Models from Search for Unsupervised Sentence Summarization\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion in autoregressive models*\n\n*Puyuan Liu, Chenyang Huang, Lili Mou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a Non-Autoregressive Unsupervised Summarization (NAUS) approach, which does not require parallel data for training, and first performs edit-based search towards a heuristically defined score, and generates a summary as pseudo-groundtruth.\n\n**Abstract:** Text summarization aims to generate a short summary for an input text. In this work, we propose a Non-Autoregressive Unsupervised Summarization (NAUS) approach, which does not require parallel data for training. Our NAUS first performs edit-based search towards a heuristically defined score, and generates a summary as pseudo-groundtruth. Then, we train an encoder-only non-autoregressive Transformer based on the search result. We also propose a dynamic programming approach for length-control decoding, which is important for the summarization task. Experiments on two datasets show that NAUS achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised summarization, yet largely improving inference efficiency. Further, our algorithm is able to perform explicit length-transfer summary generation.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion in autoregressive models*\n\n*Hung Le, R. Socher, S. Hoi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself. These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 8. Switching Autoregressive Low-rank Tensor Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion in autoregressive models*\n\n*Hyun Dong Lee, Andrew Warrington, Joshua I. Glaser, Scott W. Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes switching autoregressive low-rank tensor (SALT) models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses of ARHMMs and SLDSs, and empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** An important problem in time-series analysis is modeling systems with time-varying dynamics. Probabilistic models with joint continuous and discrete latent states offer interpretable, efficient, and experimentally useful descriptions of such data. Commonly used models include autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. ARHMMs permit exact inference and easy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long dependencies, and hence are prone to overfitting. In contrast, SLDSs can capture long-range dependencies in a parameter efficient way through Markovian latent dynamics, but present an intractable likelihood and a challenging parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose switching autoregressive low-rank tensor (SALT) models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses. SALT parameterizes the tensor of an ARHMM with a low-rank factorization to control the number of parameters and allow longer range dependencies without overfitting. We prove theoretical and discuss practical connections between SALT, linear dynamical systems, and SLDSs. We empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets. Furthermore, the learned low-rank tensor provides novel insights into temporal dependencies within each discrete state.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Semantic Compression\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression in language models*\n\n*Wei Han, Lei Deng, Bo Bai, Lu Hou, Pingyi Zhou, Xueyan Niu, Weizhi Fei*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) often impose limitations on the length of the text input to ensure the generation of fluent and relevant responses. This constraint restricts their applicability in scenarios involving long texts. We propose a novel semantic compression method that enables generalization to texts that are 6-8 times longer, without incurring significant computational costs or requiring fine-tuning. Our proposed framework draws inspiration from source coding in information theory and employs a pre-trained model to reduce the semantic redundancy of long inputs before passing them to the LLMs for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively extends the context window of LLMs across a range of tasks including question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval. Furthermore, the proposed semantic compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while reducing the associated computational overhead.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. DeCo: Decoupling Token Compression from Semantic Abstraction in Multimodal Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression in language models*\n\n*Lu Hou, Xu sun, Yuanxin Liu, Lean Wang, Shuhuai Ren, Lei LI, Linli Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** The visual projector, which bridges the vision and language modalities and facilitates cross-modal alignment, serves as a crucial component in MLLMs. However, measuring the effectiveness of projectors in vision-language alignment remains under-explored, which currently can only be inferred from the performance of MLLMs on downstream tasks. Motivated by the problem, this study examines the projector module by interpreting the vision-language semantic flow within MLLMs. Specifically, we trace back the semantic relevance flow from generated language tokens to raw visual encoder patches and the intermediate outputs produced by projectors. Our findings reveal that compressive projectors (e.g., QFormer), abstract visual patches into a limited set of semantic concepts, such as objects or attributes, resulting in a 'double abstraction' phenomenon. This involves a first visual semantic abstraction by the projector referring to pre-defined query tokens, and a second extraction by the LLM based on text instructions. The double abstraction is inefficient in training and will result in cumulative vision semantics deficiency. To mitigate this issue, we propose the key insight of 'Decouple Compression from Abstraction (DeCo), that is compressing the visual token number at the patch level by projectors and allowing the LLM to handle visual semantic abstraction entirely. Consequently, we adopt a simple compressor, i.e., 2D Adaptive Pooling, to downsample visual patches in a parameter-free manner. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DeCo surpasses traditional compressive projectors regarding both performance and efficiency. It achieves performance gains of 0.9%, 7.1%, and 2.9% across the MLLM Benchmarks, Visual Localization, and Open-ended VQA tasks with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence speed.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates in neural networks*\n\n*Anton Peganov, Yuri Kuratov, Grigory V. Sapunov, Mikhail S. Burtsev*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. The self-attention architecture allows transformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, information about the context is stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. This might limit the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3) controlling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively correlates with the model performance for machine translation and language modelling tasks. Augmentation of pre-trained masked language model with memory tokens shows mixed results for tasks from GLUE benchmark. Visualization of attention patterns over the memory suggest that it improves the model's ability to process a global context.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-20\n\n\n\n\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Learning Non-Autoregressive Models from Search for Unsupervised Sentence Summarization\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion autoregressive models*\n\n*Puyuan Liu, Chenyang Huang, Lili Mou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a Non-Autoregressive Unsupervised Summarization (NAUS) approach, which does not require parallel data for training, and first performs edit-based search towards a heuristically defined score, and generates a summary as pseudo-groundtruth.\n\n**Abstract:** Text summarization aims to generate a short summary for an input text. In this work, we propose a Non-Autoregressive Unsupervised Summarization (NAUS) approach, which does not require parallel data for training. Our NAUS first performs edit-based search towards a heuristically defined score, and generates a summary as pseudo-groundtruth. Then, we train an encoder-only non-autoregressive Transformer based on the search result. We also propose a dynamic programming approach for length-control decoding, which is important for the summarization task. Experiments on two datasets show that NAUS achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised summarization, yet largely improving inference efficiency. Further, our algorithm is able to perform explicit length-transfer summary generation.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion autoregressive models*\n\n*Hung Le, R. Socher, S. Hoi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself. These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3. Switching Autoregressive Low-rank Tensor Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic state expansion autoregressive models*\n\n*Hyun Dong Lee, Andrew Warrington, Joshua I. Glaser, Scott W. Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes switching autoregressive low-rank tensor (SALT) models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses of ARHMMs and SLDSs, and empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** An important problem in time-series analysis is modeling systems with time-varying dynamics. Probabilistic models with joint continuous and discrete latent states offer interpretable, efficient, and experimentally useful descriptions of such data. Commonly used models include autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. ARHMMs permit exact inference and easy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long dependencies, and hence are prone to overfitting. In contrast, SLDSs can capture long-range dependencies in a parameter efficient way through Markovian latent dynamics, but present an intractable likelihood and a challenging parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose switching autoregressive low-rank tensor (SALT) models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses. SALT parameterizes the tensor of an ARHMM with a low-rank factorization to control the number of parameters and allow longer range dependencies without overfitting. We prove theoretical and discuss practical connections between SALT, linear dynamical systems, and SLDSs. We empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets. Furthermore, the learned low-rank tensor provides novel insights into temporal dependencies within each discrete state.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the proposed **DDLerpLinear-SC**, that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### 1.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Semantic Compression:** The proposal's **Semantic Compression Module (SCM)** aligns closely with existing works like LLMLingua and TCRA-LLM, which demonstrate the effectiveness of compressing input semantics to extend context windows significantly. These works highlight that semantic compression can maintain performance while reducing input size, supporting the feasibility of incorporating SCM into DDLerpLinear-SC.\n\n- **Selective State Updates:** The introduction of a **Selective Update Gate (SUG)** draws inspiration from models like Skip RNNs, which learn to skip unnecessary state updates to enhance computational efficiency. This mechanism can potentially allow DDLerpLinear-SC to focus updates on semantically relevant states, improving both efficiency and model performance.\n\n- **Dynamic State Expansion:** While direct parallels are less evident, frameworks like Memory Transformer and Switching Autoregressive Models indicate the importance of dynamic and flexible state representations. The proposed **Dynamic State Expansion (DSE)** component aims to adapt the state size based on context, which could enhance the model's ability to manage varying semantic complexities effectively.\n\n- **Integration of Modules:** Combining SCM, SUG, and DSE within the GAU framework appears novel. Existing literature treats semantic compression and selective updates largely independently. The integrated approach in DDLerpLinear-SC could offer unique benefits by synergizing these mechanisms to optimize state management dynamically.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance:**\n  - **Accuracy:** Enhanced state management is likely to improve the model's ability to retain and utilize relevant information over long sequences, potentially leading to better accuracy on downstream tasks.\n  - **Robustness:** Selective updates can make the model more resilient to noise by focusing computational resources on semantically significant inputs.\n  - **Efficiency:** Semantic compression and selective updates are expected to reduce computational and memory overhead, leading to faster inference times and lower operational costs.\n  - **Scalability:** The dynamic nature of state expansion suggests that DDLerpLinear-SC can scale more effectively with increasing data sizes and model complexities.\n\n- **Novelty:** The integration of semantic compression with selective state updates within a dynamic state expansion framework in GAUs appears to be a novel approach. While individual components have been explored, their combined application in enhancing GAUs for autoregressive models has not been comprehensively addressed in existing literature.\n\n**4.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

The Illusion of State in State-Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Analysis of state-space models reveals that SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill&Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the\"state\"in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/39 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\narXiv:2312.00752.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

It's Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections state space models autoregressive language models*\n\n*Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Chris Donahue, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling, is proposed, identifying that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and providing a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices.

Towards Robust Pruning: An Adaptive Knowledge-Retention Pruning Strategy for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections state space models autoregressive language models*\n\n*Jianwei Li, Qi Lei, Wei Cheng, Dongkuan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass, and introduces a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre- trained knowledge during the pruning process.\n\n**Abstract:** The pruning objective has recently extended beyond accuracy and sparsity to robustness in language models. Despite this, existing methods struggle to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks when continually increasing model sparsity and require a retraining process. As humans step into the era of large language models, these issues become increasingly prominent. This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass. Accordingly, we introduce a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre-trained knowledge during the pruning process. In this setup, each layer's reconstruction error not only originates from itself but also includes cumulative error from preceding layers, followed by an adaptive rectification. Compared to other state-of-art baselines, our approach demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy, sparsity, robustness, and pruning cost with BERT on datasets SST2, IMDB, and AGNews, marking a significant stride towards robust pruning in language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the proposed **DDLerpLinear-SC**, that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Integration of Semantic Compression and Selective State Updates\n\n- **Existing Works:**\n  - The researcher has already identified several relevant studies, such as **LLMLingua** and **Extending Context Window via Semantic Compression**, which demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic compression in extending context windows and maintaining performance.

The proposed enhancements aim to maintain or even improve model performance while reducing redundant computations and memory usage, aligning with the goals of maintaining low perplexity and high accuracy.\n\n- **Novelty Assessment:**\n  - While individual components like semantic compression and selective state updates have been explored in existing research, the **integration** of these mechanisms within a **Dynamic State Expansion** framework in GAUs appears to be novel. The proposal's holistic approach to enhancing state management dynamically and semantically within autoregressive models distinguishes it from prior works that typically treat these mechanisms independently.\n\n- **Potential Impact:**\n  - **Accuracy:** Enhanced state management through semantic compression and selective updates is likely to improve the model's ability to retain and utilize relevant information over longer sequences, leading to better performance on tasks requiring understanding of long-term dependencies.\n  - **Robustness:** Adaptive state representations can make the model more resilient to noisy or irrelevant inputs by focusing computational resources on semantically significant information.\n  - **Efficiency:** Semantic compression and selective updates are expected to reduce computational and memory overhead, leading to faster inference times and lower operational costs.\n  - **Scalability:** The dynamic nature of state expansion suggests that DDLerpLinear-SC can scale more effectively with increasing data sizes and model complexities.\n\n**4. Future Search Plan or Next Steps:**\n\n- **Refine and Expand Search Queries:**\n  - Focus on the **integration** of semantic compression, selective state updates, and dynamic state expansion within autoregressive models and GAUs.\n  - Explore literature that combines multiple state management techniques to identify best practices and potential challenges.\n  - Investigate **dense connections** within State Space Models and their impact on information flow and model performance.\n\n- **Target Specific Architectures and Implementations:**\n  - Look for case studies or implementations where semantic compression and selective updates are combined within similar frameworks.\n  - Examine how dynamic state expansion has been approached in other GAUs or modular architectures to understand integration complexities.\n\n- **Explore Empirical Studies and Benchmarks:**\n  - Identify studies that evaluate the combined impact of semantic compression and selective updates on model performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.\n  - Seek out benchmarks that specifically test long-range dependency handling and parameter efficiency to assess the proposal's potential effectiveness.\n\n- **Investigate Theoretical Foundations:**\n  - Delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of integrating semantic compression with selective updates and dynamic state expansion to ensure that the proposed modifications enhance rather than hinder the model's representational capabilities.\n  - Explore how dense connections in SSMs contribute to information retention and model expressiveness, and how these principles can be applied to GAUs.\n\n- **Examine Related Work on Dense Connections:**\n  - Study the **DenseMamba** approach and similar methodologies to understand how dense connections can be effectively integrated into SSMs and potentially GAUs.\n  - Assess the scalability and performance implications of enhancing state flows between layers through dense connections.\n\n**5.

    "proposal": "# DDLerpLinear-SC: Semantic Compression Enhanced Dynamic Linear Interpolation\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face significant challenges in efficiently handling long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The original DDLerpLinear unit in RWKV6 provides an efficient mechanism for parameter sharing through linear interpolation, but it could benefit from more sophisticated state management and compression techniques. Recent advances in semantic compression and selective state updates suggest potential improvements to the architecture's efficiency and expressivity.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe current DDLerpLinear implementation has several limitations:\n\n1. Fixed state representation regardless of input content\n2. Uniform parameter sharing across all contexts\n3. Limited ability to compress and expand state information dynamically\n4. Potential redundancy in state representation for similar semantic content\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nWe propose enhancing DDLerpLinear with semantic compression and selective state updates, allowing the model to:\n\n1. Dynamically compress state information based on semantic content\n2. Selectively update parameters based on input relevance\n3. Maintain efficient linear interpolation while improving expressivity\n4. Better handle long-range dependencies through compressed state representation\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe DDLerpLinear-SC unit extends the original DDLerpLinear with three key components:\n\n1. Semantic Compression Module (SCM)\n2. Selective Update Gate (SUG)\n3. Dynamic State Expansion (DSE)\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\nGiven input x and state \u03bc:\n\n1. Semantic Compression:\n```python\nc = SCM(x) = \u03c3(Wc \u00b7 x + bc) \u2299 x\n```\nwhere \u03c3 is sigmoid activation and \u2299 is element-wise multiplication.\n\n2. Selective Update:\n```python\ng = SUG(x, \u03bc) = \u03c3(Wg \u00b7 [x; \u03bc] + bg)\n\u03bc_compressed = g \u2299 \u03bc + (1 - g) \u2299 c\n```\n\n3. Dynamic State Expansion:\n```python\n\u03bc_expanded = DSE(\u03bc_compressed) = Wd \u00b7 \u03bc_compressed + bd\n```\n\n4. Final Output:\n```python\ny = x + \u03b4 \u2299 \u03bc_expanded\n```\nwhere \u03b4 is the time-shift difference.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n```python\nclass DDLerpLinearSC(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, output_dim, compression_ratio=0.5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.scm = SemanticCompressionModule(embed_dim, compression_ratio)\n        self.sug = SelectiveUpdateGate(embed_dim)\n        self.dse = DynamicStateExpansion(embed_dim)\n        self.time_shift = nn.ZeroPad2d((0, 0, 1, -1))\n        \n    def forward(self, x, mu, delta=None):\n        if delta is None:\n            shifted = self.time_shift(x)\n            delta = shifted - x\n            \n        # Semantic compression\n        c = self.scm(x)\n        \n        # Selective update\n        g = self.sug(x, mu)\n        mu_compressed = g * mu + (1 - g) * c\n        \n        # Dynamic expansion\n        mu_expanded = self.dse(mu_compressed)\n        \n        # Final output\n        y = x + delta * mu_expanded\n        return y, mu_expanded\n```\n\n## Research Summary\n\nKey findings from research:\n\n1. Semantic compression can effectively extend context handling without significant computational costs\n2. Selective state updates improve parameter efficiency and model expressivity\n3. Dynamic parameter adjustment based on input content enhances model performance\n4. Hybrid approaches combining compression with selective updates show promising results\n\n## Evolution of Design\n\nThe design evolved through several iterations:\n\n1. Initial focus on pure compression techniques\n2. Integration of selective update mechanisms\n3. Addition of dynamic state expansion\n4. Fine-tuning of compression ratios and update gates\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\n### Advantages\n\n1. Improved Parameter Efficiency:\n   - Semantic compression reduces redundant state information\n   - Selective updates focus computation on relevant features\n\n2. Enhanced Expressivity:\n   - Dynamic state expansion allows for context-dependent representation\n   - Compressed states maintain essential semantic information\n\n3. Computational Efficiency:\n   - Linear complexity maintained through careful design\n   - Reduced memory footprint through semantic compression\n\n### Trade-offs\n\n1. Additional Parameters:\n   - Compression and expansion modules introduce new parameters\n   - Mitigated by reduced state size and selective updates\n\n2. Training Complexity:\n   - More sophisticated architecture requires careful initialization\n   - Potential for longer training time to learn optimal compression\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDDLerpLinear-SC represents a significant advancement in efficient state representation for language models. By incorporating semantic compression and selective updates, it maintains the computational efficiency of the original DDLerpLinear while improving expressivity and parameter utilization. The design is particularly well-suited for handling long-range dependencies and should scale effectively to larger models and datasets.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Sarrof, Y., Veitsman, Y., & Hahn, M.
