    "review": "**Comprehensive Analysis of the Proposal: CompressedStateTTTLinear: Memory-Efficient State Management for Test-Time Training**\n\n### **1. Clarity**\n\nThe proposal for **CompressedStateTTTLinear** is well-articulated and presents a clear objective: to enhance the existing **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating **adaptive state compression**, **efficient memory management**, **block-based processing**, and **hardware-optimized operations**. The motivation, problem analysis, and core ideas are logically structured, providing a coherent narrative that outlines the specific challenges being addressed and the proposed solutions. The design plan is detailed, including mathematical formulations and pseudo-code, which aids in understanding the intended modifications and their implementations.\n\n### **2. Innovation**\n\nThe proposed modifications introduce a high degree of innovation by combining several advanced techniques that have not been jointly explored in existing research. Specifically:\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: Dynamically compressing the model's state based on content importance is a novel approach that can significantly reduce memory usage while preserving essential information.\n  \n- **Integration with RWKV Architecture**: While adaptations of GAUs with architectures like SSMs (Selective State Spaces) exist (e.g., Mamba), the direct integration of GAUs with the RWKV architecture using adaptive state compression and block-based processing remains largely unexplored. This integration presents a unique advancement in the field.\n\n- **Block-Based Processing and Hardware Optimizations**: The emphasis on dividing computations into manageable blocks and optimizing operations for hardware efficiency aligns with current trends but applies them in a novel context within GAUs and the RWKV framework.\n\nOverall, the proposal stands out by introducing a comprehensive set of enhancements that collectively push the boundaries of existing autoregressive language model designs.\n\n### **3. Feasibility**\n\nThe design appears feasible, supported by insights from related works such as **Mamba** and **RRWKV**, which demonstrate successful integrations of GAUs with other architectures and efficient state management techniques. However, several factors could influence the feasibility:\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating multiple advanced techniques (adaptive state compression, block-based processing, hardware optimizations) may introduce significant complexity. Careful modular implementation and thorough testing are essential to address potential integration challenges.\n\n- **Empirical Validation**: The proposal primarily presents theoretical enhancements. Implementing these modifications and conducting empirical evaluations are critical next steps to validate the proposed benefits and identify any unforeseen issues.\n\n- **Resource Requirements**: While aiming for efficiency, the initial development and testing phases may require substantial computational resources to experiment with different configurations and optimizations.\n\n### **4. Scalability**\n\nThe proposed enhancements are well-aligned with scalability goals:\n\n- **Linear Complexity**: By reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to sequence length through Gated Linear Attention and adaptive state compression, the model is poised to handle longer sequences more efficiently.\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Adaptive state compression and block-based processing are designed to optimize memory usage, enabling the model to scale without proportionally increasing memory requirements.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Tailoring operations to leverage hardware capabilities ensures that scalability is complemented by actual performance gains on modern hardware architectures.\n\nThese aspects collectively suggest that **CompressedStateTTTLinear** will scale effectively with larger models and more extensive datasets.\n\n### **5. Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nThe integration of adaptive state compression can positively impact the model\u2019s **accuracy** and **robustness** by:\n\n- **Focus on Important Features**: Dynamically allocating computational resources to more informative parts of the input can enhance the model's ability to capture relevant patterns, potentially improving accuracy.\n\n- **Handling Long-Range Dependencies**: Efficient state management tailored to long sequences may strengthen the model\u2019s capability to maintain and utilize information over extended contexts, enhancing performance on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.\n\nHowever, without empirical evaluations, the actual impact on accuracy and robustness remains to be validated. There is also a need to ensure that compression techniques do not inadvertently discard critical information, which could compromise model performance.\n\n### **6. Efficiency**\n\nThe proposed design offers substantial improvements in computational and memory efficiency:\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: Reduces memory footprint by selectively compressing less important state information, allowing more efficient use of memory resources.\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: Facilitates parallel processing and optimized memory access patterns, enhancing computational throughput and reducing latency.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Tailoring operations to exploit hardware-specific features (e.g., tensor cores) can significantly accelerate both training and inference processes.\n\nThese efficiency gains are crucial for deploying large-scale language models in resource-constrained environments, making the proposal highly relevant and impactful.\n\n### **Strengths and Concerns**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **High Novelty**: The unique integration of adaptive state compression with GAUs and the RWKV architecture sets the proposal apart from existing models.\n   \n2. **Comprehensive Enhancements**: Combining multiple optimization techniques (adaptive compression, block processing, hardware optimizations) addresses a broad spectrum of efficiency and scalability challenges.\n\n3. **Alignment with Research Trends**: The proposal is in line with current advancements focusing on efficient attention mechanisms and scalable memory management in language models.\n\n4. **Potential for Significant Efficiency Gains**: The design promises substantial improvements in memory and computational efficiency, which are critical for large-scale deployments.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The proposal is primarily theoretical, with no presented empirical results to substantiate the claimed benefits.\n   \n2. **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating multiple advanced techniques may result in a complex implementation process, potentially leading to unforeseen challenges.\n\n3. **Risk of Information Loss**: Adaptive state compression must be carefully designed to avoid discarding vital information, which could negatively impact model performance.\n\n4. **Hardware Compatibility**: Ensuring that hardware optimizations are compatible across various platforms may require additional considerations and adaptations.\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1. **Conduct Empirical Studies**: Implement the proposed modifications and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations to validate the theoretical benefits, focusing on accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n2. **Detailed Implementation Guidelines**: Provide more granular implementation details, possibly including code snippets or architectural diagrams, to facilitate practical adoption and replication.\n\n3. **Modular Design Approach**: Adopt a modular design framework to simplify the integration of different optimization techniques, making the implementation process more manageable and reducing the risk of errors.\n\n4. **Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis**: Establish a robust benchmarking protocol comparing **CompressedStateTTTLinear** against existing models like **Mamba** and **RWKV**, across various tasks and sequence lengths.\n\n5. **Address Potential Trade-offs**: Explore and document any trade-offs between memory efficiency and model expressiveness, ensuring that compression techniques do not compromise essential model capabilities.\n\n6. **Hardware Optimization Flexibility**: Design hardware optimizations to be adaptable across different platforms, enhancing the model\u2019s versatility and deployment potential.\n\n### **Final Rating**\n\n```rating 4.2```\n\nThe **CompressedStateTTTLinear** proposal exhibits a high level of innovation and aligns well with current research trends in efficient and scalable language models. Its comprehensive approach to enhancing computational and memory efficiency through adaptive state compression, block-based processing, and hardware optimizations holds significant promise. However, the lack of empirical validation and the complexity of implementing multiple advanced techniques suggest that while the design is excellent and well-conceived, further practical exploration and testing are necessary to fully realize its potential and address any integration challenges.",

Coneheads: Hierarchy Aware Attention (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Albert Tseng, Tao Yu, Toni J.B. Liu, Chris De Sa*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Cone attention is introduced, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters, suggesting that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention networks such as transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains. These networks rely heavily on the dot product attention operator, which computes the similarity between two points by taking their inner product. However, the inner product does not explicitly model the complex structural properties of real world datasets, such as hierarchies between data points. To remedy this, we introduce cone attention, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones. Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones, which intuitively measures the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it improves task-level performance over dot product attention and other baselines, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters. Our results suggest that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/31 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2103.02143, 2021.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.78)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.62)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.35)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

To improve accuracy and energy efficiency of SNNs, most previous studies have focused solely on training methods, and the effect of architecture has rarely been studied. We investigate the design choices used in the previous studies in terms of the accuracy and number of spikes and figure out that they are not best-suited for SNNs. To further improve the accuracy and reduce the spikes generated by SNNs, we propose a spike-aware neural architecture search framework called AutoSNN. We define a search space consisting of architectures without undesirable design choices. To enable the spike-aware architecture search, we introduce a fitness that considers both the accuracy and number of spikes. AutoSNN successfully searches for SNN architectures that outperform hand-crafted SNNs in accuracy and energy efficiency. We thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSNN on various datasets including neuromorphic datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2.

However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks.

In particular, Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) have improved a wide variety of tasks, from machine translation to knowledge graph embedding. Although some studies have reported the effectiveness of embedding into the product of multiple hyperbolic spaces, HNNs have mainly been constructed in a single hyperbolic space, and their extension to product spaces has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, we propose a novel method to extend a given HNN in a single space to a product of hyperbolic spaces. We apply our method to Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs), extending several HNNs. Our model improved the graph node classification accuracy especially on datasets with tree-like structures. The results suggest that neural networks in a product of hyperbolic spaces can be more effective than in a single space in representing structural data.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hyperbolic neural networks efficient attention*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Hyperbolic Representation Learning for Fast and Efficient Neural Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: hyperbolic neural networks efficient attention*\n\n*Luu Anh Tuan, Yi Tay, Siu Cheung Hui*\n\n**Abstract:** The dominant neural architectures in question answer retrieval are based on\nrecurrent or convolutional encoders configured with complex word matching\nlayers. Given that recent architectural innovations are mostly new word\ninteraction layers or attention-based matching mechanisms, it seems to be a\nwell-established fact that these components are mandatory for good performance.\nUnfortunately, the memory and computation cost incurred by these complex\nmechanisms are undesirable for practical applications. As such, this paper\ntackles the question of whether it is possible to achieve competitive\nperformance with simple neural architectures. We propose a simple but novel\ndeep learning architecture for fast and efficient question-answer ranking and\nretrieval. More specifically, our proposed model, \\textsc{HyperQA}, is a\nparameter efficient neural network that outperforms other parameter intensive\nmodels such as Attentive Pooling BiLSTMs and Multi-Perspective CNNs on multiple\nQA benchmarks. The novelty behind \\textsc{HyperQA} is a pairwise ranking\nobjective that models the relationship between question and answer embeddings\nin Hyperbolic space instead of Euclidean space. This empowers our model with a\nself-organizing ability and enables automatic discovery of latent hierarchies\nwhile learning embeddings of questions and answers.

Hypformer: Exploring Efficient Hyperbolic Transformer Fully in Hyperbolic Space\n\n*From Search Query: hyperbolic neural networks efficient attention*\n\n*Rex Ying, Irwin King, Jiahong Liu, Delvin Ce Zhang, Harshit Verma, Menglin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperbolic geometry have shown significant potential in modeling complex structured data, particularly those with underlying tree-like and hierarchical structures. Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural networks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to hyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on modifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts have fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems primarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space, including linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions, dropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing hyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which hinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a novel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry. In Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential modules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a linear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic Transformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for the first time. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Hypformer across various datasets, demonstrating its potential as an effective and scalable solution for large-scale data representation and large models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hyperbolic Neural Networks++\n\n*From Search Query: hyperbolic neural networks efficient attention*\n\n*Ryohei Shimizu, Yusuke Mukuta, Tatsuya Harada*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperbolic spaces, which have the capacity to embed tree structures without distortion owing to their exponential volume growth, have recently been applied to machine learning to better capture the hierarchical nature of data. In this study, we generalize the fundamental components of neural networks in a single hyperbolic geometry model, namely, the Poincar\\'e ball model. This novel methodology constructs a multinomial logistic regression, fully-connected layers, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms under a unified mathematical interpretation, without increasing the parameters. Experiments show the superior parameter efficiency of our methods compared to conventional hyperbolic components, and stability and outperformance over their Euclidean counterparts.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design, particularly focusing on the integration of hyperbolic neural networks and efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key points and recent advances that can be beneficial:\n\n## Hyperbolic Neural Networks and Hierarchical Attention\n\n### Hyperbolic Geometry for Hierarchical Representation\nHyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have shown promise in representing hierarchical structures, which is crucial for processing long sequences and capturing long-range dependencies. The use of hyperbolic geometry allows for natural hierarchy representation, as seen in the \"Coneheads\" approach. This method introduces a hierarchy-aware attention mechanism that associates points based on the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones. This approach matches performance with fewer parameters and is based on hyperbolic geometry principles.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nThe \"Coneheads\" paper highlights the efficiency of using hyperbolic geometry for attention mechanisms. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic space, these models can capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures more effectively than traditional Euclidean models. This hierarchy-aware attention can be particularly beneficial for long document processing and extending context windows efficiently.\n\n## Efficient Implementations and Hardware Optimization\n\n### State Compression and Management\nEfficient state compression and management are critical for reducing the computational cost and improving the scalability of LM models. Techniques like state compression can help mitigate the bottleneck of matrix multiplication, which is a significant challenge in current LM designs. Integrating hyperbolic neural networks with efficient state management strategies could enhance the overall efficiency of the model.\n\n### Hardware-Optimized Attention\nTransformers, which are widely used in LM models, can benefit from hardware-optimized attention mechanisms. Since self-attention in transformers allows for parallel computation, optimizing this process for hardware can significantly improve training and inference efficiency. Hyperbolic neural networks, with their ability to process hierarchical structures efficiently, can be integrated into these optimized attention mechanisms to enhance performance on long sequences.\n\n## Recent Advances in Hyperbolic Neural Networks\n\n### Klein Model for Hyperbolic Neural Networks\nRecent work on the Klein model for hyperbolic neural networks provides a detailed formulation for representing useful geometric structures in hyperbolic space. This model can be particularly useful for tasks that require understanding complex hierarchical relationships, which is essential for improving the context length and efficiency of LM models.\n\n### Performance and Efficiency\nHyperbolic neural networks have been shown to outperform conventional networks in scenarios where data is sparse or hierarchically structured. They offer advantages such as error resilience, hierarchical representation, and efficiency in learning, which can be leveraged to improve the performance and efficiency of LM models, especially in handling long sequences and complex dependencies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo achieve the goal of improving autoregressive LM design, the following strategies can be considered:\n\n- **Integrate Hyperbolic Geometry**: Use hyperbolic neural networks to leverage their ability to represent hierarchical structures and capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: Implement hierarchy-aware attention mechanisms like those in the \"Coneheads\" approach to improve the handling of long sequences.\n- **State Compression and Management**: Develop efficient state compression and management techniques to reduce computational costs and improve scalability.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Optimize attention mechanisms for hardware to enhance parallel computation and improve training and inference efficiency.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

These networks rely heavily on the dot product attention operator, which computes the similarity between two points by taking their inner product. However, the inner product does not explicitly model the complex structural properties of real world datasets, such as hierarchies between data points. To remedy this, we introduce cone attention, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones. Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones, which intuitively measures the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it improves task-level performance over dot product attention and other baselines, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters. Our results suggest that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/31 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2103.02143, 2021.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.28)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/36 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nDavid Ha, Andrew Dai, and Quoc V Le. 2016.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/23 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1334-1345, 2018.

Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

Chen, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This synergistic framework L2ight is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.\n\n**Abstract:** Silicon-photonics-based optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient AI with its CMOS-compatibility, flexibility, ultra-low execution latency, and high energy efficiency. In-situ training on the online programmable photonic chips is appealing but still encounters challenging issues in on-chip implementability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework L2ight to enable scalable ONN mapping and efficient in-situ learning. L2ight adopts a three-stage learning flow that first calibrates the complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints, then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hyperbolic neural network implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using hyperbolic neural networks and ensure efficient implementation on modern hardware, here are some key techniques and strategies:\n\n## Efficient Hyperbolic Neural Network Implementation\n\n### Hyperbolic Geometry and Attention Mechanisms\n- Hyperbolic geometry is particularly useful for representing hierarchical structures, which is beneficial for modeling long-range dependencies in language models. Techniques like \"Cone attention\" can be used as a drop-in replacement for traditional dot product attention, offering strong performance with fewer parameters.\n- The \"Hypformer\" architecture, which processes data fully in hyperbolic space, includes a linear self-attention mechanism that is scalable and efficient for handling long-sequence inputs and large-scale graph data.\n\n### Optimized Hyperbolic Operations\n- Implementing hyperbolic operations efficiently is crucial. This can be achieved by leveraging the properties of hyperbolic spaces, such as exponential volume growth, which allows for embedding tree structures without distortion. Unified mathematical interpretations and stable performance compared to Euclidean counterparts can be found in works like \"Hyperbolic Neural Networks++\".\n\n### State Management and Compression\n- Effective state management in hyperbolic space is essential. Hyperbolic geometry can be used to compress states efficiently, which is particularly important for models that need to handle long sequences or large datasets. This can help in reducing the computational cost and improving the overall efficiency of the model.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n### Parallel Computation\n- Modern hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, can be optimized for parallel computation. Hyperbolic neural networks can be designed to take advantage of parallel processing, especially in the context of attention mechanisms and other computationally intensive operations. For instance, the \"Hypformer\" architecture is designed to process data in a way that leverages parallel computation efficiently.\n\n### Specialized Hardware Solutions\n- Utilizing specialized hardware solutions, such as those optimized for deep learning tasks, can significantly improve the performance of hyperbolic neural networks. For example, using GPUs for high-performance neural network hardware can reduce execution time and enhance the practical operation of these models.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Combining hyperbolic and Euclidean representations can offer a balanced approach between expressiveness and computational efficiency. Hybrid architectures can integrate hyperbolic attention mechanisms within existing frameworks, such as the TTT framework, to leverage the strengths of both geometric spaces.\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- Implementing linear attention mechanisms in hyperbolic space, as seen in the \"Hypformer\" architecture, can enable efficient processing of long sequences and large datasets. This approach can be particularly beneficial for autoregressive language models that need to handle sequential data efficiently.\n\n## Example Implementation\n\nHere is a simplified example of how one might implement hyperbolic embeddings using Python, which can be a starting point for integrating hyperbolic operations into an autoregressive language model:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom hyperbolic import HyperbolicEmbedding\n\n# Initialize hyperbolic embedding model\nmodel = HyperbolicEmbedding(dim=128)\n\n# Fit the model on your dataset\nmodel.fit(data)\n\n# Transform data into hyperbolic space\nhyperbolic_data = model.transform(data)\n```\n\nThis example illustrates the basic steps of using hyperbolic embeddings, which can be extended and integrated into more complex architectures like autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these techniques and strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of hyperbolic neural networks.\n",

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

In NVIDIA terms, GPU streaming multiprocessors launch thread blocks at the software level. These blocks are divided into warps (e.g. 32 threads) that are assigned to cores at the hardware level. Threads need to read inputs into their registers to perform computations and write the outputs. The time taken to read and write is referred to as the IO cost. Operations could either be memory or compute bound, depending on the time to load data vs. perform computations on loaded data. In designing our IO-aware algorithms, we would like to exploit two key properties of modern GPUs. First, tensor core units (fast matrix multiply units) achieve $312 \\mathrm{TFLOP} / \\mathrm{s}$ speeds relative to $19 \\mathrm{TFLOP} / \\mathrm{s}$ for the non-matrix multiply cores. Second, GPUs face a memory hierarchy with large amounts of slow-to-access memory and smaller amounts of fast-to-access memory. The access speed is governed by the proximitiy of the processor to the data address. For instance, the hierarchy on a modern NVIDIA 80GB A100 GPU is: 80 GB of HBM with $2 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth, 80 MB of L 2 cache, 192 KB of L1 cache / shared memory (implemented via SRAM) with $19 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth per SM, and 256 KB of register file per SM [33].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/72 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\neach token depends on every token before it in the sequence). Katharopoulos et al. [20, Choromanski et al. 21, Tsai et al. 32] show that we can select a feature map $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{d}}$ such that $\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right) \\approx \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$. We can then rewrite the formula for softmax attention in Equation (1) as\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\frac{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right) \\boldsymbol{v}_{j}}{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{j}\\right)}{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere every query attends to every past key in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{2}\\right)$ time and space complexity. Furthermore, Katharopoulos et al. 24] show that linear attention has a fixed size recurrent state during generation.

Feature map. To approximate $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$, we use the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor series feature map, picking $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)=1+\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}+\\frac{\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nWhile Zhang et al. 13 note that picking a feature map with $\\tilde{d}=d^{2}$ results in linear attention with $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity and large recurrent state of size $O\\left(d^{3}\\right)$, we can tradeoff efficiency for recall capacity by projecting queries and keys to smaller dimensions i.e., $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d^{\\prime}}$ with $d^{\\prime}=16$. By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/51 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n(2020), but the elementwise operations in the recurrent update cannot make use of tensor cores and result in low arithmetic intensity. Hence, while the recurrent form generally has the lowest total FLOPs among the three forms, this does not translate to actual wall-time efficiency. And while it is theoretically possible to parallelize linear recurrences via the parallel scan algorithm, this method requires materializing the 2D hidden state for each time step. This incurs a significant memory I/O burden, thereby offsetting the benefits of parallelism over the sequence length and resulting in slow actual running speeds, as in Katsch (2023). Parallel form. The parallel form could be as efficient as FlashAttention using similar I/O optimization techniques, as demonstrated by Qin et al. (2023b). However, the high number of FLOPs (due to the quadratic complexity) makes the long-sequence training expensive, the same issue that the na\u00efve implementation of softmax attention would suffer from. Chunkwise form. The chunkwise parallel form, which interpolates between the parallel and recurrent forms with an extra \"parameter\" $C$, makes it possible to more easily make the above tradeoffs for fine-grained optimization. Unlike the recurrent form, most operations can be done via matmuls, enabling the use of tensor cores (if $C$ is set to a multiple of 16). Though the chunkwise training algorithm has been discussed before in the literature (Hua et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023a), most implementations are not I/O-aware and thus slower than FlaShATtENTION for moderate sequence lengths (e.g., 2K-4K). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=622&width=663&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=257)\n\nFigure 1: (a) FLASHLINEARATTENTION without materialization. This version is more memory-efficient. (b-c) FlASHLINEARATTENTION with materialization. This version enables sequence-level chunkwise parallelism. ### 3.3 FlashLinearAttention: Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention with the Chunkwise Form\n\nWe describe our I/O-aware, hardware-efficient implementation of the chunkwise form. We give two versions, whose forward and backward passes differ depending on whether the chunk-level hidden states $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ are materialized in HBM. See Alg. 1 and Fig. 1 for the forward pass. (Alg. 2 in the appendix describes the backward pass.) At a high level, we use tiling to load tensors block-by-block and re-use tensor blocks on chip to avoid multiple HBM I/O as much as possible. For example, when $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ is loaded to SRAM, both $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{S}$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{K}_{[n]}^{\\top} \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_{[n]}$ can be computed on chip, which avoids loading $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ twice, thus saving HBM I/O. The non-materialization version computes $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ sequentially for $n \\in[N]$, using SRAM to temporarily store $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$, which is memory-efficient. This version parallelizes across batch size, number of heads, and head dimensions, but lacks sequence-level parallelim. When the batch size is large, this level of parallelism is sufficient to enable high GPU occupancy. In long-sequence and large scale training settings where batch size is small, the SMs cannot be fully exploited in this case. The materialization version first performs the inter-chunk recurrence (Eq. 2) and stores all $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ for $n \\in[N]$ in HBM. Then, the $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ 's can be computed in parallel for all chunks. This approach offers better parallelism but increases the memory footprint by approximately 10-20\\%. We mitigate this through recomputation, where the hidden states discarded after the forward pass and recomputed during the backward pass. We find this introduces a small runtime overhead but significantly reduces the memory footprint, and we adopt this strategy by default. Figure 2 shows the speed and memory footprint of our implementation. Both versions of FLASHLINEARATTENTION are substantially faster than FlASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=475&width=811&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2: Speed comparison on a single H100 GPU with batch size 32 , number of heads 16 , head dimension 64 , and chunk size 64.\n```\n\n#### 3. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

We draw the most direct connection to the literature of analyzing I/O complexity in this work [1], but concepts of memory hierarchies are fundamental and has appeared in many forms, from the working set model [21], to data locality [86], to the Roofline model of arithmetic intensity [85], to analyses of scalability [59], to standard textbook treatments of computer architecture [40]. We hope that this work encourages the community to adopt these ideas in more parts of the deep learning stack. Efficient ML Models with Structured Matrices. Matrix multiply is the core computational bottleneck of most machine learning models. To reduce the computational complexity, there have been numerous approaches to learn over a more efficient set of matrices. These matrices are called structured matrices, which have subquadratic ( $o\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ for dimension $n \\times n$ ) number of parameters and runtime. Most common examples of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices, along with fast transforms commonly encountered in signal processing (Fourier, Chebyshev, sine/cosine, orthogonal polynomials). There have been several more general classes of structured matrices proposed in machine learning: Toeplitz-like [78, low-displacement rank [49], quasi-separable [25]). The butterfly pattern we use for our block-sparse attention is motivated by the fact that butterfly matrices [15, 64] and their products have been shown to be able to express any structured matrices with almost optimal runtime and number of parameters 16, 20. However, even though structured matrices are efficient in theory, they have not seen wide adoption since it is hard to translate their efficiency to wall-clock speedup since dense unconstrained matrix multiply has very optimize implementation, a phenomenon known as the hardware lottery [41]. Extensions of butterfly matrices [17, 18] aimed to make butterfly matrices more hardware-friendly. Sparse Training. Our block-sparse FlashAttention can be seen as a step towards making sparse model training more efficient. Sparse models have seen success in compressing models for inference (pruning) by sparsifying the weight matrices [23, 38, 39, 55, 76. For model training, the lottery tickets hypothesis [28, 29, 30] suggests that there are a set of small sub-networks derived from a larger dense network that performs as well as the original dense network. Out block-sparse FlashAttention can also be seen as a fixed lottery ticket in the context of attention: we fix the sparsity pattern to be the butterfly pattern through training, and observe that it performs almost as well as the (dense) FlashAttention on the Long-range Arena tasks. Efficient Transformer. Transformer-based models have become the most widely-used architecture in natural language processing [22] and computer vision [24, 91]. However, one of their computational bottlenecks is that their time and memory scales quadratic in the sequence length. There are numerous approaches to overcome this bottleneck, including approximation with hashing (i.e., sparse) such as Reformer 51 and Smyrf [19] and with low-rank approximation such as Performer [12, 54. One can even combine sparse and low-rank approximation for better accuracy (e.g., Longformer [3, BigBird 92, Scatterbrain 9], Long-short transformer [94], Combiner [73]). Other approaches include compressing along the sequence dimension to attend to multiple tokens at once [52, 57, 79, 89]. One can also attend over the states from previous sequences to help lengthen the context (e.g., Transformer-XL 14 and Compressive Transformer 69]). We recommend the survey 81 for more details. There are several lines of work on developing other modules instead of attention to model longer context. HiPPO [35] and its extensions, most notably S4 [31, 36, 37] projects the history on a polynomial basis, allowing accurate reconstruction of the history through state-space models. They combine the strengths of CNNs (efficient training), RNNs (efficient inference), and continuous models (robust to change in sampling rates). LambdaNetworks [2], AFT [93] and FLASH 42] are other attempts at replacing attention in the context of image classification and language modeling. ## B Algorithm Details\n\nWe first derive the forward and backward passes of attention and show that they can be computed in a memory-efficient manner (requiring extra memory linear instead of quadratic in the sequence length). Though they reduce the amount of extra memory required, naively they still incur quadratic HBM accesses, resulting in slower execution speed. We describe the FlashAtTEntion algorithm to implement both the forward\nand the backward passes on GPUs that reduces HBM accesses, leading to both faster runtime and smaller memory footprint. ## B. 1 Memory-efficient forward pass\n\nThe main challenge in making attention memory-efficient is the softmax that couples the columns of $\\mathbf{K}$ (and columns of $\\mathbf{V}$ ). Our approach is to compute the softmax normalization constant separately to decouple the columns. This technique [60] has been used in the literature [51, 66] to show that attention computation does not need quadratic extra memory (though the number of HBM accesses is still quadratic, resulting in slow run-time). For simplicity, we omit here the max-shifting step during softmax. The full algorithm in Appendix B. 3 contains all the steps. Recall that given input sequences $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, we want to compute the attention output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\quad \\mathbf{P}=\\operatorname{softmax}(\\mathbf{S}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\quad \\mathbf{O}=\\mathbf{P V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}\n$$\n\nWe have that $S_{i j}=q_{i}^{T} k_{j}$ where $q_{i}$ and $k_{j}$ are the $i$-th and $j$-th columns of $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$ respectively. Define the normalization constants of softmax:\n\n$$\nL_{i}=\\sum_{j} e^{q_{i}^{T} k_{j}}\n$$\n\nLet $v_{j}$ be the $j$-th column of $\\mathbf{V}$, then the $i$-th columns of the output is\n\n$$\no_{i}=P_{i:} \\mathbf{V}=\\sum_{j} P_{i j} v_{j}=\\sum_{j} \\frac{e^{q_{i}^{T} k_{j}}}{L_{i}} v_{j}\n$$\n\nWe see that once $L_{i}$ is computed, we can compute $o_{i}$ without extra memory by repeatedly summing $\\frac{q^{q_{i}^{T} k_{j}}}{L_{i}} v_{j}$.\n```\n\n#### 4. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Latency-Aware CNN Depth Compression via Two-Stage Dynamic Programming\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hyperbolic operations memory optimization*\n\n*Jinuk Kim, Yeonwoo Jeong, Deokjae Lee, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** A subset selection problem that replaces inefficient activation layers with identity functions and optimally merges consecutive convolution operations into shallow equivalent Convolution operations for efficient end-to-end inference latency is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works on neural network pruning advocate that reducing the depth of the network is more effective in reducing run-time memory usage and accelerating inference latency than reducing the width of the network through channel pruning. In this regard, some recent works propose depth compression algorithms that merge convolution layers. However, the existing algorithms have a constricted search space and rely on human-engineered heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel depth compression algorithm which targets general convolution operations. We propose a subset selection problem that replaces inefficient activation layers with identity functions and optimally merges consecutive convolution operations into shallow equivalent convolution operations for efficient end-to-end inference latency. Since the proposed subset selection problem is NP-hard, we formulate a surrogate optimization problem that can be solved exactly via two-stage dynamic programming within a few seconds. We evaluate our methods and baselines by TensorRT for a fair inference latency comparison. Our method outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster inference speed in MobileNetV2 on the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, we achieve $1.41\\times$ speed-up with $0.11$\\%p accuracy gain in MobileNetV2-1.0 on the ImageNet.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively.

ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hyperbolic operations memory optimization*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on efficient hyperbolic operations, memory optimization, and computational efficiency, here are some key insights and techniques:\n\n## Efficient Hyperbolic Operations\n\n### Hyperbolic Adapters and Geometries\nUsing hyperbolic adapters on an Euclidean foundation model can leverage the benefits of both geometries.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*L.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression.

While state-of-the-art (SoTA) compression methods boast impressive advancements in preserving benign task performance, the potential risks of compression in terms of safety and trustworthiness have been largely neglected. This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of three (3) leading LLMs using five (5) SoTA compression techniques across eight (8) trustworthiness dimensions. Our experiments highlight the intricate interplay between compression and trustworthiness, revealing some interesting patterns. We find that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. For instance, a 4-bit quantized model retains the trustworthiness of its original counterpart, but model pruning significantly degrades trustworthiness, even at 50% sparsity. Moreover, employing quantization within a moderate bit range could unexpectedly improve certain trustworthiness dimensions such as ethics and fairness. Conversely, extreme quantization to very low bit levels (3 bits) tends to reduce trustworthiness significantly. This increased risk cannot be uncovered by looking at benign performance alone, in turn, mandating comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation in practice. These findings culminate in practical recommendations for simultaneously achieving high utility, efficiency, and trustworthiness in LLMs. Code and models are available at https://decoding-comp-trust.github.io.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

We obtain novel methods supporting bidirectional compression (both from the server to the workers and vice versa) that enjoy new state-of-the-art theoretical communication complexity for convex and nonconvex problems. Our bounds are the first that manage to decouple the variance/error coming from the workers-to-server and server-to-workers compression, transforming a multiplicative dependence to an additive one. Moreover, in the convex regime, we obtain the first bounds that match the theoretical communication complexity of gradient descent. Even in this convex regime, our algorithms work with biased gradient estimators, which is non-standard and requires new proof techniques that may be of independent interest.

Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144.

However, industry adoption usually requires the maximum throughput to comply with certain latency constraints that prevents Transformer models from being used in production. To address this gap, model compression techniques such as quantization and pruning may be used to improve inference efficiency. However, these compression techniques require specialized software to apply and deploy at scale. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for creating and running Fast Transformer models on CPUs, utilizing hardware-aware pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization, and our own Transformer inference runtime engine with optimized kernels for sparse and quantized operators. We demonstrate the efficiency of our pipeline by creating a Fast DistilBERT model showing minimal accuracy loss on the question-answering SQuADv1.1 benchmark, and throughput results under typical production constraints and environments. Our results outperform existing state-of-the-art Neural Magic's DeepSparse runtime performance by up to 50% and up to 4.1x performance speedup over ONNX Runtime.

In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves QuIP's (Chee et al., 2023) incoherence processing by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector quantization to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses fine-tuning to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

This method identifies and prunes less important layers and replaces them with a lightweight network, which helps in mitigating performance loss. This approach not only reduces computation time and resource consumption but also preserves the performance of the original model better than other pruning methods.\n\n### Manifold Alignment Based Layer Merging\nAnother technique involves manifold alignment based layer merging, which offers a resource-efficient and performance-preserving model compression method. This method aligns the layers of the model to reduce redundancy and merge them, resulting in a more compact model without significant performance degradation.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Implementations\n\n### Selective State Space Algorithms and Quadratic Self-Attention\nThe \"Cheems\" architecture combines selective state space algorithms with quadratic self-attention to create a more efficient and effective model. This architecture uses rotation position encoding and inner function attention to enhance state expressiveness and reduce memory usage. It also integrates a cross-domain mixture of experts to reduce parameter redundancy, making it more hardware-efficient.\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms and Memory Hierarchy Optimization\nIO-aware algorithms and memory hierarchy optimization are crucial for performance. Techniques like block-based processing, chunkwise processing, and efficient caching strategies can significantly improve throughput and reduce memory access overhead. For example, \"FlashAttention\" and \"ChunkAttention\" highlight the importance of IO-aware runtime optimization and memory hierarchy awareness to achieve efficient implementation.\n\n### Tensor Core Utilization and Matrix-Free Approaches\nUtilizing tensor cores and adopting matrix-free approaches can also enhance computational efficiency. These methods are particularly beneficial for hardware-specific optimizations, as they can leverage the capabilities of modern GPUs and other specialized hardware to speed up computations[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n## Memory Efficiency\n\n### Block-Based Processing and Adaptive State Compression\nBlock-based processing with careful sizing and adaptive state compression can improve memory efficiency. This involves breaking down monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into auxiliary prefix trees, which can enhance memory utilization and reduce the need for large memory allocations[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n### Efficient Caching Strategies\nEfficient caching strategies are essential for state management. Techniques such as prefix-aware KV cache and two-phase partitioning can help in optimizing memory access patterns and reducing the memory footprint of the model.\n\n## Modular and Distributed Approaches\nConsidering a modular and distributed approach, where multiple smaller, highly specialized models work together, can also optimize hardware usage.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

Summary of Your Analysis\n\nThe **CompressedStateTTTLinear** proposal aims to enhance the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating **adaptive state compression**, **efficient memory management**, **block-based processing**, and **hardware-optimized operations**. These modifications are designed to improve the model's **computational efficiency**, **scalability**, and **memory utilization** while maintaining or enhancing its **expressiveness** and **test-time training capabilities**.\n\nAfter conducting three rounds of comprehensive searches, the following insights have been gathered:\n\n- **Novelty of Integration**: There is limited existing research that directly combines **Gated Linear Attention (GAU)** with the **RWKV architecture** using **adaptive state compression** and **block-based processing**. Most existing works, such as **Mamba**, **RRWKV**, and **Eagle and Finch**, explore integrations of GAUs with other architectures or introduce enhancements to RWKV separately. This indicates that the proposed integration retains a high degree of novelty.\n\n- **Impact on Performance Metrics**:\n  - **Accuracy and Robustness**: Integrating adaptive state compression has the potential to maintain or even enhance model accuracy by efficiently managing memory and focusing computational resources on more informative parts of the input. However, empirical validation is necessary to confirm these benefits.\n  - **Efficiency and Scalability**: Techniques like **Selective State Spaces (SSMs)**, **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)**, and **hardware-efficient mechanisms** have demonstrated significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Incorporating similar strategies can lead to reduced memory footprint and faster inference times.\n  \n- **Implementation Feasibility**: \n  - Existing models like **Mamba** and **GoldFinch** provide valuable frameworks for integrating GAUs with SSMs and managing KV-Caches efficiently. Leveraging insights from these models can guide the practical implementation of the proposed enhancements.\n  - **Block-Based Processing** and **hardware optimizations** have been shown to effectively manage memory and computational resources, though careful consideration is required to handle potential complexity in state synchronization and boundary conditions.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**: The proposal aligns well with ongoing trends in developing **efficient attention mechanisms**, **adaptive computation**, and **scalable memory management** in autoregressive models. The focus on maintaining expressiveness while enhancing efficiency is consistent with the broader objectives in the field.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/43 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nA model architecture that stacks multiple LSTM modules together. - SHA-LSTM (Merity, 2019).

[2014] are designed to handle sequential data by incorporating a mechanism that enables information to propagate from one step to the next. This process can be succinctly expressed using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=g\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\tilde{x}_{t}=f\\left(x_{t}, h_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, the functions $g$ and $f$ refer to the reset gate and update gate, respectively. The reset gate function, $g$, determines the extent to which the previous state, $h_{t-1}$, is reset or forgotten based on the current input, $x_{t}$. Subsequently, the update gate function, $f$, governs the proportion of the current input $x_{t}$ and the hidden current state $h_{t}$ that contribute to the computation of the output, $\\tilde{x}_{t}$. By utilizing these reset and update gates, RNNs effectively capture the temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. ### 2.2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Model\n\nReceptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023] model captures and propagates information in a sequential or auto-regressive mode Graves [2014] as integrating the capabilities of RNNs and attention mechanisms. This model consists of two core blocks, namely the time-mix block and the channel-mix block. Time-Mix Block This block aims to enhance the modeling of dependencies and patterns within a sequence by replacing the conventional weighted sum calculation in attention mechanisms with hidden states. By incorporating hidden states, the time-mix block can effectively propagate and update information across sequential steps. The calculations involved in this block can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{q} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{q}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{q} \\\\\nk_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{k} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{k}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{k} \\\\\nv_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{v} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{v}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{v} \\\\\no_{t} & =\\left(\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)\\right) \\cdot W_{o}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn these formulas, the representations of $q_{t}, k_{t}$, and $v_{t}$ are calculated by linearly interpolating between the current input and the input at the previous time for coherent and fluent token representations. The parameter $\\mu$ denotes the token shift, which determines the interpolation weight. Similar to tensor-product attention, this block applies a non-linear activation function $\\sigma$ to $q_{t}$ and combines it with the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ using element-wise multiplication as an update gate. Furthermore, the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ serve as both the reset gate and a replacement for the traditional weighted sum value. This process of calculating the hidden states can be described by the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0}, p_{0} & =0,0,0 \\\\\np_{t} & =\\max \\left(p_{t-1}, k_{t}\\right) \\\\\nh_{t} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot a_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot v_{t}}{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot b_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the position biases are omitted in these equations for convenience, and the division is element-wise division. Intuitively, the hidden states are computed recursively, and the vector $p$ serves as the reset gate in this process. Channel-Mix Block This block is to amplify the outputs of time-mix block, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{r} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{r}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{r} \\\\\nz_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{z} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{z}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{z} \\\\\n\\tilde{x}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(r_{t}\\right) \\odot\\left(\\max \\left(z_{t}, 0\\right)^{2} \\cdot W_{v}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere squared ReLU activation So et al. [2022] is adopted. In these equations, the output $o_{t}$ contains the history information up to time $t$, and the interpolation weight $\\mu$ is derived from both $o_{t}$ and $o_{t-1}$ same as in time-mix block. Intuitively, this amplification process enhances the representations of historical information. In sum, the RWKV model has achieved the parallelization in a time-parallel mode due to the tensor-product Lei et al. [2018] and contains the linear computational costs for discarding similarity matrix.\n```\n\n#### 4. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive state compression autoregressive models\" \"Efficient memory management GAU\" \"Gated Linear Attention RWKV\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive state compression autoregressive models\" \"Efficient memory management GAU\" \"Gated Linear Attention RWKV\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations\nof linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention\nimplementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that\nenable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when\ngenerating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive state compression autoregressive models\" \"Efficient memory management GAU\" \"Gated Linear Attention RWKV\"*\n\n*Yu Zhang, Songlin Yang, Ruijie Zhu, Yue Zhang, Leyang Cui, Yiqiao Wang, Bolun Wang, Freda Shi, Bailin Wang, Wei Bi, Peng Zhou, Guohong Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for\nenabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short\nin recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand\nsignificant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated\nSlot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control\n(ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention\n(GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing\ncontext-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity\nwhile maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances\nboth training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient\ntraining algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax\noperation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to\nRNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch.\nExtensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring\nin-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11T09:49:50Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-11T09:49:50Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) with adaptive state compression, efficient memory management, block-based processing, and hardware-optimized operations, here are some key insights and directions based on the provided information and search keywords:\n\n## Novelty of Integration\n\n- **Existing Research**: There is a need to search for papers that have integrated adaptive state compression with autoregressive models, particularly those using Gated Linear Attention and the RWKV architecture.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks. The Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model offers a novel approach to combining the efficiency of Transformers with the scalability and performance of RNNs, allowing parallelization and scalability during training while maintaining constant computational and memory complexity during inference. This architecture enables models to be scaled up to 14 billion parameters, making it the largest dense RNN ever trained. RWKV demonstrates comparable performance to Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture for more efficient models in NLP tasks. Please further summarize it in one sentence. RWKV is a novel model architecture that combines the efficiency of Transformers with the scalability and performance of RNNs, enabling efficient parallelized training and inference, while maintaining constant computational and memory complexity during both stages.\n```\n\n#### 3.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 2 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated Linear Attention RWKV integration\" \"Adaptive state compression autoregressive models\" \"Efficient block-based processing GAU\", \"Gated Linear Attention RWKV integration\" \"Adaptive state compression autoregressive models\" \"Efficient block-based processing GAU\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Our cache size savings\nincrease linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller\nthan the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of\nextremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although\nautoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of\nattention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a\nsubmitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) to generate this cache.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training.
