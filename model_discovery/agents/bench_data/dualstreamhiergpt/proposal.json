Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.59)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n#### 3. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

An Adaptive Empirical Bayesian Method for Sparse Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Wei Deng, Xiao Zhang, F.

The proposed method works by alternatively sampling from an adaptive hierarchical posterior distribution using stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and smoothly optimizing the hyperparameters using stochastic approximation (SA). We further prove the convergence of the proposed method to the asymptotically correct distribution under mild conditions. Empirical applications of the proposed method lead to the state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and Fashion MNIST with shallow convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the state-of-the-art compression performance on CIFAR10 with Residual Networks.

SLAMB: Accelerated Large Batch Training with Sparse Communication\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Hang Xu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiawei Fei, Yuzhe Wu, Tingwen Xie, Jun Huang, Yuchen Xie, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Panos Kalnis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper combines sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB) to propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed training of large deep neural networks requires frequent exchange of massive data be-tween machines, thus communication efficiency is a major concern. Existing compressed communication methods are either not compatible with large batch optimization algorithms, or do not provide sufficient speedup in large scale. In this paper, we combine sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB). We propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs. SLAMB employs momentum masking, local error compensation, and element-wise adaptive rescaling to achieve accurate layer-wise weight updates, which translates to fast convergence for very large batches. Our empirical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, SLAMB transmits half the amount of data in large-batch BERT pre-training, without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, SLAMB achieves excellent scalability in large computing infrastructures. For instance, SLAMB with 128 GPUs reduces the training time of Swin Transformer pre-training on ImageNet to 5.35 hours, which is 2 hours faster than the state-of-the-art. At the extreme, we trained BERT-XL (2.8B parameters) on 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, where SLAMB achieved 90% scaling efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Ziming Wang, Runhao Jiang, S. Lian, Rui Yan, Huajin Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise, in this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is pro-hibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation degree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Jungmin Kwon, Jeongseop Kim, Hyunseong Park, I. Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), is suggested utilizing the proposed generalization bound, and experimental results show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound.

ContextNet: Exploring Context and Detail for Semantic Segmentation in Real-time\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Rudra P. K. Poudel, Christopher Zach, Ujwal Bonde, Stephan Liwicki*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep learning architectures produce highly accurate results on many\nchallenging semantic segmentation datasets. State-of-the-art methods are,\nhowever, not directly transferable to real-time applications or embedded\ndevices, since naive adaptation of such systems to reduce computational cost\n(speed, memory and energy) causes a significant drop in accuracy. We propose\nContextNet, a new deep neural network architecture which builds on factorized\nconvolution, network compression and pyramid representation to produce\ncompetitive semantic segmentation in real-time with low memory requirement.\nContextNet combines a deep network branch at low resolution that captures\nglobal context information efficiently with a shallow branch that focuses on\nhigh-resolution segmentation details. We analyse our network in a thorough\nablation study and present results on the Cityscapes dataset, achieving 66.1%\naccuracy at 18.3 frames per second at full (1024x2048) resolution (41.9 fps\nwith pipelined computations for streamed data).\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. How Well Do Sparse Imagenet Models Transfer?\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Mark Kurtz, Alexandra Peste, Eugenia Iofinova*\n\n**Abstract:** Transfer learning is a classic paradigm by which models pretrained on large \"upstream\" datasets are adapted to yield good results on \"downstream\" specialized datasets. Generally, more accurate models on the \"upstream\" dataset tend to provide better transfer accuracy \"downstream\". In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation of this phenomenon in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the ImageNet dataset, which have been pruned - that is, compressed by sparsifying their connections. We consider transfer using unstructured pruned models obtained by applying several state-of-the-art pruning methods, including magnitude-based, second-order, re-growth, lottery-ticket, and regularization approaches, in the context of twelve standard transfer tasks. In a nutshell, our study shows that sparse models can match or even outperform the transfer performance of dense models, even at high sparsities, and, while doing so, can lead to significant inference and even training speedups. At the same time, we observe and analyze significant differences in the behaviour of different pruning methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Winning Hand: Compressing Deep Networks Can Improve Out-Of-Distribution Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Bhavya Kailkhura, Jize Zhang, Shreya Chaganti, Brian R. Bartoldson, James Diffenderfer*\n\n**Abstract:** Successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in the wild requires models to be: (1) compact, (2) accurate, and (3) robust to distributional shifts. Unfortunately, efforts towards simultaneously meeting these requirements have mostly been unsuccessful. This raises an important question: Is the inability to create Compact, Accurate, and Robust Deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental? To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of popular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" approaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight CARDs. Specifically, we are able to create extremely compact CARDs that, compared to their larger counterparts, have similar test accuracy and matching (or better) robustness -- simply by pruning and (optionally) quantizing. Leveraging the compactness of CARDs, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling approach (CARD-Decks) that uses a gating module to dynamically select appropriate CARDs from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with test samples. The proposed approach builds a \"winning hand'' of CARDs that establishes a new state-of-the-art (on RobustBench) on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% standard and 92.75% robust) and CIFAR-100-C accuracies (80.6% standard and 71.3% robust) with better memory usage than non-compressed baselines (pretrained CARDs and CARD-Decks available at https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench). Finally, we provide theoretical support for our empirical findings.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on adaptive state compression and integration with normalization layers, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Adaptive Pruning and Compression\n\nThe concept of adaptive pruning can be highly relevant for state compression in neural networks. Here are a few methods that could be adapted:\n\n- **Developmental Plasticity-inspired Adaptive Pruning (DPAP):** This method, inspired by the brain's developmental plasticity, dynamically prunes inactive synapses and neurons based on their activity levels. It integrates multi-scale spatio-temporal developmental plasticity and can be applied to both DNNs and SNNs. This approach could be adapted to compress states in autoregressive models by pruning redundant or less active components, thus reducing memory and computational requirements.\n\n- **Bayesian Model Compression:** This involves using Bayesian principles to prune parameters in neural networks. By calculating the posterior inclusion probability for each node, this method can systematically remove parameters while maintaining accuracy. This could be integrated into the state management of autoregressive models to adaptively compress states based on their relevance.\n\n## Integration with Normalization Layers\n\nNormalization layers are crucial for stabilizing the training process and improving the performance of deep neural networks. Here are some ways to integrate adaptive state compression with normalization layers:\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing with Adaptive Normalization:** Building on the idea of hierarchical processing, normalization layers can be adapted to handle varying sequence lengths efficiently. For example, using a hierarchical RMSNorm component that adapts its parameters based on the data characteristics and sequence lengths can improve efficiency. This can be combined with adaptive pruning methods to dynamically adjust the normalization parameters based on the compressed state[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Dynamic State Compression with Control Theory Principles:** State Space Models (SSMs) can be used to create efficient sequence modeling frameworks. By integrating control theory principles, SSMs can dynamically compress and manage states, which can be further optimized with adaptive normalization techniques. This approach ensures that the model maintains constant speed across different sequence lengths while efficiently handling context comprehension[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\nFor hardware-efficient implementations, consider the following:\n\n- **Block-Based Processing:** Techniques like Lightning Attention, which split attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks, can maintain constant training speed and fixed memory consumption. This block-based processing can be combined with adaptive state compression to ensure efficient use of hardware resources[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Attention Transition Techniques:** These techniques involve sequentially eliminating and adding attention weights on different regions, which can improve context handling and reduce memory consumption. Integrating these techniques with adaptive state compression can enhance the overall efficiency of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Synthetic Attention Weights:** Using random or synthetic attention weights, as proposed in the Synthesizer model, can reduce the need for token-token interactions and thus simplify the state management. This can be combined with adaptive state compression to further optimize the model's performance and efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Implementations:** Ensuring that the model design is hardware-aware is crucial for performance. Techniques such as reducing FLOPs (as seen in image compression methods) can be adapted to optimize the computational efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model block that efficiently compresses states, adapts to varying sequence lengths, and maintains high performance while being hardware-efficient.\n",

In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give a \\textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/32 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\n(2018); Chen et al. (2019); Tu et al. (2019) proved norm-based generalization bounds, improving the VC dimension-based bounds by the Rademacher complexity technique (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002) under the uniform-convergence framework. In the overparameterization settings, it was\nshown in Allen-Zhu and Li (2019) that RNNs can learn some concept class in polynomial time given that the model size is large enough. These generalization bounds, however, do not take into account the temporal dependencies and their effects on generalization. In this work, we provide a new generalization bound by combining the memory structure of the model and the temporal structure of the data. Temporal structure analysis on RNNs. Sequence data has long-range temporal dependencies across the time domain, which notably set it apart from non-sequence data. Recent studies have studied the effects of such temporal dependencies on the approximation and optimization of RNNs. For example, in the two works of Li et al. (2021; 2022), a \"curse of memory\" phenomenon was discovered when using linear RNNs to model the temporal input-output relationships. Particularly, when the target relationship between the input and output has a long-term memory, then both approximation and optimization become extremely challenging. In Wang et al. (2023), the \"curse of memory\" phenomenon on approximation and optimization was extended to non-linear RNNs based on the temporal relationships. In this paper, we conduct a finegrained analysis on the effects of the temporal structure analysis on the generalization of RNNs. Optimization of SSMs. RNN optimization is known for two issues: training stability and computational cost (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013). To address these issues and capture the long dependencies efficiently in sequence modeling, the S4 model was proposed by new paraemterization, initialization and discretization (Gu et al., 2022a). Recent variants for the S4 model simplified the hidden state matrix by a diagonal matrix to enhance computational efficiency (Gu et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023). Regularization methods are also applied for SSMs to prevent overfitting, such as dropout, weight decay and the data continuity regularizer ( Qu et al., 2023). However, the principled way to regularize and initialize the parameters still remains to be explored. In this study, we design a new regularization and initialization scheme to improve both optimization and generalization. ## 3 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we briefly introduce the SSM in Section 3.1 and the motivation for optimization designs based on the generalization analysis in Section 3.2. ### 3.1 Introduction to SSMs\n\nIn this paper, we consider the following single-input single-output SSM,\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t), \\quad y(t)=C h(t), \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the input from an input space ${ }^{1} \\mathcal{X}:=C_{0}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{R}\\right) ; y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the output at time $t ; h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the hidden state with $h(0)=0 ; A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times m}$ are trainable parameters. Then (1) has an explicit solution $y(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} \\rho_{\\theta}(s) x(t-s) d s$, where $\\rho_{\\theta}(s):=C e^{A s} B$ with $\\theta=(C, A, B)$. The function $\\rho_{\\theta}(s)$ captures the memory structure of the model and the temporal input-output relationship (Li et al., 2022). For the S4 model and its variants (Gu et al., 2022a;b; Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023), (1) is usually discretized by the Zero-Order Hold method, i.e., given a timescale $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}, h_{k+1}=$ $\\bar{A} h_{k}+\\bar{B} x_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\bar{C} h_{k}, \\quad k=0,1, \\ldots$, where $\\bar{A}=e^{\\Delta \\cdot A}, \\bar{B}=\\left(\\bar{A}-\\mathbb{I}_{m}\\right) A^{-1} B, \\bar{C}=C$. Then, $y_{k}=\\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B} x_{0}+\\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-1} \\bar{B} x_{1}+\\ldots+\\bar{C} \\bar{B} x_{k}=[\\bar{K} * x]_{k}$ where $\\bar{K}=\\left(\\bar{C} \\bar{B}, \\bar{C} \\bar{A} \\bar{B}, \\ldots, \\bar{C} \\bar{A}{ }^{k} \\bar{B}\\right)$ and $*$ represents to convolution.

This example then motivates us to extend the connection to SSMs on sequential data. Linear regression. We consider a simple linear model $y=\\theta^{\\top} x$ with input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, output $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and parameter $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let the training data $\\left\\{\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be i.i.d. sampled from a distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ such that $\\left\\|x_{i}\\right\\|_{2}=r,\\left|y_{i}\\right| \\leq 1(\\forall i \\in[1: n])$. Define the empirical risk $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta):=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}-y_{i}\\right)^{2}$ and the population risk $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta):=\\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\\left[\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x-y\\right)^{2}\\right]$. Then given a norm-constrained space $\\Theta:=\\left\\{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}:\\|\\theta\\|_{2} \\leq\\right.$ $R\\}$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$ over $\\mathcal{D}$,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta)-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta)\\right| \\leq(r R+1)^{2} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log (1 / \\delta) / n})\n$$\n\nThis is a well-known norm-based generalization bound based on the Rademacher theory (Mohri et al., 2012), and we provide a proof in Appendix B for completeness. Notice that the key term $r^{2} R^{2}$ in the generalization bound (2) is also an upper bound for the magnitude of the linear model output, i.e., $\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}\\right)^{2} \\leq r^{2} R^{2}$. Thus, we connect the model stability with the generalization bound stability, and this connection induces an initialization scheme for the initialization $\\theta^{(0)}$ by setting $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1 / r)$. In particular, if we normalize each input $x_{i}$ such that $r$ is also $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, then $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$. Since $\\theta^{(0)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, one possible initialization scheme is that $\\theta^{(0)}$ follows a Uniform distribution $U[-1 / \\sqrt{d}, 1 / \\sqrt{d}]$, which corresponds to the Kaiming initialization (up to some constant) (He et al., 2015). When treating the term $r^{2} R^{2}$ as a regularizer to improve the generalization, we get the weight decay method, i.e., the $\\ell_{2}$ regularization w.r.t.\n```\n\n#### 2. Physics-Guided State-Space Model Augmentation Using Weighted Regularized Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Yuhan Liu, Roland T'oth, M. Schoukens*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN), which can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/14 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nSchoukens, M. (2021).

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$.

In the following, the strategies proposed in recent literature to address these problems are discussed. ## 3. DISCRETE-TIME SSL PARAMETRIZATIONS\n\n### 3.1 Discrete-time diagonal parametrization\n\nOne intuitive approach is that of parametrizing the SSL as a discrete-time complex-valued diagonal system, as proposed by Orvieto et al. (2023). In particular, $\\tilde{A}$ can be parametrized as a Schur-stable diagonal matrix\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}=\\tilde{\\Lambda}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{n_{\\lambda}}\\right)\n$$\n\nEach eigenvalue $j \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, n_{\\lambda}\\right\\}$ is, in turn, parametrized by the modulus $-\\exp \\left(\\mu_{j}\\right) \\in(0,1)$ and the phase $\\exp \\left(\\theta_{j}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\exp \\left(-\\exp \\left(\\mu_{j}\\right)+i \\exp \\left(\\theta_{j}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that since $\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|<1$ this parametrization guarantees that the SSM is structurally $\\delta$ ISS (Proposition 2). A\nrelevant design choice advocated by Orvieto et al. (2023) is that of reparametrizing $\\tilde{B}$ as\n\n$$\n\\tilde{B}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{n_{\\lambda}}\\right) \\check{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the normalization factor is defined as\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{j}=\\left(1-\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\quad \\forall j \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, n_{\\lambda}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThis ensures that the rows of $\\tilde{B}$ are normalized so that white noise inputs yield state trajectories with the same energy content as of the input. Therefore, the set of learnable parameters of this SSL parametrization reads\n\n$$\n\\Theta=\\left\\{\\left\\{\\mu_{j}, \\theta_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, n_{\\lambda}\\right\\}}, \\check{B}, \\tilde{C}, D, F\\right\\}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 Initialization strategy\n\nOrvieto et al.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/15 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nThis is done in order to facilitate the learning of dependencies across different time scales.

Robust Training of Neural Networks using Scale Invariant Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Zhiyuan Li, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, M. Zaheer, Sashank J. Reddi, Surinder Kumar*\n\n**TL;DR:** A scale invariant version of BERT is designed, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In contrast to SGD, adaptive gradient methods like Adam allow robust training of modern deep networks, especially large language models. However, the use of adaptivity not only comes at the cost of extra memory but also raises the fundamental question: can non-adaptive methods like SGD enjoy similar benefits? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by proposing to achieve both robust and memory-efficient training via the following general recipe: (1) modify the architecture and make it scale invariant, i.e. the scale of parameter doesn't affect the output of the network, (2) train with SGD and weight decay, and optionally (3) clip the global gradient norm proportional to weight norm multiplied by $\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2\\lambda}{\\eta}}$, where $\\eta$ is learning rate and $\\lambda$ is weight decay. We show that this general approach is robust to rescaling of parameter and loss by proving that its convergence only depends logarithmically on the scale of initialization and loss, whereas the standard SGD might not even converge for many initializations. Following our recipe, we design a scale invariant version of BERT, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), is suggested utilizing the proposed generalization bound, and experimental results show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 3. Initialization Matters: Privacy-Utility Analysis of Overparameterized Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Jiayuan Ye, Zhenyu Zhu, Fanghui Liu, R.

Cevher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proves a privacy bound for the KL divergence between model distributions on worst-case neighboring datasets, and explores its dependence on the initialization, width, and depth of fully connected neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** We analytically investigate how over-parameterization of models in randomized machine learning algorithms impacts the information leakage about their training data. Specifically, we prove a privacy bound for the KL divergence between model distributions on worst-case neighboring datasets, and explore its dependence on the initialization, width, and depth of fully connected neural networks. We find that this KL privacy bound is largely determined by the expected squared gradient norm relative to model parameters during training. Notably, for the special setting of linearized network, our analysis indicates that the squared gradient norm (and therefore the escalation of privacy loss) is tied directly to the per-layer variance of the initialization distribution. By using this analysis, we demonstrate that privacy bound improves with increasing depth under certain initializations (LeCun and Xavier), while degrades with increasing depth under other initializations (He and NTK). Our work reveals a complex interplay between privacy and depth that depends on the chosen initialization distribution. We further prove excess empirical risk bounds under a fixed KL privacy budget, and show that the interplay between privacy utility trade-off and depth is similarly affected by the initialization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive wavelet distillation from neural networks through interpretations\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Wooseok Ha, Chandan Singh, F. Lanusse, E. Song, Song Dang, Kangmin He, S. Upadhyayula, Bin Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adapt wavelet distillation (AWD) is proposed, a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform and yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency. Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the context of respective domains.

Distilling Long-tailed Datasets\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Yan Yan, Kai Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Haoxuan Wang, Zhenghao Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Dataset distillation (DD) aims to distill a small, information-rich dataset from a larger one for efficient neural network training. However, existing DD methods struggle with long-tailed datasets, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. By investigating the reasons behind this unexpected result, we identified two main causes: 1) Expert networks trained on imbalanced data develop biased gradients, leading to the synthesis of similarly imbalanced distilled datasets. Parameter matching, a common technique in DD, involves aligning the learning parameters of the distilled dataset with that of the original dataset. However, in the context of long-tailed datasets, matching biased experts leads to inheriting the imbalance present in the original data, causing the distilled dataset to inadequately represent tail classes. 2) The experts trained on such datasets perform suboptimally on tail classes, resulting in misguided distillation supervision and poor-quality soft-label initialization. To address these issues, we propose a novel long-tailed dataset distillation method, Long-tailed Aware Dataset distillation (LAD). Specifically, we propose Weight Mismatch Avoidance to avoid directly matching the biased expert trajectories. It reduces the distance between the student and the biased expert trajectories and prevents the tail class bias from being distilled to the synthetic dataset. Moreover, we propose Adaptive Decoupled Matching, which jointly matches the decoupled backbone and classifier to improve the tail class performance and initialize reliable soft labels. This work pioneers the field of long-tailed dataset distillation (LTDD), marking the first effective effort to distill long-tailed datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. Delta Tuning: A Comprehensive Study of Parameter Efficient Methods for Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Maosong Sun, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang, Yang Liu, Jianfei Chen, Hai-Tao Zheng, Zhiyuan Liu, Xiaozhi Wang, Weilin Zhao, Jing Yi, Weize Chen, Chi-Min Chan, Yulin Chen, Shengding Hu, Yusheng Su, Zonghan Yang, Fuchao Wei, Guang Yang, Yujia Qin, Ning Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the success, the process of fine-tuning large-scale PLMs brings prohibitive adaptation costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a colossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this paper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched, largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned parameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then comprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches. We also propose a unified categorization criterion that divide existing delta tuning methods into three groups: addition-based, specification-based, and reparameterization-based methods. Though initially proposed as an efficient method to steer large models, we believe that some of the fascinating evidence discovered along with delta tuning could help further reveal the mechanisms of PLMs and even deep neural networks. To this end, we discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta tuning and propose frameworks to interpret delta tuning from the perspective of optimization and optimal control, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study of representative methods, where results on over 100 NLP tasks demonstrate a comprehensive performance comparison of different approaches. The experimental results also cover the analysis of combinatorial, scaling and transferable properties of delta tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Bridging the Gap Between End-to-End and Two-Step Text Spotting\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter initialization neural networks*\n\n*Lianwen Jin, Xiang Bai, Yuliang Liu, Hongliang Li, Mingxin Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Modularity plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of complex systems. While end-to-end text spotting efficiently mitigates the issues of error accumulation and sub-optimal performance seen in traditional two-step methodologies, the two-step methods continue to be favored in many competitions and practical settings due to their superior modularity. In this paper, we introduce Bridging Text Spotting, a novel approach that resolves the error accumulation and suboptimal performance issues in two-step methods while retaining modularity. To achieve this, we adopt a well-trained detector and recognizer that are developed and trained independently and then lock their parameters to preserve their already acquired capabilities. Subsequently, we introduce a Bridge that connects the locked detector and recognizer through a zero-initialized neural network. This zero-initialized neural network, initialized with weights set to zeros, ensures seamless integration of the large receptive field features in detection into the locked recognizer. Furthermore, since the fixed detector and recognizer cannot naturally acquire end-to-end optimization features, we adopt the Adapter to facilitate their efficient learning of these features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments: Connecting the latest detector and recognizer through Bridging Text Spotting, we achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on Total-Text, 69.8% on CTW1500, and 89.5% on ICDAR 2015. The code is available at https://github.com/mxin262/Bridging-Text-Spotting.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive parameter initialization and techniques that enhance training stability and convergence, here are some key insights and methods from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Weight Initialization Techniques\n\n### Weight Scaling Initialization\nProper weight initialization is crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process. Weight scaling initialization techniques, such as those described by Glorot and Bengio (2010) and He et al. (2015), help maintain the variance of activations across layers, ensuring effective signal propagation. This approach can significantly improve training dynamics and model performance.\n\n### Spectral Properties and Initialization\nMaintaining the spectral properties of the initialization, such as keeping the singular values of the layerwise Jacobians close to one, is essential for trainability. Techniques like spectral regularization aim to sustain these properties during training, which can help in continual learning and improve the overall stability of the model.\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Initialization and Adjustment\n\n### Regularization Towards Initialization\nMethods that regularize the parameters towards their initial values can help in sustaining the key properties of the weights that ensure trainability. This approach involves using regularization techniques to keep the network parameters within a region that serves as a good initialization for subsequent tasks, which is particularly useful in continual learning scenarios.\n\n### Smart Initialization and Variance Reduction\nInitializing weights with lower variance can reduce the initial gradients and prevent the loss of information about the primary loss function during training. This approach, as seen in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), involves preprocessing procedures to decrease variance during initialization, leading to faster convergence and improved stability.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Adjustment\n\n### Adaptive Learning Rates\nUsing adaptive optimizers like Adam, which adjust the learning rate for each weight based on the first and second moments of the gradients, can help in dynamic parameter adjustment. This approach ensures that the learning rate is adapted based on the input characteristics, leading to more stable and efficient training.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nImplementing block-based processing, where the attention calculation is split into intra-blocks and inter-blocks, can allow for dynamic parameter adjustment based on sequence characteristics. This method can optimize memory usage and improve the efficiency of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration with Content-Based Reasoning\n\n### Selective State Propagation\nIntegrating content-based reasoning with state compression involves selective state propagation based on the relevance of the input content. This approach can be combined with adaptive parameter initialization to ensure that the model selectively propagates or forgets information along the sequence length dimension, enhancing its ability to adapt to different input characteristics[Analysis Note].\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n### Warm-Up Training\nUsing warm-up training phases, where the model is initially trained with a subset of data or specific conditions, can help the model adapt slowly to the data and compute correct statistics of the gradients. This approach can be particularly beneficial when combined with adaptive parameter initialization techniques.\n\nIn summary, to improve the autoregressive language model design, the following techniques can be considered:\n\n- **Weight scaling initialization** to maintain variance across layers.\n- **Spectral regularization** to sustain key properties of the weights.\n- **Regularization towards initialization** to ensure trainability in continual learning.\n- **Smart initialization with variance reduction** to improve convergence speed.\n- **Adaptive learning rates** and **block-based processing** for dynamic parameter adjustment.\n- **Selective state propagation** integrated with content-based reasoning to enhance adaptability.\n\nThese methods can help in achieving better training stability, convergence, and overall performance of the autoregressive language model.\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

A. ## 2 RELATEd WORK\n\nNeural network research has long sought architectures that can handle large, arbitrarily structured inputs and outputs. Autoencoding (Hinton \\& Zemel, 1994) was among the first attempts to build\nrepresentation which could encode and reproduce high-dimensional inputs like images. As hardware grew more powerful, neural nets led to breakthroughs in image understanding (Krizhevsky et al., 2012, Zeiler \\& Fergus, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015) and interest intensified: autoregressive models that could process and complete samples of handwriting were developed (Graves 2013), and new convolutional network designs led to good results in structured output spaces like semantic segmentation (Farabet et al., 2012, Long et al., 2015, Ronneberger et al., 2015), pose estimation (Toshev \\& Szegedy, 2014), detection (Sermanet et al., 2014), captioning (You et al., 2016), and optical flow (Fischer et al. 2015). At the same time, natural language applications research has made extensive progressive in capturing the structured nature of language, typically via autoregressive models (Collobert et al. 2011; Sutskever et al., 2014, Vaswani et al., 2017, Radford et al., 2019, Brown et al, 2020) or context prediction (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014, Devlin et al., 2019). Similar to our work, several groups have proposed to solve tasks in multiple domains (e.g. Kaiser et al. 2017, Alayrac et al. 2020; Akbari et al. 2021, but typically across a fixed and predefined set of modalities by means of domain-specific networks. Although single-task specialist networks remain dominant in vision, multi-task learning has become popular (Misra et al., 2016, Doersch \\& Zisserman, 2017, Kokkinos, 2017, Zamir et al., 2018) and individual models achieve generality in a restricted domain: e.g. Mask-RCNN (He et al., 2017) handles object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In language, training or evaluation on multiple tasks has also become common (Collobert \\& Weston, 2008, Luong et al., 2016, Devlin et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019, Raffel et al., 2020). Several groups have demonstrated that Transformers (originally designed for language) can be used or adapted to non-language tasks (e.g. Chen et al. 2020, Lu et al. 2021), but the limited scalability of Transformers limits their usefulness as general-purpose architectures. Several groups have proposed to use attention to manipulate the size of arrays or to introduce bottlenecks in processing. Set Transformers and related work (Lee et al., 2019, Goyal et al., 2022) use a learned query (\"inducing points\") to induce local bottlenecks by mapping a set back and forth from a set with fewer elements and learned decoder queries (\"seed vectors\") to map to outputs (\"pooling by multiheaded attention'). Each layer of these networks has complexity linear in the input size, while Perceivers use a deep latent network with complexity independent of the input and output. Our work uses attention over inputs and outputs of different sizes in part to produce an efficient attention architecture, and several other efficient attention architectures have been proposed, largely for language or small-scale problems (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Teodoro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers the hierarchical representation of documents as graphs as graphs and uses geometric deep learning to classify them into different categories and applies this model to classify clinical trial (CT) protocols into completed and terminated categories.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the hierarchical representation of documents as graphs and use geometric deep learning to classify them into different categories. While graph neural networks can efficiently handle the variable structure of hierarchical documents using the permutation invariant message passing operations, we show that we can gain extra performance improvements using our proposed selective graph pooling operation that arises from the fact that some parts of the hierarchy are invariable across different documents. We applied our model to classify clinical trial (CT) protocols into completed and terminated categories. We use bag-of-words based, as well as pre-trained transformer-based embeddings to featurize the graph nodes, achieving f1-scoresaround 0.85 on a publicly available large scale CT registry of around 360K protocols. We further demonstrate how the selective pooling can add insights into the CT termination status prediction.

However, there are several critical challenges in the training of PINNs, including the lack of theoretical frameworks and the imbalance between PDE loss and boundary loss. In this paper, we present an analysis of second-order non-homogeneous PDEs, which are classified into three categories and applicable to various common problems. We also characterize the connections between the training loss and actual error, guaranteeing convergence under mild conditions. The theoretical analysis inspires us to further propose MultiAdam, a scale-invariant optimizer that leverages gradient momentum to parameter-wisely balance the loss terms. Extensive experiment results on multiple problems from different physical domains demonstrate that our MultiAdam solver can improve the predictive accuracy by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared with strong baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Jungmin Kwon, Jeongseop Kim, Hyunseong Park, I. Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), is suggested utilizing the proposed generalization bound, and experimental results show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 5. Robust Training of Neural Networks using Scale Invariant Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Zhiyuan Li, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, M. Zaheer, Sashank J. Reddi, Surinder Kumar*\n\n**TL;DR:** A scale invariant version of BERT is designed, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In contrast to SGD, adaptive gradient methods like Adam allow robust training of modern deep networks, especially large language models. However, the use of adaptivity not only comes at the cost of extra memory but also raises the fundamental question: can non-adaptive methods like SGD enjoy similar benefits? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by proposing to achieve both robust and memory-efficient training via the following general recipe: (1) modify the architecture and make it scale invariant, i.e. the scale of parameter doesn't affect the output of the network, (2) train with SGD and weight decay, and optionally (3) clip the global gradient norm proportional to weight norm multiplied by $\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2\\lambda}{\\eta}}$, where $\\eta$ is learning rate and $\\lambda$ is weight decay. We show that this general approach is robust to rescaling of parameter and loss by proving that its convergence only depends logarithmically on the scale of initialization and loss, whereas the standard SGD might not even converge for many initializations. Following our recipe, we design a scale invariant version of BERT, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Robust Visual Tracking via Hierarchical Convolutional Features\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jia-Bin Huang, Chao Ma, Xiaokang Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose to exploit the rich hierarchical features of deep\nconvolutional neural networks to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual\ntracking. Deep neural networks trained on object recognition datasets consist\nof multiple convolutional layers. These layers encode target appearance with\ndifferent levels of abstraction. For example, the outputs of the last\nconvolutional layers encode the semantic information of targets and such\nrepresentations are invariant to significant appearance variations. However,\ntheir spatial resolutions are too coarse to precisely localize the target. In\ncontrast, features from earlier convolutional layers provide more precise\nlocalization but are less invariant to appearance changes. We interpret the\nhierarchical features of convolutional layers as a nonlinear counterpart of an\nimage pyramid representation and explicitly exploit these multiple levels of\nabstraction to represent target objects. Specifically, we learn adaptive\ncorrelation filters on the outputs from each convolutional layer to encode the\ntarget appearance. We infer the maximum response of each layer to locate\ntargets in a coarse-to-fine manner. To further handle the issues with scale\nestimation and re-detecting target objects from tracking failures caused by\nheavy occlusion or out-of-the-view movement, we conservatively learn another\ncorrelation filter, that maintains a long-term memory of target appearance, as\na discriminative classifier. We apply the classifier to two types of object\nproposals: (1) proposals with a small step size and tightly around the\nestimated location for scale estimation; and (2) proposals with large step size\nand across the whole image for target re-detection. Extensive experimental\nresults on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm\nperforms favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

Transform-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification and Search\n\n*From Search Query: scale invariant hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Shaoyan Sun, Anfeng He*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition tasks. However, current CNN models still exhibit a poor ability to be invariant to spatial transformations of images. Intuitively, with sufficient layers and parameters, hierarchical combinations of convolution (matrix multiplication and non-linear activation) and pooling operations should be able to learn a robust mapping from transformed input images to transform-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose randomly transforming (rotation, scale, and translation) feature maps of CNNs during the training stage. This prevents complex dependencies of specific rotation, scale, and translation levels of training images in CNN models. Rather, each convolutional kernel learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the transform-invariant answer given the combinatorially large variety of transform levels of its input feature maps. In this way, we do not require any extra training supervision or modification to the optimization process and training images. We show that random transformation provides significant improvements of CNNs on many benchmark tasks, including small-scale image recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval. The code is available at https://github.com/jasonustc/caffe-multigpu/tree/TICNN.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly by integrating scale-invariant architectures with hierarchical processing and adaptive compression techniques, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Scale-Invariant Architectures\n\n### Robust Training Using Scale Invariant Architectures\n- The concept of scale-invariant architectures can be applied to reduce the sensitivity of the model to parameter initialization. This can be achieved by modifying the architecture so that the scale of parameters does not affect the output of the network. For example, using normalization techniques that are scale-invariant, such as Layer Normalization or RMSNorm, can help in stabilizing the training process.\n\n### Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n- Adaptive sharpness-aware minimization introduces the concept of adaptive sharpness, which is scale-invariant. This approach can significantly improve the generalization performance of the model by balancing between sharpness and scale. Integrating this into hierarchical models can enhance their robustness and stability.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n- State Space Models (SSMs) can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering a hierarchical approach to processing sequences. SSMs can be designed to handle temporal dependencies efficiently, which is crucial for autoregressive language models. By using SSMs as foundation models, researchers can create synergies between sequence modeling and hierarchical processing.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\n- Implementing block-based processing with adaptive boundaries can improve memory utilization and efficiency. This involves dividing the input sequence into blocks and processing them hierarchically, which can be particularly useful for long-range dependencies in language models. Selective state propagation based on content relevance can further enhance this approach[Analysis Note].\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques\n\n### Memory-Efficient Compression\n- Adaptive compression techniques can be integrated into hierarchical models to maintain information while reducing memory usage. This can involve using techniques such as quantization, pruning, or sparse representations that adapt to the content of the input sequence. Control theory principles can guide the design of these compression methods to ensure they preserve critical information[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n- Using hierarchical attention mechanisms, such as those found in transformers, can help in selectively propagating relevant states and compressing less important information. For example, the STAR-Transformer and STEP CATFormer models use spatio-temporal cross attention and body-part cross attention, respectively, which can be adapted for text sequences to achieve similar hierarchical processing and compression benefits[GitHub Repository].\n\n## Integration of Control Theory\n\n### Control Theoretic Overview\n- Integrating control theory principles with normalization layers can provide a systematic approach to managing state space in hierarchical models. This involves designing the state space model in a way that is guided by control theory, ensuring stability and efficiency in the model's operation.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\n- Hardware-aware design is crucial for the performance of large-scale language models. Optimizing the memory hierarchy and parallel computation strategies can significantly impact the efficiency of the model. Techniques such as model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism can be optimized to fit the hardware constraints while maintaining the scale-invariant and hierarchical nature of the model[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop a comprehensive approach to improving autoregressive language model design, ensuring stability across different scales, efficient hierarchical processing, and adaptive compression. Here are some key references and concepts to explore further:\n\n- **Robust Training of Neural Networks using Scale Invariant Architectures**: This work provides insights into making architectures scale-invariant, which can be applied to autoregressive models.\n- **ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization**: This technique can enhance generalization performance and stability in hierarchical models.\n- **State Space Models as Foundation Models**: This overview provides a control theoretic perspective on designing state space models, which can be integrated into hierarchical sequence modeling.\n- **Hierarchical Contrastive Learning and Attention Mechanisms**: Techniques like hierarchical contrastive learning and attention mechanisms can be adapted from other domains (e.g., skeleton-based action recognition) to improve hierarchical processing in language models[GitHub Repository].\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe interplay between fast and slow mechanisms for information processing and perception has been studied in both cognitive science and machine learning Ba et al. (2016); Hinton \\& Plaut (1987). In the brain, short-term and long-term memory have developed in a specialized way. Short-term memory is allowed to change very quickly to react to immediate sensory inputs and perception. It also tends towards high capacity storage of all pieces of information which may be relevant for future reasoning Jonides et al. (2008); Atkinson \\& Shiffrin (1971); Averbach \\& Coriell (1961). By contrast, long-term memory changes slowly Kolodner (1983); Jeneson \\& Squire (2012), is highly selective and involves repeated consolidation. It contains a set of memories that summarize the entire past, only storing details about observations which are most relevant Goelet et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/46 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nLayers\n\\# R: Num. \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) per \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)\n\\# X: Input sequence of length T. shape: [B x T x D]\n\\# I: The Temporal Bottleneck\n\\# K: Chunk Size\nX = torch.chunk(X, K, dim = 1) \\# List of length \\(\\lfloor T / K\\rfloor\\) with each element\n    of size \\([B\\) x K x D]\nfor \\(X_{c}\\) in X:\n    for 1 in range(L):\n        \\(X_{c}=\\mathcal{S}^{l}\\left(X_{c}, \\quad X_{c}, \\quad X_{c}\\right)\\)\n        if \\(1 \\% \\mathrm{R}==0\\) :\n        \\(X_{c}=\\mathcal{C}^{\\lfloor L / l\\rfloor}\\left(X_{c}, \\quad \\mathcal{I}, \\quad \\mathcal{I}\\right)\\)\n    \\(\\mathcal{I}=\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{I}, \\quad X_{c}, \\quad X_{c}\\right)\\)\n```\n\n\n### 2.1 Desiderata for Fast and Slow Streams of Processing\n\nWe give the detailed description of the proposed model in the next section.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/51 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415, 2016.

A Dual-Stream Neural Network Explains the Functional Segregation of Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways in Human Brains\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream processing neural networks*\n\n*Minkyu Choi, Kuan Han, Xiaokai Wang, Yizhen Zhang, Zhongming Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is speculated that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** The human visual system uses two parallel pathways for spatial processing and object recognition. In contrast, computer vision systems tend to use a single feedforward pathway, rendering them less robust, adaptive, or efficient than human vision. To bridge this gap, we developed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human eyes and brain. At the input level, the model samples two complementary visual patterns to mimic how the human eyes use magnocellular and parvocellular retinal ganglion cells to separate retinal inputs to the brain. At the backend, the model processes the separate input patterns through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to mimic how the human brain uses the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways for parallel visual processing. The first branch (WhereCNN) samples a global view to learn spatial attention and control eye movements. The second branch (WhatCNN) samples a local view to represent the object around the fixation. Over time, the two branches interact recurrently to build a scene representation from moving fixations. We compared this model with the human brains processing the same movie and evaluated their functional alignment by linear transformation. The WhereCNN and WhatCNN branches were found to differentially match the dorsal and ventral pathways of the visual cortex, respectively, primarily due to their different learning objectives. These model-based results lead us to speculate that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs. This dual-stream model takes a further step in brain-inspired computer vision, enabling parallel neural networks to actively explore and understand the visual surroundings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Trash or Treasure? An Interactive Dual-Stream Strategy for Single Image Reflection Separation\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream processing neural networks*\n\n*Qiming Hu, Xiaojie Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a general yet simple interactive strategy, namely YTMT, namely $\\textit{your trash is my treasure}$ (YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks and explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely.\n\n**Abstract:** Single image reflection separation (SIRS), as a representative blind source separation task, aims to recover two layers, $\\textit{i.e.}$, transmission and reflection, from one mixed observation, which is challenging due to the highly ill-posed nature. Existing deep learning based solutions typically restore the target layers individually, or with some concerns at the end of the output, barely taking into account the interaction across the two streams/branches. In order to utilize information more efficiently, this work presents a general yet simple interactive strategy, namely $\\textit{your trash is my treasure}$ (YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks. To be specific, we explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely. Inspired by the additive property between the two components, the interactive path can be easily built via transferring, instead of discarding, deactivated information by the ReLU rectifier from one stream to the other. Both ablation studies and experimental results on widely-used SIRS datasets are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of YTMT, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art alternatives.

However, the computational overheads of fitting GNNs to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to GNNs from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in GNNs with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While GLT provides new insights for GNN compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in GLT utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective \u2013 transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. Compared to GLT, our proposal helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability. More importantly, we rigorously prove that our model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory.

Like neural network layers, these attention mechanisms are often developed by heuristics and experience. To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we present a generic Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) to fully explore the representation capacity of local and global pattern features for image classification. Our DS-Net can simultaneously calculate fine-grained and integrated features and efficiently fuse them. Specifically, we propose an Intra-scale Propagation module to process two different resolutions in each block and an Inter-Scale Alignment module to perform information interaction across features at dual scales. Besides, we also design a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) to further enhance contextual information for downstream dense predictions. Without bells and whistles, the propsed DS-Net outperforms Deit-Small by 2.4% in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k and achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets. For object detection and instance segmentation, DS-Net-Small respectively outperforms ResNet-50 by 6.4% and 5.5 % in terms of mAP on MSCOCO 2017, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art scheme, which significantly demonstrates its potential to be a general backbone in vision tasks.

Direction-Aware Adaptive Online Neural Speech Enhancement with an Augmented Reality Headset in Real Noisy Conversational Environments\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream processing neural networks*\n\n*Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Mathieu Fontaine, Yoshiaki Bando, Yicheng Du, Aditya Arie Nugraha, Kouhei Sekiguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes the practical response- and performance-aware development of online speech enhancement for an augmented reality (AR) headset that helps a user understand conversations made in real noisy echoic environments (e.g., cocktail party). One may use a state-of-the-art blind source separation method called fast multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (FastMNMF) that works well in various environments thanks to its unsupervised nature. Its heavy computational cost, however, prevents its application to real-time processing. In contrast, a supervised beamforming method that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for estimating spatial information of speech and noise readily fits real-time processing, but suffers from drastic performance degradation in mismatched conditions. Given such complementary characteristics, we propose a dual-process robust online speech enhancement method based on DNN-based beamforming with FastMNMF-guided adaptation. FastMNMF (back end) is performed in a mini-batch style and the noisy and enhanced speech pairs are used together with the original parallel training data for updating the direction-aware DNN (front end) with backpropagation at a computationally-allowable interval. This method is used with a blind dereverberation method called weighted prediction error (WPE) for transcribing the noisy reverberant speech of a speaker, which can be detected from video or selected by a user's hand gesture or eye gaze, in a streaming manner and spatially showing the transcriptions with an AR technique.

Gated Fusion Network for Degraded Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream processing neural networks*\n\n*Ming-Hsuan Yang, Wei-Sheng Lai, Fei Wang, Xinyi Zhang, Zhe Hu, Hang Dong*\n\n**Abstract:** Single image super resolution aims to enhance image quality with respect to spatial content, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. In this work, we address the task of single frame super resolution with the presence of image degradation, e.g., blur, haze, or rain streaks. Due to the limitations of frame capturing and formation processes, image degradation is inevitable, and the artifacts would be exacerbated by super resolution methods. To address this problem, we propose a dual-branch convolutional neural network to extract base features and recovered features separately. The base features contain local and global information of the input image. On the other hand, the recovered features focus on the degraded regions and are used to remove the degradation. Those features are then fused through a recursive gate module to obtain sharp features for super resolution. By decomposing the feature extraction step into two task-independent streams, the dual-branch model can facilitate the training process by avoiding learning the mixed degradation all-in-one and thus enhance the final high-resolution prediction results. We evaluate the proposed method in three degradation scenarios. Experiments on these scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method performs more efficiently and favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using dual-stream processing, particularly combining fast and slow processing pathways, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Dual-Stream Architectures Inspired by Biological Systems\n\n1. **Hippocampus-Inspired Dual-Memory Architectures**:\n   - Implement a neural network with two interacting components: a fast-learning module (analogous to the hippocampus) and a slow-learning module (analogous to the neocortex).

This can help in consolidating recent experiences into a more stable knowledge base and prevent overfitting.\n\n## Dynamic Regulation of Plasticity\n\n4. **Dynamic Learning Rates and Plasticity Modulation**:\n   - Implement a time-dependent learning rate that starts high for new information and gradually decreases, mimicking the biological return to baseline activation. This can be coupled with a complementary inhibition strength that increases over time for recently learned patterns, ensuring dynamic modulation of neuronal plasticity.\n\n## Functionally Specialized Subnetworks\n\n5. **Circuit-Specific Mechanisms**:\n   - Design AI architectures with functionally distinct subnetworks that play different roles in learning and consolidation. For example, one subnetwork could specialize in the rapid encoding of new information, while another focuses on selectively inhibiting recent patterns to maintain overall network stability.\n\n## Scale-Invariant Design Integration\n\n6. **Combining Dual-Stream Processing with Scale-Invariant Architectures**:\n   - Modify the architecture to be scale-invariant, ensuring that the scale of parameters does not affect the output of the network. This can be achieved through hierarchical normalization methods that preserve multi-scale information and adaptive sharpness techniques that improve generalization in the analysis note.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n7. **Hardware-Aware Design**:\n   - Optimize the memory hierarchy and ensure hardware-aware design to improve performance. This involves careful balancing between compression and information preservation, and using adaptive mechanisms for dynamic processing in the analysis note.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage the benefits of dual-stream processing, ensuring efficient, scalable, and robust performance.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 88/97 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2112.12731, 2021.

Trash or Treasure? An Interactive Dual-Stream Strategy for Single Image Reflection Separation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dual stream implementation normalization*\n\n*Qiming Hu, Xiaojie Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a general yet simple interactive strategy, namely YTMT, namely $\\textit{your trash is my treasure}$ (YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks and explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely.\n\n**Abstract:** Single image reflection separation (SIRS), as a representative blind source separation task, aims to recover two layers, $\\textit{i.e.}$, transmission and reflection, from one mixed observation, which is challenging due to the highly ill-posed nature. Existing deep learning based solutions typically restore the target layers individually, or with some concerns at the end of the output, barely taking into account the interaction across the two streams/branches. In order to utilize information more efficiently, this work presents a general yet simple interactive strategy, namely $\\textit{your trash is my treasure}$ (YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks. To be specific, we explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely. Inspired by the additive property between the two components, the interactive path can be easily built via transferring, instead of discarding, deactivated information by the ReLU rectifier from one stream to the other. Both ablation studies and experimental results on widely-used SIRS datasets are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of YTMT, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art alternatives. The implementation is quite simple and our code is publicly available at $\\href{https://github.com/mingcv/YTMT-Strategy}{\\textit{https://github.com/mingcv/YTMT-Strategy}}$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. Transition-constant Normalization for Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dual stream implementation normalization*\n\n*Jie Huang, Man Zhou, Jinghao Zhang, Gang Yang, Mingde Yao, Chongyi Li, Zhiwei Xiong, Fengmei Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN), which consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques that capture image style by statistical representation have become a popular component in deep neural networks. Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures. Through extensive experiments on multiple image enhancement tasks, like low-light enhancement, exposure correction, SDR2HDR translation, and image dehazing, our TCN consistently demonstrates performance improvements. Besides, it showcases extensive ability in other tasks including pan-sharpening and medical segmentation.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dual stream implementation normalization*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Efficient Offline Policy Optimization with a Learned Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dual stream implementation normalization*\n\n*Zi-Yan Liu, Siyi Li, W. Lee, Shuicheng Yan, Zhongwen Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to use a regularized one-step look-ahead approach to tackle a few hypotheses where MuZero Unplugged may not work well under the offline RL settings, including learning with limited data coverage, and learning from offline data of stochastic environments.\n\n**Abstract:** MuZero Unplugged presents a promising approach for offline policy learning from logged data. It conducts Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a learned model and leverages Reanalyze algorithm to learn purely from offline data. For good performance, MCTS requires accurate learned models and a large number of simulations, thus costing huge computing time. This paper investigates a few hypotheses where MuZero Unplugged may not work well under the offline RL settings, including 1) learning with limited data coverage; 2) learning from offline data of stochastic environments; 3) improperly parameterized models given the offline data; 4) with a low compute budget. We propose to use a regularized one-step look-ahead approach to tackle the above issues. Instead of planning with the expensive MCTS, we use the learned model to construct an advantage estimation based on a one-step rollout. Policy improvements are towards the direction that maximizes the estimated advantage with regularization of the dataset. We conduct extensive empirical studies with BSuite environments to verify the hypotheses and then run our algorithm on the RL Unplugged Atari benchmark. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves stable performance even with an inaccurate learned model. On the large-scale Atari benchmark, the proposed method outperforms MuZero Unplugged by 43%. Most significantly, it uses only 5.6% wall-clock time (i.e., 1 hour) compared to MuZero Unplugged (i.e., 17.8 hours) to achieve a 150% IQM normalized score with the same hardware and software stacks.

Fisher Efficient Inference of Intractable Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dual stream implementation normalization*\n\n*Song Liu, T. Kanamori, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper derives a Discriminative Likelihood Estimator (DLE) from the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization criterion implemented via density ratio estimation and a Stein operator and proves its consistency and shows that the asymptotic variance of its solution can attain the equality of the efficiency bound under mild regularity conditions.\n\n**Abstract:** Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) has many good properties. For example, the asymptotic variance of MLE solution attains equality of the asymptotic Cram{e}r-Rao lower bound (efficiency bound), which is the minimum possible variance for an unbiased estimator. However, obtaining such MLE solution requires calculating the likelihood function which may not be tractable due to the normalization term of the density model. In this paper, we derive a Discriminative Likelihood Estimator (DLE) from the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization criterion implemented via density ratio estimation and a Stein operator. We study the problem of model inference using DLE. We prove its consistency and show that the asymptotic variance of its solution can attain the equality of the efficiency bound under mild regularity conditions. We also propose a dual formulation of DLE which can be easily optimized. Numerical studies validate our asymptotic theorems and we give an example where DLE successfully estimates an intractable model constructed using a pre-trained deep neural network.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations of dual-stream architectures, adaptive normalization techniques, and memory optimization strategies, here are some relevant insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Dual-Stream Architectures\n\n### Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)\nThe Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) on Arm processors can be highly beneficial for implementing dual-stream architectures efficiently. SVE allows for flexible vector processing, enabling significant performance improvements by adapting to different hardware configurations. This can be particularly useful for parallelizing the computations in dual-stream models, ensuring that the same code can run efficiently on various hardware setups without the need for recompilation or specific optimizations.\n\n### Processing-in-Memory (PIM) Hardware\nUsing Processing-in-Memory (PIM) hardware, such as UPMEM PIM, can significantly enhance the performance of data-intensive applications, including those involving dual-stream architectures. PIM integrates processing cores directly into memory chips, reducing data movement and enhancing efficiency. This architecture can be optimized for balanced memory accesses and efficient thread scheduling, which are crucial for managing multiple streams efficiently.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Techniques for Multi-Scale Processing\n\n### Dense Connections and Feature Fusion\nWhile not directly addressing normalization, the concept of dense connections and feature fusion in the YOLO-DHGC model can provide insights into handling multi-scale features. The use of dense connections to transmit feature information across multiple layers can help in preserving detailed information across different scales. This approach can be adapted to normalization techniques by ensuring that the normalization process is aware of and adapts to the multi-scale nature of the features.\n\n### Hardware-Software Co-optimization\nIn the context of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), hardware-software co-optimization strategies can be applied to develop efficient normalization techniques. For instance, using event-driven computations and optimizing the architecture for specific normalization operations can lead to more efficient and accurate processing. This co-optimization approach can be extended to other types of neural networks, including autoregressive language models, to develop adaptive normalization methods that are both fast and accurate.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies for Parallel Streams\n\n### Memory Optimization in Real-Time DSP\nTechniques from real-time DSP, such as using circular buffers and efficient memory management, can be applied to optimize memory usage in parallel streams. Circular buffers allow for continuous streaming of data without requiring memory reallocation, which can minimize memory access delays and optimize performance. These strategies are crucial for managing the memory usage between multiple streams in a dual-stream architecture.\n\n### PIM Resource Management\nThe UPMEM PIM hardware provides insights into efficient memory management for parallel streams. The approach involves optimizing data distribution across DPUs to avoid inter-DPU/CPU-DPU communications and achieve balanced memory accesses. This, combined with efficient thread scheduling and memory management, can significantly improve the performance of dual-stream architectures by maximizing the aggregated memory bandwidth and minimizing memory access delays.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### SVE APIs and Predicate Registers\nImplementing dual-stream architectures using SVE APIs can provide fine-grained control over vector operations, which is beneficial for managing parallel streams. The use of predicate registers in SVE allows for efficient processing of irregular data sets, which can be crucial in adaptive normalization techniques and multi-scale processing.\n\n### FPGA Implementation\nThe FPGA implementation of the spiking inference accelerator provides a detailed example of how to optimize hardware for efficient processing. This includes streaming spikes and kernels into Block RAMs, executing spiking convolutions, and managing partial sums efficiently. Similar optimization strategies can be applied to the implementation of dual-stream architectures in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop hardware-efficient dual-stream architectures with adaptive normalization methods and optimized memory management strategies, which are essential for improving the performance and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning).

Self-Detoxifying Language Models via Toxification Reversal\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream temporal processing language models*\n\n*Chak Tou Leong, Yi Cheng, Jiashuo Wang, Jian Wang, Wenjie Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a more lightweight approach that enables the PLM itself to achieve \"self-detoxification\", built upon the observation that prepending a negative steering prompt can effectively induce PLMs to generate toxic content.\n\n**Abstract:** Language model detoxification aims to minimize the risk of generating offensive or harmful content in pretrained language models (PLMs) for safer deployment. Existing methods can be roughly categorized as finetuning-based and decoding-based. However, the former is often resource-intensive, while the latter relies on additional components and potentially compromises the generation fluency. In this paper, we propose a more lightweight approach that enables the PLM itself to achieve\"self-detoxification\". Our method is built upon the observation that prepending a negative steering prompt can effectively induce PLMs to generate toxic content. At the same time, we are inspired by the recent research in the interpretability field, which formulates the evolving contextualized representations within the PLM as an information stream facilitated by the attention layers. Drawing on this idea, we devise a method to identify the toxification direction from the normal generation process to the one prompted with the negative prefix, and then steer the generation to the reversed direction by manipulating the information movement within the attention layers. Experimental results show that our approach, without any fine-tuning or extra components, can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. SwapPrompt: Test-Time Prompt Adaptation for Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream temporal processing language models*\n\n*Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo, Wenchao Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SwapPrompt is a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation and achieves state-of-the-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt, a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation. SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism, which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically, we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement, and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets.

Enhancing Large Language Models Against Inductive Instructions with Dual-critique Prompting\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream temporal processing language models*\n\n*Rui Wang, Hongru Wang, Fei Mi, Yi Chen, Rui-Lan Xu, Kam-Fai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The behaviors of LLMs towards inductive instructions are revealed and Dual-critique prompting is proposed to improve LLM robustness against inductive instructions, demonstrating that Dual-critique prompting significantly bolsters the robustness of a diverse array of LLMs, even when confronted with varying degrees of inductive instruction complexity and differing inductive styles.\n\n**Abstract:** Numerous works are proposed to align large language models (LLMs) with human intents to better fulfill instructions, ensuring they are trustful and helpful.Nevertheless, some human instructions are often malicious or misleading and following them will lead to untruthful and unsafe responses.Previous work rarely focused on understanding how LLMs manage instructions based on counterfactual premises, referred to here as inductive instructions, which may stem from users\u2019 false beliefs or malicious intents.In this paper, we aim to reveal the behaviors of LLMs towards inductive instructions and enhance their truthfulness and helpfulness accordingly. Specifically, we first introduce a benchmark of Inductive Instructions (INDust), where the false knowledge is incorporated into instructions in multiple different styles. After extensive human and automatic evaluations, we uncovered a universal vulnerability among LLMs in processing inductive instructions.Additionally, we identified that different inductive styles affect the models\u2019 ability to identify the same underlying errors,and the complexity of the underlying assumptions also influences the model\u2019s performance.Motivated by these results, we propose Dual-critique prompting to improve LLM robustness against inductive instructions.Our experiments demonstrate that Dual-critique prompting significantly bolsters the robustness of a diverse array of LLMs, even when confronted with varying degrees of inductive instruction complexity and differing inductive styles.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. MenatQA: A New Dataset for Testing the Temporal Comprehension and Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream temporal processing language models*\n\n*Yifan Wei, Yisong Su, Huanhuan Ma, Xiaoyan Yu, Fangyu Lei, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** MenatQA constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA, which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown nearly saturated performance on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As a result, it is natural for people to believe that LLMs have also mastered abilities such as time understanding and reasoning. However, research on the temporal sensitivity of LLMs has been insufficiently emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA), which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper tests current mainstream LLMs with different parameter sizes, ranging from billions to hundreds of billions. The results show most LLMs fall behind smaller temporal reasoning models with different degree on these factors. In specific, LLMs show a significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on the temporal information provided in questions. Furthermore, this paper undertakes a preliminary investigation into potential improvement strategies by devising specific prompts and leveraging external tools. These approaches serve as valuable baselines or references for future research endeavors.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. UHGEval: Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation\n\n*From Search Query: dual stream temporal processing language models*\n\n*Xun Liang, Shichao Song, Simin Niu, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Zhaohui Wy, Dawei He, Peng Cheng, Zhonghao Wang, Haiying Deng*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs, is developed and established, to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments regarding hallucination challenges.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal contributors in contemporary natural language processing and are increasingly being applied across a diverse range of industries. However, these large-scale probabilistic statistical models cannot currently ensure the requisite quality in professional content generation. These models often produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the authentic reliability of LLMs in text generation, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. Nevertheless, these benchmarks frequently utilize constrained generation techniques due to cost and temporal constraints. These techniques encompass the use of directed hallucination induction and strategies that deliberately alter authentic text to produce hallucinations. These approaches are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations in text generation is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also executed extensive experiments, evaluating prominent Chinese language models and the GPT series models to derive professional performance insights regarding hallucination challenges.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using a dual-stream architecture, temporal processing, and multi-scale feature integration, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided context and additional insights:\n\n### Dual-Stream Processing Architecture\n\n- **Existing Dual-Stream Architectures**: The concept of dual-stream processing is well-established in cognitive neuroscience, particularly in the context of language processing. The dual-stream model describes two distinct pathways: the ventral stream for semantic processing and the dorsal stream for phonological and motor aspects of speech.\n  - For language models, adapting this concept involves designing parallel fast and slow processing streams. This can be inspired by the spatio-temporal attentional pooling mechanism used in vision-language models, where different types of encoders (e.g., temporal pooling, temporal Transformer, spatio-temporal attentional pooling) are employed to process sequential data efficiently.\n\n### Temporal Processing and Compression\n\n- **Temporal Compression Mechanisms**: The paper on BLIP-3-Video introduces several temporal encoders that can be adapted for language models. For instance, spatio-temporal attentional pooling using TokenLearner can be modified to handle sequential text data, allowing for the selection of informative tokens over time. This approach can help in compressing temporal information while preserving key features.\n  - **Latent Bottleneck**: Implementing a temporal latent bottleneck involves reducing the dimensionality of temporal features while maintaining critical information. This can be achieved through techniques like temporal pooling or using sequential models with attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant tokens.\n\n### Multi-Scale Feature Processing and Normalization\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization**: Efficient multi-scale processing can be achieved by implementing hierarchical normalization approaches. This involves normalizing features at different scales or layers of the model, ensuring that each scale contributes to the overall feature representation without overwhelming the model.\n  - **Scale-Specific Normalization**: This can be done by using layer-specific normalization techniques, such as RMSNorm or other adaptive normalization methods, to ensure that features from different scales are integrated efficiently without significant memory or computational overhead.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Implementations\n\n- **Memory Efficiency Techniques**: To reduce memory overhead, techniques such as using smaller embedding dimensions for the slower stream, employing sparse attention mechanisms, or leveraging state space models can be beneficial. State space models, as discussed in \"State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview,\" can provide a more memory-efficient way to model temporal dependencies.\n  - **Parallel Stream Processing**: Efficient parallel processing can be achieved by optimizing the architecture to utilize current hardware capabilities. This includes using techniques like model parallelism, data parallelism, or a combination of both to minimize memory bandwidth requirements and maximize parallel processing capabilities.\n\n### Implementation Details and Feasibility\n\n- **Implementation Feasibility**: The feasibility of implementing such a model on current hardware can be enhanced by leveraging efficient attention mechanisms like those discussed in \"Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\" and \"Synthesizer: Rethinking Self-Attention in Transformer Models\".\n  - **Memory Bandwidth Requirements**: Optimizing memory bandwidth can be done by carefully designing the model architecture to minimize the number of parameters and the amount of data that needs to be transferred between different components of the model.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Dual-Stream Architecture**: Implement a dual-stream architecture with fast and slow processing streams, inspired by cognitive neuroscience models and adapted for language processing.\n- **Temporal Compression**: Use temporal encoders like spatio-temporal attentional pooling and latent bottleneck techniques to compress temporal information efficiently.\n- **Multi-Scale Processing**: Employ hierarchical normalization and scale-specific normalization to integrate features from different scales efficiently.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Utilize state space models, sparse attention mechanisms, and optimized parallel processing to reduce memory overhead and enhance hardware efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive language model that leverages dual-stream processing, efficient temporal compression, and multi-scale feature integration, all while ensuring memory efficiency and hardware feasibility.\n",

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.54)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

A Dual-Stream Neural Network Explains the Functional Segregation of Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways in Human Brains\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Minkyu Choi, Kuan Han, Xiaokai Wang, Yizhen Zhang, Zhongming Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is speculated that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** The human visual system uses two parallel pathways for spatial processing and object recognition. In contrast, computer vision systems tend to use a single feedforward pathway, rendering them less robust, adaptive, or efficient than human vision. To bridge this gap, we developed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human eyes and brain. At the input level, the model samples two complementary visual patterns to mimic how the human eyes use magnocellular and parvocellular retinal ganglion cells to separate retinal inputs to the brain. At the backend, the model processes the separate input patterns through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to mimic how the human brain uses the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways for parallel visual processing. The first branch (WhereCNN) samples a global view to learn spatial attention and control eye movements. The second branch (WhatCNN) samples a local view to represent the object around the fixation. Over time, the two branches interact recurrently to build a scene representation from moving fixations. We compared this model with the human brains processing the same movie and evaluated their functional alignment by linear transformation. The WhereCNN and WhatCNN branches were found to differentially match the dorsal and ventral pathways of the visual cortex, respectively, primarily due to their different learning objectives. These model-based results lead us to speculate that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs. This dual-stream model takes a further step in brain-inspired computer vision, enabling parallel neural networks to actively explore and understand the visual surroundings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Joint Edge-Model Sparse Learning is Provably Efficient for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu, Songtao Lu, Miaoyuan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error and proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexityand improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include \\textit{graph sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and \\textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. DIVISION: Memory Efficient Training via Dual Activation Precision\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Guanchu Wang, Zirui Liu, Zhimeng Jiang, Ninghao Liu, Nannan Zou, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision during the training, which can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation.\n\n**Abstract:** Activation compressed training provides a solution towards reducing the memory cost of training deep neural networks~(DNNs). However, state-of-the-art work combines a search of quantization bit-width with the training, which makes the procedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a simple and effective method to compress DNN training. Our method is motivated by an instructive observation: DNN backward propagation mainly utilizes the low-frequency component (LFC) of the activation maps, while the majority of memory is for caching the high-frequency component (HFC) during the training. This indicates the HFC of activation maps is highly redundant and compressible during DNN training, which inspires our proposed Dual Activation Precision (DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision. This can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation such that DIVISION maintains competitive model accuracy. Experiment results show DIVISION has better comprehensive performance than state-of-the-art methods, including over 10x compression of activation maps and competitive training throughput, without loss of model accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Memory Efficient Optimizers with 4-bit States\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Bingrui Li, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work pushes optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments, and identifies a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solves this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizer states are a major source of memory consumption for training neural networks, limiting the maximum trainable model within given memory budget. Compressing the optimizer states from 32-bit floating points to lower bitwidth is promising to reduce the training memory footprint, while the current lowest achievable bitwidth is 8-bit. In this work, we push optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments. Specifically, we find that moments have complicated outlier patterns, that current block-wise quantization cannot accurately approximate. We use a smaller block size and propose to utilize both row-wise and column-wise information for better quantization. We further identify a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solve this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point. Our 4-bit optimizers are evaluated on a wide variety of benchmarks including natural language understanding, machine translation, image classification, and instruction tuning. On all the tasks our optimizers can achieve comparable accuracy with their full-precision counterparts, while enjoying better memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively.

Effective Multi-User Delay-Constrained Scheduling with Deep Recurrent Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient dual stream neural networks*\n\n*Longbo Huang, Zhixuan Fang, Yu Chen, Ling Pan, Pihe Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-user delay constrained scheduling is important in many real-world applications including wireless communication, live streaming, and cloud computing. Yet, it poses a critical challenge since the scheduler needs to make real-time decisions to guarantee the delay and resource constraints simultaneously without prior information of system dynamics, which can be time-varying and hard to estimate. Moreover, many practical scenarios suffer from partial observability issues, e.g., due to sensing noise or hidden correlation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, named Recurrent Softmax Delayed Deep Double Deterministic Policy Gradient ($\\mathtt{RSD4}$), which is a data-driven method based on a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation. $\\mathtt{RSD4}$ guarantees resource and delay constraints by Lagrangian dual and delay-sensitive queues, respectively. It also efficiently tackles partial observability with a memory mechanism enabled by the recurrent neural network (RNN) and introduces user-level decomposition and node-level merging to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments on simulated/real-world datasets demonstrate that $\\mathtt{RSD4}$ is robust to system dynamics and partially observable environments, and achieves superior performances over existing DRL and non-DRL-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using a dual-stream neural network architecture, focusing on memory efficiency, stream synchronization, and hardware optimization, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Dual-Stream Architectures\n\n- The concept of dual-stream processing, as seen in the \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\" by Didolkar et al. (2022), involves separating computation into slow and fast streams. This can be optimized by using techniques such as model pruning and sparse connections. For instance, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" suggests that there are sparse subnetworks within dense networks that can achieve similar performance, which can be applied to reduce memory usage.\n\n## Techniques for Managing Parallel Streams in Neural Networks\n\n- Managing parallel streams efficiently involves careful design of the information flow between the streams. The use of hierarchical processing and multi-scale integration can help. For example, the \"DenseMamba\" approach by He et al. (2024) enhances state space models with dense hidden connections, which maintains training parallelizability and inference efficiency. This can be adapted to dual-stream architectures to ensure efficient information exchange between the fast and slow streams.\n\n## Hardware Optimization for Dual-Stream Processing\n\n- Hardware optimization is crucial for efficient parallel processing. The use of GPU architectures, such as NVIDIA's streaming multiprocessors (SMs), can significantly improve performance. These SMs use the Single-Instruction Multiple-Threads (SIMT) paradigm, which is highly efficient for parallel computations. Optimizing the model to fit within the memory constraints of these devices and effectively moving data between devices can be achieved through techniques like model parallelism and data parallelism.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies\n\n- To optimize memory usage, techniques such as weight sharing, quantization, and knowledge distillation can be employed. For example, learning both weights and connections in neural networks, as proposed by Song et al. (2015), can help in pruning unnecessary parameters, thus reducing memory requirements.\n\n## Stream Synchronization Methods\n\n- Synchronizing the fast and slow streams requires careful design to ensure that the information from both streams is integrated effectively. This can be achieved through mechanisms like dense connections and hierarchical processing, which allow for efficient exchange of information between different temporal scales.\n\n## Parallel Processing Techniques\n\n- Parallel processing techniques such as data parallelism and model parallelism are essential for scaling dual-stream architectures. These techniques can be optimized using libraries like CUDA, which provide efficient tools for managing parallel computations on GPUs.\n\nIn summary, to achieve memory-efficient dual-stream neural networks, researchers should focus on:\n\n- **Model Pruning and Sparse Connections**: Techniques like the lottery ticket hypothesis to reduce memory usage.\n- **Hierarchical Processing and Multi-scale Integration**: Approaches like DenseMamba to ensure efficient information exchange.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Utilizing GPU architectures and optimizing data movement between devices.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Techniques such as weight sharing, quantization, and knowledge distillation.\n- **Stream Synchronization**: Mechanisms like dense connections and hierarchical processing.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: temporal processing language models stream synchronization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Self-Detoxifying Language Models via Toxification Reversal\n\n*From Search Query: temporal processing language models stream synchronization*\n\n*Chak Tou Leong, Yi Cheng, Jiashuo Wang, Jian Wang, Wenjie Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a more lightweight approach that enables the PLM itself to achieve \"self-detoxification\", built upon the observation that prepending a negative steering prompt can effectively induce PLMs to generate toxic content.\n\n**Abstract:** Language model detoxification aims to minimize the risk of generating offensive or harmful content in pretrained language models (PLMs) for safer deployment. Existing methods can be roughly categorized as finetuning-based and decoding-based. However, the former is often resource-intensive, while the latter relies on additional components and potentially compromises the generation fluency. In this paper, we propose a more lightweight approach that enables the PLM itself to achieve\"self-detoxification\". Our method is built upon the observation that prepending a negative steering prompt can effectively induce PLMs to generate toxic content. At the same time, we are inspired by the recent research in the interpretability field, which formulates the evolving contextualized representations within the PLM as an information stream facilitated by the attention layers. Drawing on this idea, we devise a method to identify the toxification direction from the normal generation process to the one prompted with the negative prefix, and then steer the generation to the reversed direction by manipulating the information movement within the attention layers. Experimental results show that our approach, without any fine-tuning or extra components, can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. MenatQA: A New Dataset for Testing the Temporal Comprehension and Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: temporal processing language models stream synchronization*\n\n*Yifan Wei, Yisong Su, Huanhuan Ma, Xiaoyan Yu, Fangyu Lei, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** MenatQA constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA, which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown nearly saturated performance on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As a result, it is natural for people to believe that LLMs have also mastered abilities such as time understanding and reasoning. However, research on the temporal sensitivity of LLMs has been insufficiently emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA), which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor, order factor, counterfactual factor) with total 2,853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper tests current mainstream LLMs with different parameter sizes, ranging from billions to hundreds of billions. The results show most LLMs fall behind smaller temporal reasoning models with different degree on these factors. In specific, LLMs show a significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on the temporal information provided in questions. Furthermore, this paper undertakes a preliminary investigation into potential improvement strategies by devising specific prompts and leveraging external tools. These approaches serve as valuable baselines or references for future research endeavors.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. UHGEval: Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation\n\n*From Search Query: temporal processing language models stream synchronization*\n\n*Xun Liang, Shichao Song, Simin Niu, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Zhaohui Wy, Dawei He, Peng Cheng, Zhonghao Wang, Haiying Deng*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs, is developed and established, to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments regarding hallucination challenges.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal contributors in contemporary natural language processing and are increasingly being applied across a diverse range of industries. However, these large-scale probabilistic statistical models cannot currently ensure the requisite quality in professional content generation. These models often produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the authentic reliability of LLMs in text generation, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. Nevertheless, these benchmarks frequently utilize constrained generation techniques due to cost and temporal constraints. These techniques encompass the use of directed hallucination induction and strategies that deliberately alter authentic text to produce hallucinations. These approaches are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations in text generation is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also executed extensive experiments, evaluating prominent Chinese language models and the GPT series models to derive professional performance insights regarding hallucination challenges.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Generating Training Data with Language Models: Towards Zero-Shot Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: temporal processing language models stream synchronization*\n\n*Yu Meng, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a simple approach that uses both types of PLMs for fully zero-shot learning of NLU tasks without requiring any task-specific data: a unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a bidirectionalPLM.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks: Unidirectional PLMs (e.g., GPT) are well known for their superior text generation capabilities; bidirectional PLMs (e.g., BERT) have been the prominent choice for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While both types of models have achieved promising few-shot learning performance, their potential for zero-shot learning has been underexplored. In this paper, we present a simple approach that uses both types of PLMs for fully zero-shot learning of NLU tasks without requiring any task-specific data: A unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a bidirectional PLM. With quality training data selected based on the generation probability and regularization techniques (label smoothing and temporal ensembling) applied to the fine-tuning stage for better generalization and stability, our approach demonstrates strong performance across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark (e.g., 72.3/73.8 on MNLI-m/mm and 92.8 on SST-2), significantly outperforming zero-shot prompting methods and achieving even comparable results to strong few-shot approaches using 32 training samples per class.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 5. Mind the Gap: Assessing Temporal Generalization in Neural Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: temporal processing language models stream synchronization*\n\n*Angeliki Lazaridou, A. Kuncoro, E. Gribovskaya, Devang Agrawal, Adam Liska, Tayfun Terzi, Mai Gim\u00e9nez, Cyprien de Masson d'Autume, Tom\u00e1s Kocisk\u00fd, Sebastian Ruder, Dani Yogatama, Kris Cao, Susannah Young, Phil Blunsom*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that now is the right time to rethink the static way in which language models are trained and evaluated, and develop adaptive language models that can remain up-to-date with respect to the ever-changing and non-stationary world.\n\n**Abstract:** Our world is open-ended, non-stationary, and constantly evolving; thus what we talk about and how we talk about it change over time. This inherent dynamic nature of language contrasts with the current static language modelling paradigm, which trains and evaluates models on utterances from overlapping time periods. Despite impressive recent progress, we demonstrate that Transformer-XL language models perform worse in the realistic setup of predicting future utterances from beyond their training period, and that model performance becomes increasingly worse with time. We find that, while increasing model size alone -- a key driver behind recent progress -- does not solve this problem, having models that continually update their knowledge with new information can indeed mitigate this performance degradation over time. Hence, given the compilation of ever-larger language modelling datasets, combined with the growing list of language-model-based NLP applications that require up-to-date factual knowledge about the world, we argue that now is the right time to rethink the static way in which we currently train and evaluate our language models, and develop adaptive language models that can remain up-to-date with respect to our ever-changing and non-stationary world. We publicly release our dynamic, streaming language modelling benchmarks for WMT and arXiv to facilitate language model evaluation that takes temporal dynamics into account.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 189  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on temporal processing, stream synchronization, and scale-specific feature processing, here are some key insights and methodologies from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Temporal Processing Mechanisms in Language Models\n\n### Temporal Information-Aware Embedding\nLarge language models (LLMs) can be trained to recognize and prioritize temporal data through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding. This approach enhances the model's attention to both direct temporal information and adjacent details, allowing it to better understand the context of temporal relationships. For instance, this method helps LLMs to accurately interpret questions involving time-sensitive information, such as understanding intervals and sequences of events.\n\n### Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning\nThis methodology further enhances the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs by introducing a nuanced approach to training. It provides both remote and proximal negative answers based on varying temporal distances, refining the model's ability to discern correct answers from incorrect ones. This structured feedback loop is essential for improving the model's performance in tasks requiring temporal reasoning.\n\n## Stream Synchronization and Integration Techniques\n\n### Dual-Stream Processing\nDual-stream architectures, such as those discussed in Choi et al. (2023), show promise in functional segregation and efficient processing pathways. These architectures can be optimized for balancing recall and throughput, as seen in the BASED architecture, which combines linear and sliding window attention to achieve higher throughput on language generation tasks [Analysis Note].\n\n### Stream Coordination Strategies\nEfficient stream coordination can be achieved through architectures like Ring Attention, which handles long sequences efficiently by using blockwise transformers. This approach allows for near-infinite context processing while maintaining efficiency [Analysis Note].\n\n## Scale-Specific Feature Processing\n\n### Multi-Scale Feature Integration\nFor multi-scale feature integration, techniques such as those used in neural temporal point processes (TPPs) can be insightful. Neural TPPs combine point process literature with deep learning approaches, enabling the construction of flexible and efficient models for continuous-time event sequences. These models can handle both structured and unstructured data and are scalable, making them suitable for integrating features at different scales.\n\n### Efficient Implementation Approaches\nMemory efficiency is crucial for large-scale language models. Techniques like DIVISION, which uses dual activation precision to compress high-frequency components (HFC) into a lightweight copy during training, can significantly reduce memory usage. Additionally, 4-bit optimization states and mixed ghost clipping can provide substantial memory savings without compromising performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Temporal Response Function (TRF) Models\nTRF models, as discussed in the context of predicting MEG signals based on linguistic features, can provide insights into how linguistic features influence neural responses over time. This approach involves aligning MEG data with linguistic features and using ridge regression to estimate TRF coefficients. While not directly applied to language models, this method highlights the importance of aligning temporal features with model outputs, which can be adapted for autoregressive language models.\n\n### Durable Execution and Scalability\nThe Temporal platform, while not directly related to language models, offers insights into building scalable and reliable applications. Its approach to durable execution and failure management can be metaphorically applied to ensuring that language models can handle failures and interruptions efficiently, maintaining their state and continuing from the last successful point. This concept can be translated into designing more robust and scalable language models.\n\nBy integrating these methodologies\u2014temporal information-aware embedding, granular contrastive reinforcement learning, dual-stream processing, multi-scale feature integration, and efficient implementation approaches\u2014the researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that excel in temporal processing and stream synchronization.\n",
