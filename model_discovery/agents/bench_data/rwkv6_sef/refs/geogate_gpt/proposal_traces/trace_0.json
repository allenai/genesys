This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks (Avg.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Linear-Time Transformers via Vector Quantization (Avg.

In our large-scale experiments, Transformer-VQ is shown highly competitive in quality, obtaining 0.99 bpb on Enwik8, 26.6 ppl on PG-19, and 3.16 bpb on ImageNet64. In addition, the optimized implementation of Transformer-VQ is over 3x faster than a comparable quadratic-time transformer at sequence length 8k, is over 12x faster at 32k, and can scale to 131k with similar throughput.

Transformer-VQ differs from Perceivers in that it computes dense self-attention in linear time, instead of just cross-attention. Thus, while Perceivers' long-range layers incur a quadratic time complexity during sampling, TransformerVQ generates sequences in linear time. ### 4.4 Gated SEQUENCE MODELS\n\nGated attention was introduced in FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) as a fusion of attention sublayers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and GLU-based MLP sublayers (Shazeer, 2020). Various gating mechanisms have previously been used to stabilize training of transformers (Parisotto et al., 2019) and other sequence models including S4 (Gu et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling? (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/28 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. FedWon: Triumphing Multi-domain Federated Learning Without Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: novel normalization techniques*\n\n*Weiming Zhuang, Lingjuan Lyu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This research proposes a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon), which eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization and can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) enhances data privacy with collaborative in-situ training on decentralized clients. Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients' data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Transition-constant Normalization for Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: novel normalization techniques*\n\n*Jie Huang, Man Zhou, Jinghao Zhang, Gang Yang, Mingde Yao, Chongyi Li, Zhiwei Xiong, Fengmei Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN), which consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques that capture image style by statistical representation have become a popular component in deep neural networks. Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures.

Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Through a pseudo information highway, we introduce a gated component self-dependency units (SDU) that incorporates LSTM-styled gating units to replenish internal semantic importance within the multi-dimensional latent space of individual representations. The subsidiary content-based SDU gates allow for the information flow of modulated latent embeddings through skipped connections, leading to a clear margin of convergence speed with gradient descent algorithms. We may unveil the role of gating mechanism to aid in the context-based Transformer modules, with hypothesizing that SDU gates, especially on shallow layers, could push it faster to step towards suboptimal points during the optimization process.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Improving the Gating Mechanism of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms*\n\n*Albert Gu, \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, T. Paine, Matthew W. Hoffman, Razvan Pascanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Gating mechanisms are widely used in neural network models, where they allow gradients to backpropagate more easily through depth or time. However, their saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. LSTM-based Deep Learning Models for Non-factoid Answer Selection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ming Tan, Cicero dos Santos, Bing Xiang, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we apply a general deep learning (DL) framework for the answer\nselection task, which does not depend on manually defined features or\nlinguistic tools. The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions\nand answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and\nmeasure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic\nmodel in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite\nrepresentation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural\nnetwork with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple\nbut efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer\nrepresentation according to the question context. Several variations of models\nare provided. The models are examined by two datasets, including TREC-QA and\nInsuranceQA.

Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Neural-based Natural Language Generation in Dialogue using RNN\n  Encoder-Decoder with Semantic Aggregation\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms*\n\n*Van-Khanh Tran, Le-Minh Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component in spoken\ndialogue systems. This paper presents a model called Encoder-Aggregator-Decoder\nwhich is an extension of an Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder\narchitecture. The proposed Semantic Aggregator consists of two components: an\nAligner and a Refiner. The Aligner is a conventional attention calculated over\nthe encoded input information, while the Refiner is another attention or gating\nmechanism stacked over the attentive Aligner in order to further select and\naggregate the semantic elements. The proposed model can be jointly trained both\nsentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language\nutterances.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Barron, Austin Stone, Kurt Konolige*\n\n**Abstract:** We systematically compare and analyze a set of key components in unsupervised optical flow to identify which photometric loss, occlusion handling, and smoothness regularization is most effective. Alongside this investigation we construct a number of novel improvements to unsupervised flow models, such as cost volume normalization, stopping the gradient at the occlusion mask, encouraging smoothness before upsampling the flow field, and continual self-supervision with image resizing. By combining the results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are able to present a new unsupervised flow technique that significantly outperforms the previous unsupervised state-of-the-art and performs on par with supervised FlowNet2 on the KITTI 2015 dataset, while also being significantly simpler than related approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dropout as an Implicit Gating Mechanism For Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms*\n\n*Seyed-Iman Mirzadeh, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Hassan Ghasemzadeh*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated an outstanding ability to achieve complex learning tasks across various domains. However, they suffer from the \"catastrophic forgetting\" problem when they face a sequence of learning tasks, where they forget the old ones as they learn new tasks. This problem is also highly related to the \"stability-plasticity dilemma\". The more plastic the network, the easier it can learn new tasks, but the faster it also forgets previous ones. Conversely, a stable network cannot learn new tasks as fast as a very plastic network. However, it is more reliable to preserve the knowledge it has learned from the previous tasks. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome the forgetting problem by making the neural network parameters more stable, and some of them have mentioned the significance of dropout in continual learning. However, their relationship has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we investigate this relationship and show that a stable network with dropout learns a gating mechanism such that for different tasks, different paths of the network are active. Our experiments show that the stability achieved by this implicit gating plays a very critical role in leading to performance comparable to or better than other involved continual learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-24\n\n\n\n#### 6. Attend and Rectify: a Gated Attention Mechanism for Fine-Grained Recovery\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jordi Gonz\u00e0lez, Pau Rodr\u00edguez, Josep M. Gonfaus, Guillem Cucurull, F. Xavier Roca*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural\nNetworks for fine-grained recognition. It learns to attend to lower-level\nfeature activations without requiring part annotations and uses these\nactivations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. In\ncontrast to other approaches, the proposed mechanism is modular,\narchitecture-independent and efficient both in terms of parameters and\ncomputation required. Experiments show that networks augmented with our\napproach systematically improve their classification accuracy and become more\nrobust to clutter. As a result, Wide Residual Networks augmented with our\nproposal surpasses the state of the art classification accuracies in CIFAR-10,\nthe Adience gender recognition task, Stanford dogs, and UEC Food-100.\n\n**Conference:** attend-and-rectify-a-gated-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, novel normalization techniques, and gating mechanisms, here are some key developments and techniques that can be considered:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe DAAM, as proposed in the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT), integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically adjust the focus and width of the attention distribution, which is particularly useful for handling non-stationary data. DAAM shows significant improvements in accuracy, especially in tasks involving multiple modalities like speech, text, and vision.\n\n### Differential Transformer\nThe Differential Transformer introduces a \"differential attention\" mechanism that cancels out noise and amplifies attention to the most relevant parts of the input. This is achieved by partitioning the query and key vectors into two groups and computing two separate softmax attention maps, then using the difference between these maps as the attention score. This method helps in focusing on relevant context and reducing the impact of irrelevant information, which can improve efficiency and accuracy.\n\n## Novel Normalization Techniques\n\n### Enhancing RMSNorm\nWhile RMSNorm is currently used, there is room for improvement. One approach could be to explore other normalization techniques that complement RMSNorm. For instance, the use of adaptive normalization techniques, such as those that adjust based on the input context, could enhance the model's performance. The DAAM mechanism, for example, uses variance scaling factors to adapt the attention distribution, which could be integrated with existing normalization methods to improve stability and accuracy.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n\n### Iterative Gating Mechanisms\nThe Mogrifier LSTM architecture introduces iterative gating mechanisms that allow for more complex interactions between inputs and hidden states. This concept can be adapted for attention mechanisms to enhance feature interactions and model expressiveness. By incorporating multiple rounds of mutual gating, the model can better capture long-range dependencies and improve information flow[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Density Adaptive Attention with Gating\nThe DAAM mechanism can also be seen as incorporating a form of gating through its adaptive mean and variance adjustments. Each attention head can focus on different aspects of the data, allowing the model to adaptively gate the attention based on the input context. This multi-head design enhances the model's adaptability to non-Gaussian traits and improves its ability to focus on contextually relevant information.\n\n## Combining Efficiency and Expressiveness\n\n### Control Variates for Attention\nUsing control variates, as mentioned in \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates,\" can improve the efficiency of attention mechanisms while maintaining accuracy. This approach can be combined with the iterative gating mechanisms and adaptive attention techniques to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Parallelization and Optimization\nThe Differential Transformer's approach to maintaining efficiency through parallelization and optimization techniques, despite the additional subtraction operation, is noteworthy. Similar optimization strategies can be applied to other efficient attention mechanisms to ensure they remain computationally viable.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014efficient attention mechanisms like DAAM and Differential Transformer, novel normalization techniques that adapt to the input context, and iterative gating mechanisms\u2014the researcher can potentially improve the autoregressive language model's efficiency, accuracy, and robustness while maintaining or enhancing its expressiveness.\n",

Conclusion and Limitations\n\nWe presented CHELA for robust and efficient modeling of long sequences. CHELA is an SSM-attention hybrid architecture that computes both structured and data-dependent patterns in linear time with respect to sequence length. Its superior performance is enabled by considering the global view of the Short-Long Convolutions and real linear\n\nHardware-Efficient Linear Attention with gating mechanisms. Compared to other hybrid linear models, we are currently the first to achieve performance improvement while maintaining linear complexity. Our large-scale and diverse experiments demonstrate that CHELA is an efficient and flexible long sequence model with excellent performance on image, text, logical reasoning, and speech data. However, CHELA also has some limitations. The optimal combinations of short convolutions are not explored in this paper, which should be a future research direction of designing dynamic short-convolutional components according to the input data. Moreover, the time-varying SSM is a different idea to achieve this goal. By embracing CHELA as a starting point in the integration of hardware-efficient implementation into hybrid models, we are taking the initial step towards achieving greater efficiency gains in the future. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (No. 2021YFA1301603), National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (No. U21A20427), Project (No. WU2022A009) from the Center of Synthetic Biology and Integrated Bioengineering of Westlake University and Project (No. WU2023C019) from the Westlake University Industries of the Future Research Funding.

We have considered broader ethical impacts and do not foresee CHELA directly leading to negative societal consequences. All datasets and models used are existing public resources that do not contain private or sensitive information. Through discussing the hybrid design of linear attention and SSM models, we aim to make sequence mixers much more efficient by fully leveraging hardware and different model features. Besides, as the community proposes new methods, we encourage discussing any potential negative impacts early in the research process. Overall, we believe hardware-efficient style and the combination of structured and data-dependent patterns are the dominant trends of the future for efficient sequence modeling. ## References\n\nAinslie, J., Ontanon, S., Alberti, C., Cvicek, V., Fisher, Z., Pham, P., Ravula, A., Sanghai, S., Wang, Q., and Yang, L.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/32 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis so-called FFT convolution scales in linear complexity when dealing with sequences with length $L$. ## 3. Why Combining Long Conv and Attention? As mentioned in Section 1, both long convolution and linear attention mechanisms have their limitations in spite of their widespread use and impressive accomplishments in sequence modeling. By bridging their benefits together, we push the limitation of the hybrid model, which allows us to benefit from the strong inductive bias of structured memory while still having the ability to learn complex datadependent patterns in true linear time with respect to length. The following two issues are the two main obstacles to extreme performance in long-sequence modeling. Linear Attention is the Efficiency Bottleneck. We can see from Fig. 1 right that as the input sequence grows, the actual efficiency of linear attention is much lower than that of S4, despite the fact that the complexity of the S 4 model is $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ as for long convolution and $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ for linear attention. The two obstacles to achieving a practical wall-clock speedup are intensive GPU memory access and cumulative summation (cumsum) in a casual setting. Inspired by Flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), we effectively doubled the speed of linear attention. Long Convolution Needs Short Convolutions. To match the efficiency of hardware-efficient linear attention, the long convolution is considered as a simpler and faster SSM model for long sequence abstraction. However, it requires additional constraint regularizations for stable performance on different data types. This is because it is hard for a single long convolutional kernel to learn multiple frequencies simultaneously, i.e., token patterns that repeat a lot versus those that occur more sparsely. We thereby introduce multiresolution short convolutional kernels to share the learning pressure of long convolution. They can also be reparameterized by simple linear transformation into a single kernel to speed up the inference phase. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-04.jpg?height=610&width=1446&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=270)\n\nFigure 2. CHELA-model architecture. Figure (a) shows the CHELA layer. Figure (b) is a simplified graphic demonstration of the key components of CHELA: Short-Long Convolutions and Flash Linear Attention. HBM and SRAM denote high bandwidth memory and static random-access memory in GPU, respectively. ## 4. CHELA: Short-Long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\nIn this section, motivated by the above issues, we propose CHELA, short-long convolutions with hardware-efficient linear attention, which fully enjoys the benefits of each. We first describe how the tiling method is used in linear attention to reach the theoretical performance. We then introduce a simple and effective module named short-long convolutions to enhance the ability of global abstraction in this hybrid design. The blocks of CHELA are demonstrated in detailed architecture, including feed-forward and normalization layers. Moreover, we also discuss the relationship between CHELA and two closely related hybrid models: MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), SPADE (Zuo et al., 2023). ### 4.1. Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\nIn response to the first question, we follow a tiling approach from GLA (Yang et al., 2024), which employs the classic\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-04.jpg?height=419&width=777&top_left_y=1924&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 3. Illustration Short-long Module and the effect of Short Convolution.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/32 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIt is worth noting that their complexity is essentially quadratic, and the corresponding linear versions both suffer performance degradation (see Fig. 1 left). While it is true that the simple use of a chunk linearization strategy can rival the speed of SSMs, the drop in performance is significant. We, therefore, abandon this strategy and the softmax function to accelerate the linear attention operations of the kernel-based approach. In addition, long convolution (Fu et al., 2023b) is more efficient and easier to implement than the traditional SSMs. We believe combining these two modules could release the true power of the hybrid model with faster speed and better performance. However, the existence of such a dilemma is worth considering: (1) the linear attention in hybrid models is a speed bottleneck for long convolution, the comparison is shown in Fig. 1 right; (2) the instability of long convolution makes attention hard to optimize. Specifically, due to the intense memory access (I/O) on the GPU and cumulative summation (cumsum) operation in a casual setting,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-02.jpg?height=550&width=1454&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=300)\n\nFigure 1. Demonstration of (left) comparison of various popular models on the Long Range Arena Dataset, and (right) speed benchmark on different implementations of attentions. Figure left, despite showing promising performance of SSM-Attention models, the linear version of these models degenerated. Figure right benchmarks attention speed with around 200 M parameters, showing linear attention is not linear with sequence length and is significantly slower than S 4 , which can be a speed bottleneck in these hybrid designs. the notable reduction in complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ in linear attention is only theoretical (Qin et al., 2024); On the other hand, the long convolution needs hand-crafted regularizations to prevent over-fitting high-frequency noise. To escape the dilemma, we have developed a novel model called CHELA, which stands for short-long Convolutional with Hardware-Efficient $\\underline{\\text { Linear }} \\underline{\\text { Attention. This model is }}$ designed to effectively and efficiently capture complex dependencies in long inputs. Inspired by FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), the model comprises multiple layers of real linear token mixers with hardware-friendly implementation with a gating mechanism that achieves comparable performance to full attention. We have added a stabilizer, reparameterizable (Ding et al., 2022; 2023) short-long convolutions, to the bottom layer of the long convolution to integrate multiple frequencies with inputs. As a result, the top layers of CHELA capture more refined data-dependent information using linear attention, while the convolutions add a structural bias that enhances global abstraction in multi-level frequencies. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CHELA on various datasets and tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020b), which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, CHELA is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer but also yields better performance. In all the settings, CHELA outperforms the baselines. Finally, we provide further analysis and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness. Our contribution can be summarized in three folds:\n\n- Efficient Implementation: We release the potential speed of linear attention in the attention-ssm hybrid model, maintaining a constant rate regardless of sequence length with fixed memory. - New Design: We improve multi-frequency learning with multi-level convolutional hierarchies, leading to better performance and stability for long convolution. - Promising Results: By connecting the above two basic modules, we propose CHELA for efficient long sequence learners are capable of both global information abstraction and fine-grained data-dependent selection.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid attention architectures, memory efficient sequence handling, attention integration techniques\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. CoAtNet: Marrying Convolution and Attention for All Data Sizes\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention architectures*\n\n*Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents CoAtNets, a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention and (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have attracted increasing interests in computer vision, but they still fall behind state-of-the-art convolutional networks. In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 991  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 2. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention architectures*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

LambdaNetworks: Modeling Long-Range Interactions Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention architectures*\n\n*Irwan Bello*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, C OCO object detection and COCO instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** We present lambda layers -- an alternative framework to self-attention -- for capturing long-range interactions between an input and structured contextual information (e.g. a pixel surrounded by other pixels). Lambda layers capture such interactions by transforming available contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately. Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and COCO instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design LambdaResNets, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. LambdaResNets reach excellent accuracies on ImageNet while being 3.2 - 4.4x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. When training with an additional 130M pseudo-labeled images, LambdaResNets achieve up to a 9.5x speed-up over the corresponding EfficientNet checkpoints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 167  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. RelayAttention for Efficient Large Language Model Serving with Long System Prompts\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient sequence handling*\n\n*Lei Zhu, Xinjiang Wang, Wayne Zhang, Rynson W. H. Lau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens, and has observed significant performance improvements to a production-level system, vLLM, through integration with RelayAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** A practical large language model (LLM) service may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (\\ie, key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention. We have observed significant performance improvements to a production-level system, vLLM, through integration with RelayAttention. The improvements are even more profound with longer system prompts.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Bi-Directional Block Self-Attention for Fast and Memory-Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient sequence handling*\n\n*Tao Shen, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN), for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding that achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN /CNN/SAN.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention networks (SAN) are commonly used to produce context-aware representations. RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)\", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient sequence handling*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1345  (*Influential: 135*)\n\n#### 7.

We operationalize sites of multimodal integration as regions where a multimodal vision-language model predicts recordings better than unimodal language, unimodal vision, or linearly-integrated language-vision models. Our target DNN models span different architectures (e.g., convolutional networks and transformers) and multimodal training techniques (e.g., cross-attention and contrastive learning). As a key enabling step, we first demonstrate that trained vision and language models systematically outperform their randomly initialized counterparts in their ability to predict SEEG signals. We then compare unimodal and multimodal models against one another. Because our target DNN models often have different architectures, number of parameters, and training sets (possibly obscuring those differences attributable to integration), we carry out a controlled comparison of two models (SLIP and SimCLR), which keep all of these attributes the same aside from input modality. Using this approach, we identify a sizable number of neural sites (on average 141 out of 1090 total sites or 12.94%) and brain regions where multimodal integration seems to occur. Additionally, we find that among the variants of multimodal training techniques we assess, CLIP-style training is the best suited for downstream prediction of the neural activity in these sites.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Yang, Zuo-Qiang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and Generic Model Training in Fed-LT (FedLoGe), which enhances both local and generic model performance through the integration of representation learning and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Long-Tailed Learning (Fed-LT), a paradigm wherein data collected from decentralized local clients manifests a globally prevalent long-tailed distribution, has garnered considerable attention in recent times. In the context of Fed-LT, existing works have predominantly centered on addressing the data imbalance issue to enhance the efficacy of the generic global model while neglecting the performance at the local level. In contrast, conventional Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) techniques are primarily devised to optimize personalized local models under the presumption of a balanced global data distribution. This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and Generic Model Training in Fed-LT (FedLoGe), which enhances both local and generic model performance through the integration of representation learning and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework. Our investigation reveals the feasibility of employing a shared backbone as a foundational framework for capturing overarching global trends, while concurrently employing individualized classifiers to encapsulate distinct refinements stemming from each client's local features. Building upon this discovery, we establish the Static Sparse Equiangular Tight Frame Classifier (SSE-C), inspired by neural collapse principles that naturally prune extraneous noisy features and foster the acquisition of potent data representations. Furthermore, leveraging insights from imbalance neural collapse's classifier norm patterns, we develop Global and Local Adaptive Feature Realignment (GLA-FR) via an auxiliary global classifier and personalized Euclidean norm transfer to align global features with client preferences. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet, and iNaturalist demonstrate the advantage of our method over state-of-the-art pFL and Fed-LT approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention architectures*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient sequence handling*\n\n*Wancai Zhang, Hui Xiong, JianXin Li, Shuai Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shanghang Zhang, Haoyi Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient sequence handling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. MobileNetV4 -- Universal Models for the Mobile Ecosystem\n\n*From Search Query: attention integration techniques*\n\n*Andrew Howard, Daniele Moro, Tenghui Zhu, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Berkin Akin, Chengxi Ye, Colby Banbury, Weijun Wang, Fan Yang, Shixin Luo, Marco Fornoni, Manolis Delakis, Chas Leichner, Danfeng Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the latest generation of MobileNets, known as MobileNetV4 (MNv4), featuring universally efficient architecture designs for mobile devices. At its core, we introduce the Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) search block, a unified and flexible structure that merges Inverted Bottleneck (IB), ConvNext, Feed Forward Network (FFN), and a novel Extra Depthwise (ExtraDW) variant. Alongside UIB, we present Mobile MQA, an attention block tailored for mobile accelerators, delivering a significant 39% speedup. An optimized neural architecture search (NAS) recipe is also introduced which improves MNv4 search effectiveness. The integration of UIB, Mobile MQA and the refined NAS recipe results in a new suite of MNv4 models that are mostly Pareto optimal across mobile CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, as well as specialized accelerators like Apple Neural Engine and Google Pixel EdgeTPU - a characteristic not found in any other models tested. Finally, to further boost accuracy, we introduce a novel distillation technique. Enhanced by this technique, our MNv4-Hybrid-Large model delivers 87% ImageNet-1K accuracy, with a Pixel 8 EdgeTPU runtime of just 3.8ms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-16\n\n\n\n#### 6. Unifying Deep Local and Global Features for Image Search\n\n*From Search Query: attention integration techniques*\n\n*Andre Araujo, Jack Sim, Bingyi Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Image retrieval is the problem of searching an image database for items that are similar to a query image. To address this task, two main types of image representations have been studied: global and local image features. In this work, our key contribution is to unify global and local features into a single deep model, enabling accurate retrieval with efficient feature extraction. We refer to the new model as DELG, standing for DEep Local and Global features. We leverage lessons from recent feature learning work and propose a model that combines generalized mean pooling for global features and attentive selection for local features. The entire network can be learned end-to-end by carefully balancing the gradient flow between two heads -- requiring only image-level labels. We also introduce an autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction technique for local features, which is integrated into the model, improving training efficiency and matching performance. Comprehensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art image retrieval on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets, and state-of-the-art single-model instance-level recognition on the Google Landmarks dataset v2.

SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and augment their representations using attention modules. This hybrid approach extends accurate predictions to context lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\nThis work proposes a hybrid architecture that combines sparse and dense attention. The approach shards the context heterogeneously among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. This design achieves significant speed-ups (2.5X in training and 4.5X in inference) compared to dense attention baselines, while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks and long-context retrieval.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Sequence Handling\n\n### Taipan and Mamba-2\nTaipan leverages the constant memory usage of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba-2, which is beneficial for handling long sequences without the quadratic computational complexity and linearly scaling memory costs associated with traditional Transformers.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nThe work on hardware-aware context sharding among attention heads introduces a sparse attention architecture that reduces memory usage and computational costs. By sharding the context heterogeneously, the model achieves efficient memory IO and high parallelization, leading to substantial speed-ups without compromising performance.\n\n## Attention Integration Techniques\n\n### Selective Attention Layers (SALs)\nIn the Taipan architecture, SALs integrate with Mamba-2 to selectively focus on tokens that require long-range interactions. This integration enhances the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently while maintaining the expressiveness of the model.\n\n### Hybrid Sparse and Dense Attention\nThe hybrid architecture proposed in the context sharding work combines sparse and dense attention mechanisms. This integration allows the model to benefit from the efficiency of sparse attention while leveraging the performance of dense attention, particularly in layers where direct access to all tokens is necessary.\n\n## Performance Comparisons and Efficiency\n\n### Training and Inference Speed-Up\nThe hybrid architecture in the context sharding work achieves a 2.5X training speed-up and a 4.5X inference speed-up compared to dense attention baselines. Additionally, it extends the context length to 128k tokens for 7B models, demonstrating strong performance on long-context tasks.\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Computational Benefits\nTaipan's use of SALs and Mamba-2 ensures constant memory usage, making it more memory-efficient than traditional Transformers. The sparse attention mechanisms also reduce the computational complexity, leading to significant speed-ups in both training and inference.\n\nThese findings and implementations highlight the potential of hybrid attention architectures in improving the efficiency, expressiveness, and scalability of autoregressive language models, particularly in handling long sequences and maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks.\n",

Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode.

These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. The Neural Data Router: Adaptive Control Flow in Transformers Improves Systematic Generalization  (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*R. Csord\u00e1s, Kazuki Irie, J.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths.

Finally, many algorithmic tasks require combining several local computations in the right order. This typically implies that attention should not focus on all possible matches at a given time but only on the closest match. We propose and investigate a new type of attention with a corresponding inductive bias called geometric attention (Sec.2.2. Using both the geometric attention and copy gate, our model implements a \"neural data routing mechanism\", which can adaptively serialize the input problem. We refer to the resulting new Transformer as Neural Data Router (NDR). In the experimental section (Sec.3), we evaluate this model on three algorithmic tasks requiring length generalization and demonstrate its effectiveness. ### 2.1 Copy Gate: LEARNING TO SKIP OPERATIONS (VERTICAL Flow)\n\nEach layer of the regular Transformer consists of one self-attention and one feedforward block. The input to each of these blocks is directly connected to the corresponding output via a residual connection (Srivastava et al. 2015, He et al. 2016. However, such a connection does not allow for skipping the transformation of the entire layer and simply passing the unchanged input to the next layer. Here we propose to add an explicit gate, which we call copy gate, to facilitate such a behavior. We consider a $T$-layer Transformer encoder and an input sequence of length $N$. Since each layer corresponds to one computational step, we often refer to a layer as a step $t$. We denote the Transformer state of column $i$ in layer $t$ as $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}=\\mathbf{H}_{t, i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ where $d$ is the state size, and $\\mathbf{H}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ denotes the states of all $N$ columns in layer $t$. In the copy gate-augmented Transformer (Figure 5 in the appendix), each column $i$ in layer $(t+1)$ processes the input $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$ similarly to regular Transformers:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}=\\text { LayerNorm(MultiHeadAttention }\\left(\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}, \\mathbf{H}_{t}, \\mathbf{H}_{t}\\right)+\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\boldsymbol{u}^{(i, t+1)}=\\operatorname{LayerNorm}\\left(\\operatorname{FFN}^{\\text {data }}\\left(\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nusing the standard multi-head attention operation (Vaswani et al. 2017) MultiHeadAttention with a query obtained from $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}$ and keys/values from $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$, but the output is gated (using $\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{FFN}^{\\mathrm{gate}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t+1)}=\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)} \\odot \\boldsymbol{u}^{(i, t+1)}+\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)}\\right) \\odot \\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe use the basic two-layer feedforward block (Vaswani et al. 2017) for both FFN ${ }^{\\text {data }}$ and FFN ${ }^{\\text {gate }}$ which transforms input $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{FFN}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\boldsymbol{W}_{2} \\max \\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{1} \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{b}_{1}, 0\\right)+\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}\n$$\n\nbut with separate parameters and different dimensionalities: for FFN ${ }^{\\text {data }} \\boldsymbol{W}_{1}^{\\text {data }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{FF}} \\times d}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{2}^{\\text {data }} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_{\\mathrm{FF}}}$, while for $\\mathrm{FFN}^{\\text {gate }} \\boldsymbol{W}_{1}^{\\text {gate }}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{2}^{\\text {gate }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, with biases $\\boldsymbol{b}_{1}^{\\text {data }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{FF}}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {data }}, \\boldsymbol{b}_{1}^{\\text {gate }}, \\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {gate }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. When the gate is closed i.e. $g^{(i, t+1)}=0$ in Eq. 4 the entire transformation is skipped and the input is copied over to the next layer $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t+1)}=\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}$. Crucially, we parameterize the gate (Eq. 3 ) as a function of the output of the self-attention (Eq. 11, such that the decision to copy or transform the input for each column depends on the states of all columns. This is a crucial difference compared to previously proposed gatings in Transformers, which are solely motivated by training stability (Parisotto et al., 2020) or by a common practice from convolution-based models (Chaabouni et al., 2021). None of the previous approaches can implement the behavior of our copy gate (see Sec. 6 on related work). The bias of the gate $\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {gate }}$ is initialized to -3 (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/47 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nThe situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns.

Our code is public $1^{1}$\n\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nNeural networks (NNs) may easily learn certain training sets, but typically they do not generalize on systematically different test sets. Examples of systematic generalization (Fodor et al, 1988)\ninclude generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training-productivity, and algorithmic combinations of previously learned rules-systematicity. Despite recent efforts (Bahdanau et al., 2019, Korrel et al. 2019, Lake, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Russin et al., 2019, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2021), systematic generalization generally remains unsolved (Fodor \\& McLaughlin, 1990, Lake \\& Baroni, 2018, Liska et al., 2018, Greff et al., 2020, Hupkes et al., 2020). On some datasets, the best performing models are neuro-symbolic hybrids (Chen et al.| 2020, Liu et al. 2020) using task-specific symbolic functions. However, their applicability to other datasets remains limited (Furrer et al. 2020, Shaw et al., 2020). A big question is: which type of architectural inductive bias encourages the training process to select \"good\" solutions which generalize systematically? The popular Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) also often fail to generalize on algorithmic tasks (e.g. Liska et al. (2018); Dubois et al. (2020); Chaabouni et al. (2021); Csord\u00e1s et al. (2021); Onta\u00f1\u00f3n et al.(2021)), even on tasks with intuitive solutions that can be simply expressed in terms of Transformer attention patterns. Given an input sequence of length $N$ and a Transformer encoder of depth $T$, solving an algorithmic task is often all about routing the relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the $T$-by- $N$ grid represented by Transformer columns (illustrated in Figure 11(Left). Effectively the task is to learn to draw an adaptive control flow on the canvas of Transformer columns. In fact, recent work by Weiss et al. (2021) introduced a programming language called RASP, which is specifically designed to express solutions to sequence processing problems, and which has a direct equivalent to the operations in Transformer encoders. However, it is shown that Transformers learn solutions expressed in RASP only through intermediate supervision of attention patterns, and sometimes, even such supervision fails. Generally speaking, Transformers fail to find easily interpretable and/or symbolic solutions to algorithmic tasks. We conversely hypothesize that attention-based NNs that are able to find intuitive solutions (achieving interpretable attention patterns) could improve systematic generalization. [^0]Here we point out that regular Transformers lack some basic ingredients for learning such \"intuitive\" solutions to algorithmic problems. As a remedy, we propose simple architectural modifications to help them learn data routing. As a first step towards validating our model, we focus on the popular length generalization task of compositional table lookup (CTL; Liska et al. (2018); Hupkes et al. (2019); Dubois et al. (2020), as well as two more complex tasks: a simple arithmetic task and a variant of ListOps (Nangia \\& Bowman, 2018) designed to test the compositional generalization ability of NNs. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100\\% generalization accuracy (never reported before; Dubois et al. (2020)) on the CTL task, and obtains nearly perfect accuracy on both the proposed simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks. We show that the attention and gating patterns of NDR tend to be interpretable as plausible control flows. ## 2 Improving Transformers FOR LEARning Adaptive Control Flow\n\nWe argue that the following components are needed to build Transformers capable of learning adaptive control flow. First, composing known operations in an arbitrary order requires that all operations are available at every computational step. This can be easily achieved by sharing the weights of the layers, as is done in Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al. 2019). Second, the network should be sufficiently deep, at least as deep as the deepest data dependency in the computational graph built from elementary operations (e.g., in the case of a parse tree, this is the depth of the tree). Otherwise, multiple operations must be fused into a single layer and hinder natural and elegant compositions. Third, inputs in some columns should be kept unchanged until it is their turn to be processed. The regular Transformer lacks a mechanism for skipping the whole transformation step by simply copying the input to the next step/layer. We propose a special gating function, copy gate, to implement such a mechanism (Sec.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/47 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\n4\nDifferent heads seem to specialize in different functions. As already mentioned in Sec. 4 , head 13 of the NDR architecture, shown in Figure 13, seems to specialize in selecting which arguments belong to which operator. The gating patterns are also very interesting. In the early stages, the deepest parts of the input are updated: [MAX 22 tree that can be processed in parallel. In the following steps, the update patterns spread up in the parse tree, updating the operations that have their arguments available. In this task, the input is read from the first column, which is written in a very late stage.

Score: 0.24)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms hybrid architectures*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Learning Robust Dynamics through Variational Sparse Gating\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms hybrid architectures*\n\n*A. Jain, Shivakanth Sujit, S.

World models have previously been shown to improve sample-efficiency in simulated environments with few objects, but have not yet been applied successfully to environments with many objects. In environments with many objects, often only a small number of them are moving or interacting at the same time. In this paper, we investigate integrating this inductive bias of sparse interactions into the latent dynamics of world models trained from pixels. First, we introduce Variational Sparse Gating (VSG), a latent dynamics model that updates its feature dimensions sparsely through stochastic binary gates. Moreover, we propose a simplified architecture Simple Variational Sparse Gating (SVSG) that removes the deterministic pathway of previous models, resulting in a fully stochastic transition function that leverages the VSG mechanism. We evaluate the two model architectures in the BringBackShapes (BBS) environment that features a large number of moving objects and partial observability, demonstrating clear improvements over prior models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms hybrid architectures*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. CHAMMI: A benchmark for channel-adaptive models in microscopy imaging\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation techniques*\n\n*Zitong S. Chen, Chau Pham, Siqi Wang, Michael Doron, Nikita Moshkov, Bryan A. Plummer, Juan C. Caicedo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a benchmark for investigating channel-adaptive models in microscopy imaging, which consists of a dataset of varied-channel single-cell images, and a biologically relevant evaluation framework, and adapted several existing techniques to create channel- Adaptive models.\n\n**Abstract:** Most neural networks assume that input images have a fixed number of channels (three for RGB images). However, there are many settings where the number of channels may vary, such as microscopy images where the number of channels changes depending on instruments and experimental goals. Yet, there has not been a systemic attempt to create and evaluate neural networks that are invariant to the number and type of channels. As a result, trained models remain specific to individual studies and are hardly reusable for other microscopy settings. In this paper, we present a benchmark for investigating channel-adaptive models in microscopy imaging, which consists of 1) a dataset of varied-channel single-cell images, and 2) a biologically relevant evaluation framework. In addition, we adapted several existing techniques to create channel-adaptive models and compared their performance on this benchmark to fixed-channel, baseline models. We find that channel-adaptive models can generalize better to out-of-domain tasks and can be computationally efficient. We contribute a curated dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7988357) and an evaluation API (https://github.com/broadinstitute/MorphEm.git) to facilitate objective comparisons in future research and applications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation techniques*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Hwijeen Ahn, W. Neiswanger, Pengtao Xie, Emma Strubell, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Multi-Epoch Matrix Factorization Mechanisms for Private Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation techniques*\n\n*Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, H. B. McMahan, Keith Rush, Abhradeep Thakurta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes the problem of DP mechanisms for adaptive streams with multiple participations and introduces a non-trivial extension of online matrix factorization DP mechanisms to the authors' setting, establishing the necessary theory for sensitivity calculations and efficient computation of optimal matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce new differentially private (DP) mechanisms for gradient-based machine learning (ML) with multiple passes (epochs) over a dataset, substantially improving the achievable privacy-utility-computation tradeoffs. We formalize the problem of DP mechanisms for adaptive streams with multiple participations and introduce a non-trivial extension of online matrix factorization DP mechanisms to our setting. This includes establishing the necessary theory for sensitivity calculations and efficient computation of optimal matrices. For some applications like $>\\!\\! 10,000$ SGD steps, applying these optimal techniques becomes computationally expensive. We thus design an efficient Fourier-transform-based mechanism with only a minor utility loss. Extensive empirical evaluation on both example-level DP for image classification and user-level DP for language modeling demonstrate substantial improvements over all previous methods, including the widely-used DP-SGD . Though our primary application is to ML, our main DP results are applicable to arbitrary linear queries and hence may have much broader applicability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. Transformers are uninterpretable with myopic methods: a case study with bounded Dyck grammars\n\n*From Search Query: attention pattern combination*\n\n*Kaiyue Wen, Yuchen Li, Bing Liu, Andrej Risteski*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work takes a critical view of methods that exclusively focus on individual parts of the model, rather than consider the network as a whole, and shows that the set of optima is qualitatively rich; in particular, the attention pattern of a single layer can be ``nearly randomized'', while preserving the functionality of the network.\n\n**Abstract:** Interpretability methods aim to understand the algorithm implemented by a trained model (e.g., a Transofmer) by examining various aspects of the model, such as the weight matrices or the attention patterns. In this work, through a combination of theoretical results and carefully controlled experiments on synthetic data, we take a critical view of methods that exclusively focus on individual parts of the model, rather than consider the network as a whole. We consider a simple synthetic setup of learning a (bounded) Dyck language. Theoretically, we show that the set of models that (exactly or approximately) solve this task satisfy a structural characterization derived from ideas in formal languages (the pumping lemma). We use this characterization to show that the set of optima is qualitatively rich; in particular, the attention pattern of a single layer can be ``nearly randomized'', while preserving the functionality of the network. We also show via extensive experiments that these constructions are not merely a theoretical artifact: even after severely constraining the architecture of the model, vastly different solutions can be reached via standard training. Thus, interpretability claims based on inspecting individual heads or weight matrices in the Transformer can be misleading.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: attention pattern combination*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

We show that particles, representing tokens, tend to cluster toward particular limiting objects as time tends to infinity. Cluster locations are determined by the initial tokens, confirming context-awareness of representations learned by Transformers. Using techniques from dynamical systems and partial differential equations, we show that the type of limiting object that emerges depends on the spectrum of the value matrix. Additionally, in the one-dimensional case we prove that the self-attention matrix converges to a low-rank Boolean matrix. The combination of these results mathematically confirms the empirical observation made by Vaswani et al.

Bosonic Qiskit\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms hybrid architectures*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The practical benefits of hybrid quantum information processing hardware that contains continuous-variable objects (bosonic modes such as mechanical or electromagnetic oscillators) in addition to traditional (discrete-variable) qubits have recently been demonstrated by experiments with bosonic codes that reach the break-even point for quantum error correction and by efficient Gaussian boson sampling simulation of the Franck-Condon spectra of triatomic molecules that is well beyond the capabilities of current qubit-only hardware. The goal of this Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA) project is to develop an instruction set architecture (ISA) for hybrid qubit/bosonic mode systems that contains an inventory of the fundamental operations and measurements that are possible in such hardware. The corresponding abstract machine model (AMM) would also contain a description of the appropriate error models associated with the gates, measurements and time evolution of the hardware. This information has been implemented as an extension of Qiskit. Qiskit is an opensource software development toolkit (SDK) for simulating the quantum state of a quantum circuit on a system with Python 3.7+ and for running the same circuits on prototype hardware within the IBM Quantum Lab. We introduce the Bosonic Qiskit software to enable the simulation of hybrid qubit/bosonic systems using the existing Qiskit software development kit. This implementation can be used for simulating new hybrid systems, verifying proposed physical systems, and modeling systems larger than can currently be constructed. We also cover tutorials and example use cases included within the software to study Jaynes- Cummings models, bosonic Hubbard models, plotting Wigner functions and animations, and calculating maximum likelihood estimations using Wigner functions.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation techniques*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Regularized Zero-Forcing Beamforming in Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation techniques*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern wireless cellular networks use massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. This technology involves operations with an antenna array at a base station that simultaneously serves multiple mobile devices which also use multiple antennas on their side. For this, various precoding and detection techniques are used, allowing each user to receive the signal intended for him from the base station. There is an important class of linear precoding called Regularized Zero-Forcing (RZF). In this work, we propose Adaptive RZF (ARZF) with a special kind of regularization matrix with different coefficients for each layer of multi-antenna users. These regularization coefficients are defined by explicit formulas based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of user channel matrices. We study the optimization problem, which is solved by the proposed algorithm, with the connection to other possible problem statements. We prove theoretical estimates of the number of conditionality of the inverse covariance matrix of the ARZF method and the standard RZF method, which is important for systems with fixed computational accuracy. Finally, We compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art linear precoding algorithms on simulations with the Quadriga channel model. The proposed approach provides a significant increase in quality with the same computation time as in the reference methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 5. Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: attention pattern combination*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: attention pattern combination*\n\n*Anton Peganov, Yuri Kuratov, Grigory V. Sapunov, Mikhail S. Burtsev*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. The self-attention architecture allows transformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, information about the context is stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. This might limit the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3) controlling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively correlates with the model performance for machine translation and language modelling tasks. Augmentation of pre-trained masked language model with memory tokens shows mixed results for tasks from GLUE benchmark. Visualization of attention patterns over the memory suggest that it improves the model's ability to process a global context.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design, particularly focusing on gating mechanisms in hybrid architectures, combining different attention patterns adaptively, and incorporating adaptive computation and dynamic routing, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in Hybrid Architectures\n\nGating mechanisms are crucial in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and can be adapted in hybrid architectures to manage the flow of information effectively.\n\n- **LSTMs and GRUs**: These models use gating mechanisms to regulate the memory cell and hidden state updates. For example, LSTMs employ input, forget, and output gates, while GRUs use update and reset gates. These mechanisms can be integrated into hybrid architectures to handle sequential data efficiently.\n\n## Combining Attention Patterns Adaptively\n\n- **Short-Long Convolutions with Linear Attention**: Hybrid models like CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention) combine structured patterns (convolutions) with data-dependent selection (linear attention). This approach allows for global abstraction and data-dependent selection, maintaining real linear complexity. Such hybrid architectures can adaptively switch between different attention mechanisms based on input characteristics[Analysis Note].\n\n## Adaptive Computation and Dynamic Routing\n\n- **Dynamic Routing in Attention Mechanisms**: In the context of attention mechanisms, dynamic routing can be achieved by adaptively weighting different attention heads or mechanisms based on the input. For instance, models can use learnable weights to combine the outputs of different attention mechanisms, such as self-attention and convolutional attention. This adaptive weighting can be learned during training to optimize the model's performance for various input characteristics.\n  \n  - **Example from Transformer Architectures**: In Transformer models, multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This can be seen as a form of dynamic routing where the model learns to weight different attention heads differently based on the input[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approaches\n\nWhile not directly related to traditional LM architectures, hybrid quantum-classical models can provide insights into adaptive computation and dynamic routing:\n\n- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks**: These models integrate quantum circuits with classical neural networks. The quantum layer can act as a feature extractor, and the output is fed into a classical neural network. The use of parameterized quantum gates and entanglement operations can be seen as a form of adaptive computation, where the quantum circuit adapts to the input data by applying different rotations and entanglements based on the learnable weights.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Memory Management and Efficiency**: When implementing hybrid architectures, it is crucial to consider memory management and computational efficiency. Techniques such as tiling strategies, IO-aware implementations, and divide-and-conquer approaches for linear attention can significantly improve the model's efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Adaptive Attention Mechanisms**: Future research could focus on developing adaptive attention mechanisms that can dynamically switch between different types of attention (e.g., self-attention, convolutional attention) based on the input characteristics. This could involve learning weights or gates that control the flow of information between different attention mechanisms.\n  \n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Integrating hardware-aware optimizations, such as those used in CHELA and Lightning Attention-2, can help in achieving real performance gains by minimizing memory access overhead and optimizing computational resources[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop more efficient and adaptive autoregressive LM blocks that leverage the strengths of different attention mechanisms and gating strategies, while also optimizing for computational efficiency and memory management.\n",

Finally, many algorithmic tasks require combining several local computations in the right order. This typically implies that attention should not focus on all possible matches at a given time but only on the closest match. We propose and investigate a new type of attention with a corresponding inductive bias called geometric attention (Sec.2.2. Using both the geometric attention and copy gate, our model implements a \"neural data routing mechanism\", which can adaptively serialize the input problem. We refer to the resulting new Transformer as Neural Data Router (NDR). In the experimental section (Sec.3), we evaluate this model on three algorithmic tasks requiring length generalization and demonstrate its effectiveness. ### 2.1 Copy Gate: LEARNING TO SKIP OPERATIONS (VERTICAL Flow)\n\nEach layer of the regular Transformer consists of one self-attention and one feedforward block. The input to each of these blocks is directly connected to the corresponding output via a residual connection (Srivastava et al. 2015, He et al. 2016. However, such a connection does not allow for skipping the transformation of the entire layer and simply passing the unchanged input to the next layer. Here we propose to add an explicit gate, which we call copy gate, to facilitate such a behavior. We consider a $T$-layer Transformer encoder and an input sequence of length $N$. Since each layer corresponds to one computational step, we often refer to a layer as a step $t$. We denote the Transformer state of column $i$ in layer $t$ as $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}=\\mathbf{H}_{t, i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ where $d$ is the state size, and $\\mathbf{H}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ denotes the states of all $N$ columns in layer $t$. In the copy gate-augmented Transformer (Figure 5 in the appendix), each column $i$ in layer $(t+1)$ processes the input $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$ similarly to regular Transformers:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}=\\text { LayerNorm(MultiHeadAttention }\\left(\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}, \\mathbf{H}_{t}, \\mathbf{H}_{t}\\right)+\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\boldsymbol{u}^{(i, t+1)}=\\operatorname{LayerNorm}\\left(\\operatorname{FFN}^{\\text {data }}\\left(\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nusing the standard multi-head attention operation (Vaswani et al. 2017) MultiHeadAttention with a query obtained from $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}$ and keys/values from $\\mathbf{H}_{t}$, but the output is gated (using $\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{FFN}^{\\mathrm{gate}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{a}^{(i, t+1)}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t+1)}=\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)} \\odot \\boldsymbol{u}^{(i, t+1)}+\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{g}^{(i, t+1)}\\right) \\odot \\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe use the basic two-layer feedforward block (Vaswani et al. 2017) for both FFN ${ }^{\\text {data }}$ and FFN ${ }^{\\text {gate }}$ which transforms input $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{FFN}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\boldsymbol{W}_{2} \\max \\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{1} \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{b}_{1}, 0\\right)+\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}\n$$\n\nbut with separate parameters and different dimensionalities: for FFN ${ }^{\\text {data }} \\boldsymbol{W}_{1}^{\\text {data }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{FF}} \\times d}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{2}^{\\text {data }} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_{\\mathrm{FF}}}$, while for $\\mathrm{FFN}^{\\text {gate }} \\boldsymbol{W}_{1}^{\\text {gate }}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{2}^{\\text {gate }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, with biases $\\boldsymbol{b}_{1}^{\\text {data }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{FF}}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {data }}, \\boldsymbol{b}_{1}^{\\text {gate }}, \\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {gate }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. When the gate is closed i.e. $g^{(i, t+1)}=0$ in Eq. 4 the entire transformation is skipped and the input is copied over to the next layer $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t+1)}=\\boldsymbol{h}^{(i, t)}$. Crucially, we parameterize the gate (Eq. 3 ) as a function of the output of the self-attention (Eq. 11, such that the decision to copy or transform the input for each column depends on the states of all columns. This is a crucial difference compared to previously proposed gatings in Transformers, which are solely motivated by training stability (Parisotto et al., 2020) or by a common practice from convolution-based models (Chaabouni et al., 2021). None of the previous approaches can implement the behavior of our copy gate (see Sec. 6 on related work). The bias of the gate $\\boldsymbol{b}_{2}^{\\text {gate }}$ is initialized to -3 (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/47 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nThe situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns.

Our code is public $1^{1}$\n\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nNeural networks (NNs) may easily learn certain training sets, but typically they do not generalize on systematically different test sets. Examples of systematic generalization (Fodor et al, 1988)\ninclude generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training-productivity, and algorithmic combinations of previously learned rules-systematicity. Despite recent efforts (Bahdanau et al., 2019, Korrel et al. 2019, Lake, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Russin et al., 2019, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2021), systematic generalization generally remains unsolved (Fodor \\& McLaughlin, 1990, Lake \\& Baroni, 2018, Liska et al., 2018, Greff et al., 2020, Hupkes et al., 2020). On some datasets, the best performing models are neuro-symbolic hybrids (Chen et al.| 2020, Liu et al. 2020) using task-specific symbolic functions. However, their applicability to other datasets remains limited (Furrer et al. 2020, Shaw et al., 2020). A big question is: which type of architectural inductive bias encourages the training process to select \"good\" solutions which generalize systematically? The popular Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) also often fail to generalize on algorithmic tasks (e.g. Liska et al. (2018); Dubois et al. (2020); Chaabouni et al. (2021); Csord\u00e1s et al. (2021); Onta\u00f1\u00f3n et al.(2021)), even on tasks with intuitive solutions that can be simply expressed in terms of Transformer attention patterns. Given an input sequence of length $N$ and a Transformer encoder of depth $T$, solving an algorithmic task is often all about routing the relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the $T$-by- $N$ grid represented by Transformer columns (illustrated in Figure 11(Left). Effectively the task is to learn to draw an adaptive control flow on the canvas of Transformer columns. In fact, recent work by Weiss et al. (2021) introduced a programming language called RASP, which is specifically designed to express solutions to sequence processing problems, and which has a direct equivalent to the operations in Transformer encoders. However, it is shown that Transformers learn solutions expressed in RASP only through intermediate supervision of attention patterns, and sometimes, even such supervision fails. Generally speaking, Transformers fail to find easily interpretable and/or symbolic solutions to algorithmic tasks. We conversely hypothesize that attention-based NNs that are able to find intuitive solutions (achieving interpretable attention patterns) could improve systematic generalization. [^0]Here we point out that regular Transformers lack some basic ingredients for learning such \"intuitive\" solutions to algorithmic problems. As a remedy, we propose simple architectural modifications to help them learn data routing. As a first step towards validating our model, we focus on the popular length generalization task of compositional table lookup (CTL; Liska et al. (2018); Hupkes et al. (2019); Dubois et al. (2020), as well as two more complex tasks: a simple arithmetic task and a variant of ListOps (Nangia \\& Bowman, 2018) designed to test the compositional generalization ability of NNs. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100\\% generalization accuracy (never reported before; Dubois et al. (2020)) on the CTL task, and obtains nearly perfect accuracy on both the proposed simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks. We show that the attention and gating patterns of NDR tend to be interpretable as plausible control flows. ## 2 Improving Transformers FOR LEARning Adaptive Control Flow\n\nWe argue that the following components are needed to build Transformers capable of learning adaptive control flow. First, composing known operations in an arbitrary order requires that all operations are available at every computational step. This can be easily achieved by sharing the weights of the layers, as is done in Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al. 2019). Second, the network should be sufficiently deep, at least as deep as the deepest data dependency in the computational graph built from elementary operations (e.g., in the case of a parse tree, this is the depth of the tree). Otherwise, multiple operations must be fused into a single layer and hinder natural and elegant compositions. Third, inputs in some columns should be kept unchanged until it is their turn to be processed. The regular Transformer lacks a mechanism for skipping the whole transformation step by simply copying the input to the next step/layer. We propose a special gating function, copy gate, to implement such a mechanism (Sec.\n```\n\n#### 2. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.66)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. Point Transformer V2: Grouped Vector Attention and Partition-based Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Xiaoyang Wu, Yixing Lao, Li Jiang, Xihui Liu, Hengshuang Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a powerful and efficient Point Transformer V2 model with novel designs that overcome the limitations of previous work, and first proposes group vector attention, which is more effective than the previous version of vector attention.\n\n**Abstract:** As a pioneering work exploring transformer architecture for 3D point cloud understanding, Point Transformer achieves impressive results on multiple highly competitive benchmarks. In this work, we analyze the limitations of the Point Transformer and propose our powerful and efficient Point Transformer V2 model with novel designs that overcome the limitations of previous work. In particular, we first propose group vector attention, which is more effective than the previous version of vector attention. Inheriting the advantages of both learnable weight encoding and multi-head attention, we present a highly effective implementation of grouped vector attention with a novel grouped weight encoding layer. We also strengthen the position information for attention by an additional position encoding multiplier. Furthermore, we design novel and lightweight partition-based pooling methods which enable better spatial alignment and more efficient sampling. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves better performance than its predecessor and achieves state-of-the-art on several challenging 3D point cloud understanding benchmarks, including 3D point cloud segmentation on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS and 3D point cloud classification on ModelNet40.

A Copy-Augmented Generative Model for Open-Domain Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: copy gate integration*\n\n*Shuang Liu, Dong Wang, Xiaoguang Li, Minghui Huang, Meizhen Ding*\n\n**TL;DR:** This article proposes a novel copy-augmented generative approach that integrates the merits of both extractive and generative readers and is built upon the powerful generative model FiD (CITATION).\n\n**Abstract:** Open-domain question answering is a challenging task with a wide variety of practical applications. Existing modern approaches mostly follow a standard two-stage paradigm: retriever then reader. In this article, we focus on improving the effectiveness of the reader module and propose a novel copy-augmented generative approach that integrates the merits of both extractive and generative readers. In particular, our model is built upon the powerful generative model FiD (CITATION). We enhance the original generative reader by incorporating a pointer network to encourage the model to directly copy words from the retrieved passages. We conduct experiments on the two benchmark datasets, Natural Questions and TriviaQA, and the empirical results demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed approach.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Gazetteer Integration in Multilingual Models for Cross-Lingual and Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: copy gate integration*\n\n*B. Fetahu, Anjie Fang, Oleg Rokhlenko, S. Malmasi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This novel approach uses a token-level gating layer to augment pre-trained multilingual transformers with gazetteers containing named entities (NE) from a target language or domain to address the NER knowledge gap across languages and domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Named entity recognition (NER) in a real-world setting remains challenging and is impacted by factors like text genre, corpus quality, and data availability. NER models trained on CoNLL do not transfer well to other domains, even within the same language. This is especially the case for multi-lingual models when applied to low-resource languages, and is mainly due to missing entity information. We propose an approach that with limited effort and data, addresses the NER knowledge gap across languages and domains. Our novel approach uses a token-level gating layer to augment pre-trained multilingual transformers with gazetteers containing named entities (NE) from a target language or domain.This approach provides the flexibility to jointly integrate both textual and gazetteer information dynamically: entity knowledge from gazetteers is used only when a token\u2019s textual representation is insufficient for the NER task.Evaluation on several languages and domains demonstrates: (i) a high mismatch of reported NER performance on CoNLL vs. domain specific datasets, (ii) gazetteers significantly improve NER performance across languages and domains, and (iii) gazetteers can be flexibly incorporated to guide knowledge transfer. On cross-lingual transfer we achieve an improvement over the baseline with F1=+17.6%, and with F1=+21.3% for cross-domain transfer.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Generating Informative Conversational Response using Recurrent Knowledge-Interaction and Knowledge-Copy\n\n*From Search Query: copy gate integration*\n\n*X. Lin, Weiyu Jian, Jianshan He, Taifeng Wang, Wei Chu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a method that uses recurrent knowledge interaction among response decoding steps to incorporate appropriate knowledge and introduces a knowledge copy mechanism using a knowledge-aware pointer network to copy words from external knowledge according to knowledge attention distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge-driven conversation approaches have achieved remarkable research attention recently. However, generating an informative response with multiple relevant knowledge without losing fluency and coherence is still one of the main challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method that uses recurrent knowledge interaction among response decoding steps to incorporate appropriate knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge copy mechanism using a knowledge-aware pointer network to copy words from external knowledge according to knowledge attention distribution. Our joint neural conversation model which integrates recurrent Knowledge-Interaction and knowledge Copy (KIC) performs well on generating informative responses. Experiments demonstrate that our model with fewer parameters yields significant improvements over competitive baselines on two datasets Wizard-of-Wikipedia(average Bleu +87%; abs.: 0.034) and DuConv(average Bleu +20%; abs.: 0.047)) with different knowledge formats (textual & structured) and different languages (English & Chinese).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 50  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. Learning to Iteratively Solve Routing Problems with Dual-Aspect Collaborative Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: neural routing efficiency*\n\n*Yining Ma, Jingwen Li, Zhiguang Cao, Wen Song, Le Zhang, Zhenghua Chen, Jing Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel Dual-Aspect Collaborative Transformer to learn embeddings for the node and positional features separately, instead of fusing them together as done in existing ones, so as to avoid potential noises and incompatible correlations.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer has become a prevailing deep architecture for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs). However, it is less effective in learning improvement models for VRP because its positional encoding (PE) method is not suitable in representing VRP solutions. This paper presents a novel Dual-Aspect Collaborative Transformer (DACT) to learn embeddings for the node and positional features separately, instead of fusing them together as done in existing ones, so as to avoid potential noises and incompatible correlations. Moreover, the positional features are embedded through a novel cyclic positional encoding (CPE) method to allow Transformer to effectively capture the circularity and symmetry of VRP solutions (i.e., cyclic sequences). We train DACT using Proximal Policy Optimization and design a curriculum learning strategy for better sample efficiency. We apply DACT to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Results show that our DACT outperforms existing Transformer based improvement models, and exhibits much better generalization performance across different problem sizes on synthetic and benchmark instances, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 96  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 8. Multi-Head Adapter Routing for Cross-Task Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: neural routing efficiency*\n\n*Lucas Caccia, E. Ponti, Zhan Su, Matheus Pereira, Nicolas Le Roux, Alessandro Sordoni*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that routing is most beneficial during multi-task pre-training rather than during few-shot adaptation, and Multi-Head Routing is proposed, which discards routing and fine-tunes the average of the pre-trained adapters on each downstream tasks as an effective method for single-adapter fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for cross-task generalization consists in pre-training adapters on a multi-task training set before few-shot adaptation to test tasks. Polytropon [Ponti et al., 2023] ($\\texttt{Poly}$) jointly learns an inventory of adapters and a routing function that selects a (variable-size) subset of adapters for each task during both pre-training and few-shot adaptation. In this paper, we investigate the role that adapter routing plays in its success and design new variants based on our findings. First, we build on the intuition that finer-grained routing provides more expressivity. Hence, we propose $\\texttt{MHR}$ (Multi-Head Routing) which combines subsets of adapter parameters and outperforms $\\texttt{Poly}$ under a comparable parameter budget; by only fine-tuning the routing function and not the adapters ($\\texttt{MHR}$-$z$) we achieve competitive performance with extreme parameter efficiency. Second, we find that $\\texttt{Poly}$/$\\texttt{MHR}$ performance is a result of better multi-task optimization, rather than modular inductive biases that facilitate adapter recombination and local adaptation, as previously hypothesized. In fact, we find that $\\texttt{MHR}$ exhibits high gradient alignment between training tasks. We find that routing is most beneficial during multi-task pre-training rather than during few-shot adaptation and propose $\\texttt{MHR}$-$\\mu$, which discards routing and fine-tunes the average of the pre-trained adapters on each downstream tasks. This establishes $\\texttt{MHR}$-$\\mu$ as an effective method for single-adapter fine-tuning. We also show that $\\texttt{MHR}$-$\\mu$ can be used as an effective zero-shot transfer method by training the average of the pre-trained adapters for a few additional steps on the multi-task training set: this yields gains up to 3% on absolute accuracy w.r.t. the baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Losses Can Be Blessings: Routing Self-Supervised Speech Representations Towards Efficient Multilingual and Multitask Speech Processing\n\n*From Search Query: neural routing efficiency*\n\n*Yonggan Fu, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, Zhifan Ye, Zhongzhi Yu, Cheng-I Lai, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via the proposed S3-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speechSSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuned on downstream speech processing tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning (SSL) for rich speech representations has achieved empirical success in low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other speech processing tasks, which can mitigate the necessity of a large amount of transcribed speech and thus has driven a growing demand for on-device ASR and other speech processing. However, advanced speech SSL models have become increasingly large, which contradicts the limited on-device resources. This gap could be more severe in multilingual/multitask scenarios requiring simultaneously recognizing multiple languages or executing multiple speech processing tasks. Additionally, strongly overparameterized speech SSL models tend to suffer from overfitting when being finetuned on low-resource speech corpus. This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via our proposed S$^3$-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10\\% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speech SSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuning on downstream speech processing tasks. More importantly, S$^3$-Router can serve as an all-in-one technique to enable (1) a new finetuning scheme, (2) an efficient multilingual/multitask solution, (3) a state-of-the-art ASR pruning technique, and (4) a new tool to quantitatively analyze the learned speech representation. We believe S$^3$-Router has provided a new perspective for practical deployment of speech SSL models.

TorchDrug: A Powerful and Flexible Machine Learning Platform for Drug Discovery\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Jian Tang, Meng Qu, Louis-Pascal Xhonneux, Runcheng Liu, Chang Ma, Jiarui Lu, Huiyu Cai, Junkun Chen, Yangtian Zhang, Xinyu Yuan, Minghao Xu, Shengchao Liu, Zuobai Zhang, Chence Shi, Zhaocheng Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning has huge potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and is attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, lacking domain knowledge (e.g., which tasks to work on), standard benchmarks and data preprocessing pipelines are the main obstacles for machine learning researchers to work in this domain. To facilitate the progress of machine learning for drug discovery, we develop TorchDrug, a powerful and flexible machine learning platform for drug discovery built on top of PyTorch. TorchDrug benchmarks a variety of important tasks in drug discovery, including molecular property prediction, pretrained molecular representations, de novo molecular design and optimization, retrosynthsis prediction, and biomedical knowledge graph reasoning. State-of-the-art techniques based on geometric deep learning (or graph machine learning), deep generative models, reinforcement learning and knowledge graph reasoning are implemented for these tasks. TorchDrug features a hierarchical interface that facilitates customization from both novices and experts in this domain.

Multi-Modal Temporal Attention Models for Crop Mapping from Satellite Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Nesrine Chehata, Loic Landrieu, Vivien Sainte Fare Garnot*\n\n**Abstract:** Optical and radar satellite time series are synergetic: optical images contain rich spectral information, while C-band radar captures useful geometrical information and is immune to cloud cover. Motivated by the recent success of temporal attention-based methods across multiple crop mapping tasks, we propose to investigate how these models can be adapted to operate on several modalities. We implement and evaluate multiple fusion schemes, including a novel approach and simple adjustments to the training procedure, significantly improving performance and efficiency with little added complexity. We show that most fusion schemes have advantages and drawbacks, making them relevant for specific settings. We then evaluate the benefit of multimodality across several tasks: parcel classification, pixel-based segmentation, and panoptic parcel segmentation. We show that by leveraging both optical and radar time series, multimodal temporal attention-based models can outmatch single-modality models in terms of performance and resilience to cloud cover. To conduct these experiments, we augment the PASTIS dataset with spatially aligned radar image time series. The resulting dataset, PASTIS-R, constitutes the first large-scale, multimodal, and open-access satellite time series dataset with semantic and instance annotations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. MoE++: Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Methods with Zero-Computation Experts\n\n*From Search Query: copy gate integration*\n\n*Shuicheng Yan, Li Yuan, Bo Zhu, Peng Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we aim to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods. To achieve this, we propose MoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both Feed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we introduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace operations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low Computing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within vanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs, be adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High Performance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++ allows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater performance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that zero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all zero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed across different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each token to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the appropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++ achieves better performance while delivering 1.1-2.1x expert forward throughput compared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation for developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Two-Stage Copy-Move Forgery Detection with Self Deep Matching and Proposal SuperGlue\n\n*From Search Query: copy gate integration*\n\n*Shengwei Xu, Xiaobin Zhu, Chao Xia, Yaqi Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Copy-move forgery detection identifies a tampered image by detecting pasted and source regions in the same image. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework specially for copy-move forgery detection. The first stage is a backbone self deep matching network, and the second stage is named as Proposal SuperGlue. In the first stage, atrous convolution and skip matching are incorporated to enrich spatial information and leverage hierarchical features. Spatial attention is built on self-correlation to reinforce the ability to find appearance similar regions. In the second stage, Proposal SuperGlue is proposed to remove false-alarmed regions and remedy incomplete regions. Specifically, a proposal selection strategy is designed to enclose highly suspected regions based on proposal generation and backbone score maps. Then, pairwise matching is conducted among candidate proposals by deep learning based keypoint extraction and matching, i.e., SuperPoint and SuperGlue. Integrated score map generation and refinement methods are designed to integrate results of both stages and obtain optimized results. Our two-stage framework unifies end-to-end deep matching and keypoint matching by obtaining highly suspected proposals, and opens a new gate for deep learning research in copy-move forgery detection. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage framework.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. The Tree Ensemble Layer: Differentiability meets Conditional Computation\n\n*From Search Query: neural routing efficiency*\n\n*Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder, Petros Mol, Zhenyu Tan, Hussein Hazimeh*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks and tree ensembles are state-of-the-art learners, each with its unique statistical and computational advantages. We aim to combine these advantages by introducing a new layer for neural networks, composed of an ensemble of differentiable decision trees (a.k.a. soft trees). While differentiable trees demonstrate promising results in the literature, they are typically slow in training and inference as they do not support conditional computation. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new sparse activation function for sample routing, and implement true conditional computation by developing specialized forward and backward propagation algorithms that exploit sparsity. Our efficient algorithms pave the way for jointly training over deep and wide tree ensembles using first-order methods (e.g., SGD). Experiments on 23 classification datasets indicate over 10x speed-ups compared to the differentiable trees used in the literature and over 20x reduction in the number of parameters compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining competitive performance. Moreover, experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST indicate that replacing dense layers in CNNs with our tree layer reduces the test loss by 7-53% and the number of parameters by 8x. We provide an open-source TensorFlow implementation with a Keras API.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-18\n\n\n\n#### 6. Think2Drive: Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Thinking in Latent World Model for Quasi-Realistic Autonomous Driving (in CARLA-v2)\n\n*From Search Query: neural routing efficiency*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world autonomous driving (AD) especially urban driving involves many corner cases. The lately released AD simulator CARLA v2 adds 39 common events in the driving scene, and provide more quasi-realistic testbed compared to CARLA v1. It poses new challenge to the community and so far no literature has reported any success on the new scenarios in V2 as existing works mostly have to rely on specific rules for planning yet they cannot cover the more complex cases in CARLA v2. In this work, we take the initiative of directly training a planner and the hope is to handle the corner cases flexibly and effectively, which we believe is also the future of AD. To our best knowledge, we develop the first model-based RL method named Think2Drive for AD, with a world model to learn the transitions of the environment, and then it acts as a neural simulator to train the planner. This paradigm significantly boosts the training efficiency due to the low dimensional state space and parallel computing of tensors in the world model. As a result, Think2Drive is able to run in an expert-level proficiency in CARLA v2 within 3 days of training on a single A6000 GPU, and to our best knowledge, so far there is no reported success (100\\% route completion)on CARLA v2. We also propose CornerCase-Repository, a benchmark that supports the evaluation of driving models by scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new and balanced metric to evaluate the performance by route completion, infraction number, and scenario density, so that the driving score could give more information about the actual driving performance.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using geometric attention mechanisms, copy gates, and efficient neural routing, here are some key insights and implementations from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n## Geometric Attention Implementation\n\nGeometric attention can be seen as a neural data routing mechanism that adaptively serializes the input problem. This approach is particularly useful in focusing information flow and improving efficiency.\n\n- In the context of graph transformers, the \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" (Cluster-GT) uses a node-to-cluster attention mechanism that integrates information at both the cluster and node levels. This approach leverages geometric attention-like mechanisms to capture hierarchical graph structures effectively.\n\n## Copy Gate Integration\n\nCopy gates enable selective computation by allowing the model to skip the transformation of entire layers and pass unchanged input to the next layer.\n\n- The \"Neural Data Router\" proposes using copy gates to facilitate the learning of useful control flow. This mechanism can be integrated into existing transformer architectures to improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary computations[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n## Neural Routing Efficiency\n\nEfficient neural routing involves adaptive serialization of input processing and dynamic routing of information.\n\n- The Cluster-GT framework uses a modular design that allows for efficient graph partitioning and attention mechanisms. It employs a simple graph partition algorithm (Metis) and integrates kernelized attention with multiple kernel learning, which enhances efficiency and captures hierarchical graph structures.\n\n- For general transformer architectures, incorporating geometric attention and copy gates can create efficient information routing paths. This can be achieved by adapting the attention mechanisms to dynamically route information based on the input content, similar to the hybrid approaches mentioned in \"Transformers are SSMs\"[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n## Stability and Training\n\nImproving stability and training efficiency is crucial for integrating these mechanisms.\n\n- Proper normalization and reparameterization, such as spectral normalization and learned scalars, can improve attention stability and prevent attention entropy collapse. This is highlighted in \"Stabilizing Transformer Training\"[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n## Hybrid Architectures and Hardware Efficiency\n\nCombining different attention mechanisms and optimizing for hardware efficiency is essential.\n\n- Hybrid architectures that combine multiple attention mechanisms can leverage their complementary strengths. For example, integrating geometric attention with other attention mechanisms can improve both expressiveness and computational efficiency[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n- For hardware-efficient implementations, libraries like FLA (a Triton-based library for linear attention mechanisms) can be useful. These libraries optimize memory and computation, making the models more practical for real-world applications[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\n## Theoretical Analysis and Implementation\n\n- Theoretical analysis suggests that geometric attention and copy gates can be viewed as part of a broader framework of neural data routing and selective computation. This framework can be generalized to various transformer architectures, including those designed for graph-structured data.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design:\n- **Geometric Attention**: Implement node-to-cluster attention mechanisms or similar geometric attention approaches to focus information flow and capture hierarchical structures efficiently.\n- **Copy Gates**: Integrate copy gates to enable selective computation and reduce unnecessary transformations, improving overall efficiency[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n- **Neural Routing Efficiency**: Use adaptive serialization and dynamic routing mechanisms to optimize information flow based on input content[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n- **Stability and Training**: Employ proper normalization and reparameterization techniques to improve attention stability and prevent entropy collapse[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n- **Hybrid Architectures and Hardware Efficiency**: Combine multiple attention mechanisms and utilize hardware-efficient libraries to optimize memory and computation[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n",

While the time complexity is still $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59 X for inference and by 32 X for differentiation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nAttention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) is widely used in modern neural architectures. In particular, it is the heart of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (Devlin et al., 2019), and found wide-spread adoption across several research areas since then. Given a query $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and lists of keys and values $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ of length $n$, attention is defined as follows:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{e^{s_{i}}}{\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThe result of the attention operation for a single query, is hence a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are the softmax of the dot products of the query and the keys. The straight-forward implementation of the attention operation above requires us to first compute and remember $s_{i}$ for all $i$, leading to a $O(n)$ time and memory complexity for each query. Transformers use self-attention, which issues a separate query for each position in the sequence, so the overall time and space complexity is $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. In many works the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention has been used as the motivation for the investigation of variants of the original attention mechanism and architectures with more favorable complexity classes (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Child et al., 2019; Tay et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020). In this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and logarithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3). We also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory for self-attention (see Section 4 ). Unlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for attention that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient\nalgorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to reconsider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ time complexity for self-attention and $O(n)$ time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention. ## 2 Algorithm\n\nFirst, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with a single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by $\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}$ can be moved to the very end of the attention operation using the distributive law:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=e^{s_{i}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\frac{\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}}{\\sum_{j} s_{j}^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nAfter publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the \"lazy softmax\" method of Jang et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference. To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py). We open-sourced the code of our implementation and most of the evaluation as a colab to help others reproduce the results: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/memory_efficient_attention. ### 5.1 Inference\n\nIn Table 2 we compare the memory requirements and the compute time of the memory-efficient attention implementation and the Flax implementation of attention.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory efficient geometric attention implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Finite strain FFT-based non-linear solvers made simple\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient geometric attention implementation*\n\n*R. H. J. Peerlings, J. Zeman, J. Vondrejc, T. W. J. de Geus, M. G. D. Geers*\n\n**Abstract:** Computational micromechanics and homogenization require the solution of the mechanical equilibrium of a periodic cell that comprises a (generally complex) microstructure. Techniques that apply the Fast Fourier Transform have attracted much attention as they outperform other methods in terms of speed and memory footprint. Moreover, the Fast Fourier Transform is a natural companion of pixel-based digital images which often serve as input. In its original form, one of the biggest challenges for the method is the treatment of (geometrically) non-linear problems, partially due to the need for a uniform linear reference problem. In a geometrically linear setting, the problem has recently been treated in a variational form resulting in an unconditionally stable scheme that combines Newton iterations with an iterative linear solver, and therefore exhibits robust and quadratic convergence behavior. Through this approach, well-known key ingredients were recovered in terms of discretization, numerical quadrature, consistent linearization of the material model, and the iterative solution of the resulting linear system. As a result, the extension to finite strains, using arbitrary constitutive models, is at hand. Because of the application of the Fast Fourier Transform, the implementation is substantially easier than that of other (Finite Element) methods. Both claims are demonstrated in this paper and substantiated with a simple code in Python of just 59 lines (without comments). The aim is to render the method transparent and accessible, whereby researchers that are new to this method should be able to implement it efficiently. The potential of this method is demonstrated using two examples, each with a different material model.\n\n**Published:** 2016-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Filter-Pruning of Lightweight Face Detectors Using a Geometric Median Criterion\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient geometric attention implementation*\n\n*Vasileios Mezaris, Nikolaos Gkalelis, Konstantinos Gkrispanis*\n\n**Abstract:** Face detectors are becoming a crucial component of many applications, including surveillance, that often have to run on edge devices with limited processing power and memory. Therefore, there's a pressing demand for compact face detection models that can function efficiently across resource-constrained devices. Over recent years, network pruning techniques have attracted a lot of attention from researchers. These methods haven't been well examined in the context of face detectors, despite their expanding popularity. In this paper, we implement filter pruning on two already small and compact face detectors, named EXTD (Extremely Tiny Face Detector) and EResFD (Efficient ResNet Face Detector). The main pruning algorithm that we utilize is Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), combined with the Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) iterative procedure. We also apply L1 Norm pruning, as a baseline to compare with the proposed approach. The experimental evaluation on the WIDER FACE dataset indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to further reduce the model size of already lightweight face detectors, with limited accuracy loss, or even with small accuracy gain for low pruning rates.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on memory-efficient geometric attention implementations, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Techniques for Reducing Memory Usage\n\n1. **Flash Attention**: This is a hardware-optimized implementation that significantly reduces both memory usage and runtime compared to the standard attention algorithm. It leverages GPU programming techniques such as kernel fusion and tiling, and it prevents unnecessary memory and compute consumption on padding tokens. This approach is highlighted in the context of protein sequence processing and multimodal molecular representation learning.\n\n2. **Sparse and Low-Rank Attention**: Implementing sparse, linear, or low-rank attention mechanisms can help reduce the complexity and memory usage of attention models. These techniques are particularly useful for large-scale graphs and sequences, as they decrease the computational and memory demands.\n\n3. **bfloat16 Precision**: Using bfloat16 precision can also help in reducing memory overhead. This is demonstrated in the MolMix framework, where bfloat16 precision is used in conjunction with Flash Attention to scale the model efficiently.\n\n## Performance Impact of Memory Optimizations\n\n1. **Runtime Reduction**: The use of Flash Attention can reduce model runtime by approximately 3 to 10 times, depending on the input size. For example, in protein sequence inference, Flash Attention significantly reduces the runtime compared to the original dot-product attention implementation.\n\n2. **Memory Savings**: Flash Attention and other optimized attention mechanisms can lead to substantial memory savings. For instance, in the MolMix framework, Flash Attention reduces memory usage from several tens of gigabytes to just a few gigabytes for similar batch sizes.\n\n## Integration with Existing Attention Architectures\n\n1. **Modular Design**: The MolMix framework integrates Flash Attention seamlessly into a multimodal transformer architecture. This involves combining different modalities (such as SMILES strings, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformers) into a unified sequence processed by a downstream transformer using the optimized attention mechanism.\n\n2. **Graph Transformers**: In the context of graph transformers, efficient attention mechanisms such as linear, sparse, and low-rank attention can be integrated into the message-passing framework to enhance scalability and performance. This involves adapting the attention layer to compute attention scores efficiently while maintaining the expressiveness of the model.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Trade-offs\n\n1. **Balancing Expressiveness and Computation**: There is a need for a careful balance between the expressiveness of the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency. Techniques like sparse attention and low-rank attention can reduce memory usage but may also affect the model's ability to capture complex relationships.\n\n2. **Selective Computation**: Using gating mechanisms or dynamic attention can help in selective computation, reducing unnecessary memory and compute consumption. This is particularly important for large models and datasets.\n\n3. **Domain Adaptation and Meta-Learning**: For robustness and adaptability, techniques such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and meta-learning can be integrated with memory-efficient attention mechanisms to enhance the model's performance across different tasks and domains.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only memory-efficient but also scalable, robust, and highly performant.\n",

[2020] focuses on relative position encoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these approaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the perspective of Neural ODE [hen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the position information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better performance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE. In brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\n- We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly built based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation. - We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention. - We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained language models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer\n\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2). We then describe the rotary position encoding (RoPE) and study its properties in Section (3) We report experiments in Section (4). Finally, we conclude this paper in Section (5)\n\n## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Preliminary\n\nLet $\\mathbb{S}_{N}=\\left\\{w_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be a sequence of $N$ input tokens with $w_{i}$ being the $i^{t h}$ element. The corresponding word embedding of $\\mathbb{S}_{N}$ is denoted as $\\mathbb{E}_{N}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token $w_{i}$ without position information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms them into queries, keys, and value representations. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =f_{q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =f_{k}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{n} & =f_{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}_{n}$ incorporate the $m^{t h}$ and $n^{t h}$ positions through $f_{q}, f_{k}$ and $f_{v}$, respectively. The query and key values are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\nrepresentation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{m, n} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m} & =\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{m, n} \\boldsymbol{v}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form Equation 11 . ### 2.2 Absolute position embedding\n\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\n\n$$\nf_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, i\\right):=\\boldsymbol{W}_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}+\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{p}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/43 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2103.14030, 2021.

Score: 0.54)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n#### 4. CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors is proposed, which enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/29 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2401.01325, 2024.

Cross-view Geo-localization with Layer-to-Layer Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Hongji Yang, Xiufan Lu, Ying J. Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel layer-to-layer Transformer (L2LTR) that utilizes the properties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus signi\ufb01cantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we address the problem of cross-view geo-localization, which estimates the geospatial location of a street view image by matching it with a database of geo-tagged aerial images. The cross-view matching task is extremely challenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views. Unlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a novel layer-to-layer Transformer (L2LTR) that utilizes the properties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus signi\ufb01cantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We also exploit the positional encoding of the Transformer to help the L2LTR understand and correspond geometric con\ufb01g-urations between ground and aerial images. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumptions on geometry knowledge, the L2LTR \ufb02exibly learns the positional embeddings through the training objective. It hence becomes more practical in many real-world scenarios. Although Transformer is well suited to our task, its vanilla self-attention mechanism independently interacts within image patches in each layer, which overlooks correlations between layers. Instead, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-cross attention mechanism to improve the quality of learned representations. Self-cross attention models global dependencies between adjacent layers and creates short paths for effective information \ufb02ow. As a result, the proposed self-cross attention leads to more stable training, improves the generalization ability, and prevents the learned intermediate features from being overly similar. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our L2LTR performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on standard, \ufb01ne-grained, and cross-dataset cross-view geo-localization tasks.

Geometric Transformer with Interatomic Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Yusong Wang, Shaoning Li, Tong Wang, Bin Shao, Nanning Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Geoformer is proposed, a novel geometric Transformer to effectively model molecular structures for various molecular property prediction based on Transformer architecture by designing Interatomic Positional Encoding ( IPE) that parameterizes atomic environments as Transformer\u2019s positional encodings.\n\n**Abstract:** The widespread adoption of Transformer architectures in various data modalities has opened new avenues for the applications in molecular modeling. Neverthe-less, it remains elusive that whether the Transformer-based architecture can do molecular modeling as good as equivariant GNNs. In this paper, by designing Interatomic Positional Encoding ( IPE ) that parameterizes atomic environments as Transformer\u2019s positional encodings, we propose Geoformer , a novel geometric Transformer to effectively model molecular structures for various molecular property prediction. We evaluate Geoformer on several benchmarks, including the QM9 dataset and the recently proposed Molecule3D dataset. Compared with both Trans-formers and equivariant GNN models, Geoformer outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) algorithms on QM9, and achieves the best performance on Molecule3D for both random and scaffold splits. By introducing IPE, Geoformer paves the way for molecular geometric modeling based on Transformer architecture.

Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Shengjie Luo, Shanda Li, Tianle Cai, Di He, Dinglan Peng, Shuxin Zheng, Guolin Ke, Liwei Wang, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and demonstrates that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla Kernelized attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time complexity. Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. What Improves the Generalization of Graph Transformers? A Theoretical Dive into the Self-attention and Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Hongkang Li, Meng Wang, Tengfei Ma, Sijia Liu, Zaixi Zhang, Pin-Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that self-attention and positional encoding enhance generalization by making the attention map sparse and promoting the core neighborhood during training, which explains the superior feature representation of Graph Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Transformers, which incorporate self-attention and positional encoding, have recently emerged as a powerful architecture for various graph learning tasks. Despite their impressive performance, the complex non-convex interactions across layers and the recursive graph structure have made it challenging to establish a theoretical foundation for learning and generalization. This study introduces the first theoretical investigation of a shallow Graph Transformer for semi-supervised node classification, comprising a self-attention layer with relative positional encoding and a two-layer perceptron. Focusing on a graph data model with discriminative nodes that determine node labels and non-discriminative nodes that are class-irrelevant, we characterize the sample complexity required to achieve a desirable generalization error by training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This paper provides the quantitative characterization of the sample complexity and number of iterations for convergence dependent on the fraction of discriminative nodes, the dominant patterns, and the initial model errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-attention and positional encoding enhance generalization by making the attention map sparse and promoting the core neighborhood during training, which explains the superior feature representation of Graph Transformers. Our theoretical results are supported by empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pointer Networks\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Navdeep Jaitly, Oriol Vinyals, Meire Fortunato*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability\nof an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to\npositions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by\nexistent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines,\nbecause the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the\nlength of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized\nsequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this\nclass. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using\na recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous\nattention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of\nan encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a\npointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this\narchitecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn\napproximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar\nconvex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling\nSalesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve\nover sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize\nto variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize\nbeyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these\ntasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete\nproblems.\n\n**Conference:** pointer-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2015-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Andreas Geiger, Max Welling, Bernhard Jaeger, Takeru Miyato*\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Relation-Aware Graph Attention Network for Visual Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: geometric attention positional encoding*\n\n*Yu Cheng, Linjie Li, Jingjing Liu, Zhe Gan*\n\n**Abstract:** In order to answer semantically-complicated questions about an image, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model needs to fully understand the visual scene in the image, especially the interactive dynamics between different objects. We propose a Relation-aware Graph Attention Network (ReGAT), which encodes each image into a graph and models multi-type inter-object relations via a graph attention mechanism, to learn question-adaptive relation representations. Two types of visual object relations are explored: (i) Explicit Relations that represent geometric positions and semantic interactions between objects; and (ii) Implicit Relations that capture the hidden dynamics between image regions. Experiments demonstrate that ReGAT outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on both VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. We further show that ReGAT is compatible to existing VQA architectures, and can be used as a generic relation encoder to boost the model performance for VQA.\n\n**Conference:** relation-aware-graph-attention-network-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating geometric attention and positional encoding, here are some key findings and discussions from the provided sources that align with your requirements:\n\n## Geometric Attention and Positional Encoding\n\n### LieRE Position Encoding\nThe paper on LieRE (Lie group-based Rotary Encoding) introduces a novel position encoding method that leverages the mathematical properties of Lie groups to represent position information. This method is designed to better capture long-range dependencies in sequences, which is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency and Performance Metrics**: LieRE is shown to outperform other position encoding methods like 3D-RPE, POPE, Resonance-ROPE, and ROPE on various language modeling tasks. However, the paper does not delve deeply into the computational complexity, which is an area that needs further investigation.\n\n### Integration of Positional Encodings in INRs\nThe work on implicit neural representations (INRs) for 3D geometry reconstruction also highlights the importance of positional encodings. Here, positional encodings are used to map coordinates into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing the model's ability to capture sharp features and high-frequency components.\n\n- **Attention Patterns with Geometric or Positional Bias**: While this work is focused on 3D geometry, the principle of using positional encodings to capture detailed features can be applied to language models. The integration of normals and periodic activation functions along with positional encodings suggests a way to incorporate geometric priors that could be adapted for attention mechanisms in language models.\n\n## Comparison with Standard Positional Encodings\n\n### LieRE vs. Other Positional Encodings\nThe LieRE method is compared against other popular positional encoding methods and is found to perform better, especially in capturing long-range dependencies. This comparison is crucial for understanding how geometric priors can enhance the performance of attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: LieRE uses a Lie group structure to represent position information, which allows for more effective modeling of long-range dependencies. This is a novel approach that differs from standard rotary positional encodings.\n\n## Geometric Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Tensor Visibility Graph-Enhanced Attention Network (TVGeAN)\nWhile not directly focused on language models, the TVGeAN model introduces a graph attention mechanism that integrates temporal interactions represented in nodes and edges of graphs. This approach could inspire the development of geometric attention mechanisms in language models by incorporating similar graph-based structures to capture complex relationships.\n\n- **Geometric Attention Patterns**: TVGeAN uses a tensor visibility graph to preserve temporal dependencies and mutual relationships between different time series. This concept of using graph structures to enhance attention could be adapted to incorporate geometric priors in language models.\n\n## Areas for Further Investigation\n\n### Computational Efficiency\nThe computational complexity of incorporating geometric attention and novel positional encodings like LieRE needs to be thoroughly analyzed. This includes studying the overhead of these mechanisms and comparing them to existing methods.\n\n### Dynamic Routing and Gating Mechanisms\nThe dynamic head routing mechanism and adaptive copy gates in the proposed GeometricGatedMHA model require further investigation. Comparing these mechanisms to other efficient attention and gating mechanisms, as well as mixture-of-experts approaches, will be essential for optimizing the model's efficiency and scalability.\n\nIn summary, the LieRE position encoding method and the concepts from INRs and TVGeAN provide valuable insights into how geometric priors and novel positional encodings can be integrated into attention mechanisms. These approaches can help in designing more efficient and effective autoregressive language models by better capturing long-range dependencies and complex relationships within sequences. However, detailed analyses of computational complexity, implementation details, and comparisons with existing methods are necessary to fully realize the potential of these novel approaches.\n",

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nTrans.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows selfattention with a sparse routing module based on online $k$-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to $O\\left(n^{1.5} d\\right)$ from $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and hidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs $3.44 \\mathrm{bits} / \\mathrm{dim}$ ) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow. *\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nGenerative models of sequences have witnessed rapid progress driven by the application of attention to neural networks. In particular, Bahdanau et al. (2015); Cho et al. (2014); Vaswani et al. (2017) relied on attention to drastically improve the state-of-the art in machine translation. Subsequent research (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) demonstrated the power of\n\n[^0]self-attention in learning powerful representations of language to address several natural language processing tasks. Self-attention also brought impressive progress for generative modeling outside of language, e.g. image (Parmar et al., 2018; Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2018; Child et al., 2019) and music generation (Huang et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019). Self-attention operates over sequences in a stepwise manner: at every time-step, attention assigns an attention weight to each previous input element (representation of past time-steps) and uses these weights to compute the representation of the current time-step as a weighted sum of the past input elements (Vaswani et al., 2017). Self-attention (Shaw et al., 2018) is a particular case of attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Self-attention is commonly used in autoregressive generative models. These models generate observations step-by-step, modeling the probability of the next symbol given the previously generated ones. At every time step, self-attentive generative models can directly focus on any part of the previous context. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have direct interactions with only a local neighborhood of context around the current time step. This advantage however comes at a price: unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, the time and space complexity of self-attention is quadratic in $n$, the length of the sequence. Specifically, for every position $i \\leq n$, self-attention computes weights for its whole context of length $i$, which induces a complexity of $\\sum_{i \\leq n} i=n(n-1) / 2$. This makes it difficult to scale attention based models to modeling long sequences. However, long sequences are the norm in many domains, including music, image, speech, video generation and document level machine translation. Therefore, an important research direction is to investigate sparse and memory efficient forms of attention in order to scale to tasks with large sequence lengths. Previous work has proposed data independent or fixed sparsity patterns bounding temporal\ndependencies, such as local or strided attention. At each time step, the model attends only to a fixed number of time steps in the past (Child et al., 2019). Extensions to local attention have suggested learning the length of the temporal sparsity for each attention module in the network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These strategies draw their inspiration from RNNs and CNNs and bound their complexity by attending only to representations summarizing a local neighborhood of the current time step. Their attention matrices (matrices containing the attention weights for every pair of previous, current timestep) are natively sparse and require instantiating only non-zero entries. While these approaches have achieved good results, fixing the sparsity pattern of a content based mechanism such as self-attention can limit its ability to pool in information from large contexts. As an alternative to local attention, Correia et al. (2019) consider content-based sparsity, an approach allowing for arbitrary sparsity patterns. This formulation however does require instantiating a full dense attention matrix prior to sparsification through variants of $L_{0}$-sparsity or sparsemax approximations (Blondel et al., 2019). The present work builds upon these two lines of research and proposes to retain the modeling flexibility of content-based sparse attention while leveraging the efficiency of natively sparse attention matrices. Our formulation avoids sparsemax variants and relies on clustering of attention instead. Each attention module considers a clustering of the space: the current time-step only attends to context belonging to the same cluster. In other words, the current time-step query is routed to a limited number of context elements through its cluster assignment. This strategy draws inspiration from the application of spherical $k$-means clustering to the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Our proposed model, Routing Transformer, combines our efficient clustering-based sparse attention with classical local attention to reach excellent performance both for language and image generation.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient attention routing mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Multigrid Neural Memory\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*T. Huynh, M. Maire, Matthew R. Walter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory, which functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results on tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory. Distinct from strategies that connect neural networks to external memory banks via intricately crafted controllers and hand-designed attentional mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed, co-located alongside computation, and implicitly addressed, while being drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting networks with multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories, while multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully connected networks. Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these capabilities on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, and question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Capsule Graph Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Zhang Xinyi, Lihui Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** The high-quality node embeddings learned from the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied to a wide range of node-based applications and some of them have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, when applying node embeddings learned from GNNs to generate graph embeddings, the scalar node representation may not suffice to preserve the node/graph properties efficiently, resulting in sub-optimal graph embeddings.\n\nInspired by the Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet), we propose the Capsule Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN), which adopts the concept of capsules to address the weakness in existing GNN-based graph embeddings algorithms. By extracting node features in the form of capsules, routing mechanism can be utilized to capture important information at the graph level. As a result, our model generates multiple embeddings for each graph to capture graph properties from different aspects. The attention module incorporated in CapsGNN is used to tackle graphs with various sizes which also enables the model to focus on critical parts of the graphs.\n\nOur extensive evaluations with 10 graph-structured datasets demonstrate that CapsGNN has a powerful mechanism that operates to capture macroscopic properties of the whole graph by data-driven. It outperforms other SOTA techniques on several graph classification tasks, by virtue of the new instrument.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2019-5\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Information Flow Routes: Automatically Interpreting Language Models at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Elena Voita, Javier Ferrando*\n\n**Abstract:** Information flows by routes inside the network via mechanisms implemented in the model. These routes can be represented as graphs where nodes correspond to token representations and edges to operations inside the network. We automatically build these graphs in a top-down manner, for each prediction leaving only the most important nodes and edges. In contrast to the existing workflows relying on activation patching, we do this through attribution: this allows us to efficiently uncover existing circuits with just a single forward pass. Additionally, the applicability of our method is far beyond patching: we do not need a human to carefully design prediction templates, and we can extract information flow routes for any prediction (not just the ones among the allowed templates). As a result, we can talk about model behavior in general, for specific types of predictions, or different domains. We experiment with Llama 2 and show that the role of some attention heads is overall important, e.g. previous token heads and subword merging heads. Next, we find similarities in Llama 2 behavior when handling tokens of the same part of speech. Finally, we show that some model components can be specialized on domains such as coding or multilingual texts.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. PreRoutGNN for Timing Prediction with Order Preserving Partition: Global Circuit Pre-training, Local Delay Learning and Attentional Cell Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention routing mechanisms*\n\n*Junchi Yan, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Shixiong Kai, Zhentao Tang, Junjie Ye, RuiZhe Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-routing timing prediction has been recently studied for evaluating the quality of a candidate cell placement in chip design. It involves directly estimating the timing metrics for both pin-level (slack, slew) and edge-level (net delay, cell delay), without time-consuming routing. However, it often suffers from signal decay and error accumulation due to the long timing paths in large-scale industrial circuits. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach. First, we propose global circuit training to pre-train a graph auto-encoder that learns the global graph embedding from circuit netlist. Second, we use a novel node updating scheme for message passing on GCN, following the topological sorting sequence of the learned graph embedding and circuit graph. This scheme residually models the local time delay between two adjacent pins in the updating sequence, and extracts the lookup table information inside each cell via a new attention mechanism. To handle large-scale circuits efficiently, we introduce an order preserving partition scheme that reduces memory consumption while maintaining the topological dependencies. Experiments on 21 real world circuits achieve a new SOTA R2 of 0.93 for slack prediction, which is significantly surpasses 0.59 by previous SOTA method.

This method applies dynamic depth selectively to attention layers, which helps in preserving model accuracy while alleviating the quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms and memory-intensive operations.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\n- The \"MindSkip\" approach optimizes memory usage by skipping attention computations entirely for inputs that do not meet a certain threshold. This dynamic routing mechanism ensures that attention computation only occurs when necessary, significantly reducing memory usage and speeding up inference.\n- The \"CASAK-V\" method employs dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which adapts attention sparsity and KV-cache compression based on the input context and task requirements. This approach maintains efficiency and adaptability across diverse tasks without extensive retraining or architectural modifications.\n\n## Dynamic Routing Strategies\n- \"MindSkip\" incorporates an additional router that determines whether to skip an attention layer based on an importance score. This dynamic depth at the sequence level avoids unbalanced token numbers across sequences and ensures the router is fully trainable through the straight-through estimator (STE).\n- \"CASAK-V\" uses a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that adaptively selects tokens based on criteria such as locality or global importance. This method adjusts the attention pattern based on the input, providing a balance between efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n## Integration with Existing Attention Architectures\n- The \"MindSkip\" approach is integrated with existing language models like Llama, Mistral, and Qwen. By applying dynamic depth to attention layers, it preserves nearly the same performance as the original models while reducing computational and memory costs.\n- \"CASAK-V\" integrates seamlessly with existing pre-trained language models without the need for extensive retraining or architectural modifications. It leverages a lightweight predictor network to estimate token pair importance in the attention matrix, allowing for efficient and adaptive attention mechanisms.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Dynamic Attention Layer Skipping**: The \"MindSkip\" approach is particularly effective in reducing computational and memory costs by dynamically skipping attention layers, making it a promising strategy for improving the efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n- **Dynamic Sparse Attention**: The \"CASAK-V\" method offers a robust and adaptive sparse attention mechanism that can capture necessary contextual information even in long contexts, making it suitable for tasks requiring long-context understanding while maintaining efficiency.\n- **Integration and Scalability**: Both approaches demonstrate the ability to integrate with existing models and architectures, ensuring that the improvements can be scaled up to larger models and diverse tasks without significant performance degradation.\n\nThese strategies and mechanisms can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 2.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths.

Like in regular self-attention, given an input sequence $\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}, \\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}^{(N)}\\right]$ with $\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {in }}}$, each input is projected to key $\\boldsymbol{k}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }}}$, value $\\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {value }}}$, query $\\boldsymbol{q}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }}}$ vectors, and the dot product is computed for each key/query combination. In our geometric attention, the dot product is followed by a sigmoid function to obtain a score between 0 and 1:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{P}_{i, j}=\\sigma\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}^{(j) \\top} \\boldsymbol{q}^{(i)}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich will be treated as a probability of the key at (source) position $j$ matching the query at (target) position $i$. These probabilities are finally converted to the attention scores $\\boldsymbol{A}_{i, j}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{i, j}=\\boldsymbol{P}_{i, j} \\prod_{k \\in \\mathbb{S}_{i, j}}\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{P}_{i, k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{S}_{i, j}$ denotes the set of all (source) indices which are closer to $i$ than $j$ is to $i$, and when two indices have the same distance to $i$, we consider the one which is to the right of $i$ (i.e., greater than $i$ ) to be closer, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{S}_{i, j}= \\begin{cases}k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}:|i-k|<|i-j|, & \\text { if } i<j \\\\ k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}:|i-k| \\leq|i-j|, & \\text { if } j<i\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIn addition, we explicitly zero out the diagonal by setting $\\boldsymbol{A}_{i, i}=0$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, N$. The ordering of source indices is illustrated in Figure 1 /Right. The resulting scores $\\boldsymbol{A}_{i, j}$ are the attention scores used to compute the weighted averages of the value vectors. By using the terms $\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{P}_{i, k}\\right)$ in Eq. 7 , when there is a match, it downscales any other more distant matches. Two recent works (Brooks et al., 2021, Banino et al., 2021) use such a parameterized geometric distribution in the form of Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparse and continuous attention mechanisms (Avg.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/36 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\n[22] M.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Improved Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Energy-Based Priors: a Study on Electrical Impedance Tomography\n\n*From Search Query: geometric priors neural networks attention*\n\n*Akarsh Pokkunuru, Pedram Rooshenas, Thilo Strauss, Anuj Abhishek, T. Khan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Bayesian approach through data-driven energy-based model (EBM) as a prior is proposed, to improve the overall accuracy and quality of tomographic reconstruction of physics-based neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are attracting significant attention for solving partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problems, including electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is non-linear and especially its inverse problem is highly ill-posed. Therefore, successful training of PINN is extremely sensitive to interplay between different loss terms and hyper-parameters, including the learning rate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian approach through data-driven energy-based model (EBM) as a prior, to improve the overall accuracy and quality of tomographic reconstruction. In particular, the EBM is trained over the possible solutions of the PDEs with different boundary conditions. By imparting such prior onto physics-based training, PINN convergence is expedited by more than ten times faster to the PDE\u2019s solution. Evaluation outcome shows that our proposed method is more robust for solving the EIT problem.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: geometric priors neural networks attention*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Learning Neural Implicit through Volume Rendering with Attentive Depth Fusion Priors\n\n*From Search Query: geometric priors neural networks attention*\n\n*Pengchong Hu, Zhizhong Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn neural implicit representations from multi-view RGBD images through volume rendering with an attentive depth fusion prior that allows neural networks to perceive coarse 3D structures from the Truncated Signed Distance Function fused from all depth images available for rendering.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning neural implicit representations has achieved remarkable performance in 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Current methods use volume rendering to render implicit representations into either RGB or depth images that are supervised by multi-view ground truth. However, rendering a view each time suffers from incomplete depth at holes and unawareness of occluded structures from the depth supervision, which severely affects the accuracy of geometry inference via volume rendering. To resolve this issue, we propose to learn neural implicit representations from multi-view RGBD images through volume rendering with an attentive depth fusion prior. Our prior allows neural networks to perceive coarse 3D structures from the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) fused from all depth images available for rendering. The TSDF enables accessing the missing depth at holes on one depth image and the occluded parts that are invisible from the current view. By introducing a novel attention mechanism, we allow neural networks to directly use the depth fusion prior with the inferred occupancy as the learned implicit function. Our attention mechanism works with either a one-time fused TSDF that represents a whole scene or an incrementally fused TSDF that represents a partial scene in the context of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Our evaluations on widely used benchmarks including synthetic and real-world scans show our superiority over the latest neural implicit methods.

State-of-the-art methods cast this problem as an optimization task, where the input source mesh is iteratively deformed to minimize an objective function according to hand-crafted regularizers such as ARAP. In this work, we learn the deformation behavior based on the underlying geometric properties of a shape, while leveraging a large-scale dataset containing a diverse set of non-rigid deformations. Specifically, given a source mesh and desired target locations of handles that describe the partial surface deformation, we predict a continuous deformation field that is defined in 3D space to describe the space deformation. To this end, we introduce transformer-based deformation networks that represent a shape deformation as a composition of local surface deformations. It learns a set of local latent codes anchored in 3D space, from which we can learn a set of continuous deformation functions for local surfaces. Our method can be applied to challenging deformations and generalizes well to unseen deformations. We validate our approach in experiments using the DeformingThing4D dataset, and compare to both classic optimization-based and recent neural network-based methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Assignments are estimated by solving a differentiable optimal transport problem, whose costs are predicted by a graph neural network. We introduce a flexible context aggregation mechanism based on attention, enabling SuperGlue to reason about the underlying 3D scene and feature assignments jointly. Compared to traditional, hand-designed heuristics, our technique learns priors over geometric transformations and regularities of the 3D world through end-to-end training from image pairs. SuperGlue outperforms other learned approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the task of pose estimation in challenging real-world indoor and outdoor environments.

Geometric deep learning reveals the spatiotemporal fingerprint of microscopic motion\n\n*From Search Query: geometric priors neural networks attention*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The characterization of dynamical processes in living systems provides important clues for their mechanistic interpretation and link to biological functions. Thanks to recent advances in microscopy techniques, it is now possible to routinely record the motion of cells, organelles, and individual molecules at multiple spatiotemporal scales in physiological conditions. However, the automated analysis of dynamics occurring in crowded and complex environments still lags behind the acquisition of microscopic image sequences. Here, we present a framework based on geometric deep learning that achieves the accurate estimation of dynamical properties in various biologically-relevant scenarios. This deep-learning approach relies on a graph neural network enhanced by attention-based components. By processing object features with geometric priors, the network is capable of performing multiple tasks, from linking coordinates into trajectories to inferring local and global dynamic properties. We demonstrate the flexibility and reliability of this approach by applying it to real and simulated data corresponding to a broad range of biological experiments.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding the Role of Training Regimes in Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: geometric priors neural networks attention*\n\n*Mehrdad Farajtabar, Seyed Iman Mirzadeh, Razvan Pascanu, Hassan Ghasemzadeh*\n\n**Abstract:** Catastrophic forgetting affects the training of neural networks, limiting their ability to learn multiple tasks sequentially. From the perspective of the well established plasticity-stability dilemma, neural networks tend to be overly plastic, lacking the stability necessary to prevent the forgetting of previous knowledge, which means that as learning progresses, networks tend to forget previously seen tasks. This phenomenon coined in the continual learning literature, has attracted much attention lately, and several families of approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. However, there has been limited prior work extensively analyzing the impact that different training regimes -- learning rate, batch size, regularization method-- can have on forgetting. In this work, we depart from the typical approach of altering the learning algorithm to improve stability. Instead, we hypothesize that the geometrical properties of the local minima found for each task play an important role in the overall degree of forgetting. In particular, we study the effect of dropout, learning rate decay, and batch size, on forming training regimes that widen the tasks' local minima and consequently, on helping it not to forget catastrophically. Our study provides practical insights to improve stability via simple yet effective techniques that outperform alternative baselines.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by incorporating geometric priors, attention mechanisms, and ensuring efficiency, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Implementation Details of Geometric Priors\n\nGeometric Deep Learning (GDL) is a field that extends traditional deep learning to handle non-Euclidean data, such as graphs, manifolds, and point clouds, by leveraging geometric principles like symmetries and invariances.\n\n- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs are a key component of GDL, and they can be designed to incorporate geometric priors. For example, separating self-interaction and neighbor-interaction terms in GNNs can improve accuracy and adhere to spatio-temporal locality, as seen in the Graph Neural Vector Field (GNVF) model.\n- **Symmetry and Invariance:** Geometric priors can be implemented using group theory, which studies symmetries. This allows neural networks to exploit symmetries in the data, such as translation equivariance in CNNs or more complex gauge symmetries in gauge equivariant networks.\n\n## Impact on Model Performance\n\n- **Improved Accuracy:** Incorporating geometric priors can significantly improve the performance of models. For instance, the GNVF model outperforms other state-of-the-art deep graph neural networks by separating self- and neighbor-interaction terms, which aligns with the geometric properties of the data.\n- **Efficiency and Generalization:** Geometric priors can help models achieve better performance with less data, making them more efficient and generalizable. This is particularly useful in domains where data is scarce or complex, such as drug discovery or social network analysis.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Attention Mechanisms in GDL:** While the primary focus of GDL has been on handling non-Euclidean data, integrating attention mechanisms can further enhance model performance. For example, attention can be used to selectively focus on relevant parts of the data, similar to how feature-based attention modulates neural responses in visual processing models.\n- **Geometric Attention Patterns:** Incorporating geometric priors into attention mechanisms can lead to more efficient and effective attention patterns. For instance, using positional priors and adaptive mechanisms can help in balancing local and global attention, as proposed in the GeometricGatedMHA model[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory and Computational Efficiency Considerations\n\n- **Dynamic Routing and Sparse Attention:** To optimize memory and computational efficiency, dynamic routing and sparse attention patterns can be employed. These approaches reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms, such as from \\(O(n^2 d)\\) to \\(O(n^{1.5} d)\\)[Analysis Note: \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention\"].\n- **Memory Optimization:** Techniques like selective computation and adaptive copy gates can help in optimizing memory usage. These methods ensure that computation and memory are allocated only to relevant parts of the data, thus reducing overall complexity[Analysis Note: \"AtMan\"].\n- **Efficient Architectures:** Architectures that integrate geometric priors with attention mechanisms need to be designed with careful consideration of computational overhead and memory efficiency. This includes using hierarchical coordinate frames and group theory to ensure that the models respect the underlying geometric structure of the data while being computationally efficient.\n\nIn summary, incorporating geometric priors into neural networks, particularly in the context of attention mechanisms, can significantly enhance model performance, efficiency, and generalization. This involves careful implementation of symmetry and invariance principles, integration with attention mechanisms, and optimization of memory and computational resources.\n",

Motivation\n\nCurrent Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanisms face several challenges:\n- Quadratic computational complexity with sequence length\n- Uniform attention computation regardless of input complexity\n- Limited ability to capture hierarchical relationships\n- Inefficient handling of information routing\n\nThese limitations affect both model performance and computational efficiency. A more intelligent attention mechanism that can selectively process information and capture geometric relationships could significantly improve both aspects.\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis\n\nThe key issues with standard MHA include:\n\n1. **Computational Inefficiency**:\n   - All attention heads process all tokens uniformly\n   - No mechanism to skip unnecessary computations\n   - Fixed computation patterns regardless of input complexity\n\n2. **Limited Expressiveness**:\n   - Lack of explicit geometric relationships between tokens\n   - No hierarchical structure in attention patterns\n   - Uniform treatment of local and global contexts\n\n3. **Information Routing**:\n   - Inefficient routing of information between tokens\n   - No explicit mechanism for selective computation\n   - Limited ability to adapt to input characteristics\n\n### 3. Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nGeometricGatedMHA introduces three key innovations:\n\n1. **Geometric Attention Patterns**:\n   - Incorporate geometric priors in attention computation\n   - Enable hierarchical attention routing\n   - Capture both local and global relationships\n\n2. **Adaptive Copy Gates**:\n   - Allow selective computation based on input complexity\n   - Enable efficient information routing\n   - Reduce unnecessary computations\n\n3. **Dynamic Head Routing**:\n   - Route information through relevant attention heads\n   - Adapt attention patterns to input characteristics\n   - Enable specialized processing for different types of relationships\n\n### 4. Design Plan\n\n#### 4.1 Architecture Overview\n\nThe GeometricGatedMHA consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Geometric Attention Module**:\n```python\nclass GeometricAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.scale = dim ** -0.5\n        self.geometric_proj = nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n        self.distance_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_heads, 1, 1))\n        \n    def forward(self, q, k, v, pos_encoding):\n        # Compute geometric relationships\n        geo_bias = self.compute_geometric_bias(q, k, pos_encoding)\n        # Apply attention with geometric bias\n        attn = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * self.scale + geo_bias\n        return attn @ v\n```\n\n2. **Copy Gate Mechanism**:\n```python\nclass CopyGate(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(dim, 1)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, transformed):\n        # Compute gate values\n        gate = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_proj(x))\n        # Selectively copy or transform\n        return gate * transformed + (1 - gate) * x\n```\n\n3. **Head Router**:\n```python\nclass HeadRouter(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.router = nn.Linear(dim, num_heads)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Compute routing weights\n        weights = torch.softmax(self.router(x), dim=-1)\n        return weights\n```\n\n#### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Geometric Attention**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{GeoAttn}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + G(Q, K))V\n   \\]\n   where G(Q, K) is the geometric bias computed from positional relationships.\n\n2. **Copy Gate**:\n   \\[\n   g = \\sigma(W_g x + b_g)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = g \\odot \\text{Transform}(x) + (1-g) \\odot x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Head Routing**:\n   \\[\n   r = \\text{softmax}(W_r x + b_r)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\sum_{i=1}^h r_i \\text{Head}_i(x)\n   \\]\n\n### 5. Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n```python\nclass GeometricGatedMHA(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_heads = config.num_heads\n        self.head_dim = config.hidden_size // config.num_heads\n        self.geo_attn = GeometricAttention(config.hidden_size, config.num_heads)\n        self.copy_gate = CopyGate(config.hidden_size)\n        self.head_router = HeadRouter(config.hidden_size, config.num_heads)\n```\n\n2. **Forward Pass**:\n```python\ndef forward(self, x, pos_encoding):\n    # Compute routing weights\n    route_weights = self.head_router(x)\n    \n    # Split into heads\n    q, k, v = self.project_qkv(x)\n    \n    # Apply geometric attention\n    attn_output = self.geo_attn(q, k, v, pos_encoding)\n    \n    # Apply copy gate\n    gated_output = self.copy_gate(x, attn_output)\n    \n    return gated_output\n```\n\n3. **Integration with Existing Model**:\n- Replace standard MHA layers with GeometricGatedMHA\n- Maintain compatibility with existing model components\n- Ensure proper gradient flow through all components\n\n### 6. Theoretical Analysis\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**:\n- Base attention: O(n\u00b2d) where n is sequence length and d is dimension\n- Geometric bias: O(n\u00b2) additional computation\n- Copy gate: O(nd) additional computation\n- Overall complexity remains O(n\u00b2d) but with reduced constant factors\n\n2. **Memory Usage**:\n- Additional parameters for geometric projections: O(d\u00b2)\n- Copy gate parameters: O(d)\n- Head router parameters: O(dh) where h is number of heads\n- Total additional parameters: O(d\u00b2)\n\n3. **Expected Benefits**:\n- Reduced computation through selective processing\n- Better capture of hierarchical relationships\n- Improved information routing\n- Enhanced model expressiveness\n\n### 7.
