Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 4.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

An Empirical Study on Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero-Shot Labels\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Ilias Chalkidis, Manos Fergadiotis, Sotiris Kotitsas, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Nikolaos Aletras, Ion Androutsopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains, and shows that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWans.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges. First, not all labels are well represented in the training set, due to the very large label set and the skewed label distributions of LMTC datasets. Also, label hierarchies and differences in human labelling guidelines may affect graph-aware annotation proximity. Finally, the label hierarchies are periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning, although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art method which combines BERT with LWANs. Finally, we propose new models that leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 76  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

O. Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Pit One Against Many: Leveraging Attention-head Embeddings for Parameter-efficient Multi-head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Huiyin Xue, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head, and empirically demonstrates that this MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling pre-trained language models has resulted in large performance gains in various natural language processing tasks but comes with a large cost in memory requirements. Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 9. AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Lingkai Kong, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, is proposed, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback, and develops a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the potential in acting as autonomous agents for sequential decision-making tasks. However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-scale Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Cascaded Attention Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Radu Marculescu, Md Mostafijur Rahman*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great success in medical image segmentation. However, transformers may exhibit a limited generalization ability due to the underlying single-scale self-attention (SA) mechanism. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a Multi-scale hiERarchical vIsion Transformer (MERIT) backbone network, which improves the generalizability of the model by computing SA at multiple scales. We also incorporate an attention-based decoder, namely Cascaded Attention Decoding (CASCADE), for further refinement of multi-stage features generated by MERIT. Finally, we introduce an effective multi-stage feature mixing loss aggregation (MUTATION) method for better model training via implicit ensembling. Our experiments on two widely used medical image segmentation benchmarks (i.e., Synapse Multi-organ, ACDC) demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT over state-of-the-art methods. Our MERIT architecture and MUTATION loss aggregation can be used with downstream medical image and semantic segmentation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** multi-scale-hierarchical-vision-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Image and Video Tokenization with Binary Spherical Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Yuanjun Xiong, Yue Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new transformer-based image and video tokenizer with Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ). BSQ projects the high-dimensional visual embedding to a lower-dimensional hypersphere and then applies binary quantization. BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. ERNIE-Tiny : A Progressive Distillation Framework for Pretrained Transformer Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, Hua Wu, Hao Tian, Yu Sun, Weixin Liu, Jiaxiang Liu, Shikun Feng, Xuyi Chen, Weiyue Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT adopt a training paradigm which first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on task-specific data, and have recently achieved great success. However, PLMs are notorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life applications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this problem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller student over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key components, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial to the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage progressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the three components gradually from general level to task-specific level. Specifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with guidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss. Then, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained teacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts training data from general data to task-specific data. In the end, Task-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and Hard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In particular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over 98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of parameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five Chinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer parameters and9.4x faster inference speed.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive state compression, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of hierarchical attention is well-demonstrated in models like the **Hierarchical Attention-gated Swin Transformers**.

This can serve as a model for integrating hierarchical attention and feature fusion within GAUs.\n- **Dual Cross-Attention**: MHCFIN also employs dual cross-attention at the decoder to achieve complementary knowledge transfer across modalities. This concept can be adapted to facilitate information exchange between different hierarchical levels in GAUs.\n- **Residual Connections and Convolution Operations**: The use of residual connections and convolution operations in hierarchical attention models can help reduce information loss and enhance feature extraction, which is relevant for optimizing GAUs.\n\n### Key Insights for Implementation\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Implementing hierarchical processing within GAUs can capture both local and global dependencies efficiently, reducing computational overhead.\n- **Linear Attention**: Integrating linear attention mechanisms can make the model more memory-efficient without compromising performance.\n- **Adaptive Compression**: Dynamic state compression can optimize memory usage by retaining critical information and discarding less relevant data.\n- **Dual-Stream Processing**: Separating fast and slow state updates, as seen in Temporal Latent Bottleneck, can be beneficial for managing memory and capturing hierarchical relationships in sequence data.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **Advanced Hierarchical Attention Models**:\n   - Investigate recent hierarchical transformer models like MATNet and Hierarchical Attention-gated Swin Transformers to identify best practices for hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n   \n2. **State Compression Techniques**:\n   - Delve deeper into adaptive state compression methods to understand how they can be dynamically adjusted based on input complexity and integrated into GAUs.\n   \n3. **Dual-Stream Processing Architectures**:\n   - Study dual-stream processing frameworks to understand how separating fast and slow state updates can be applied within GAUs.\n   \n4. **Hardware-Efficient Training Methods**:\n   - Explore hardware-aware optimizations and gradient checkpointing strategies to enhance training and inference efficiency in hierarchical GAUs.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive state compression, potentially outperforming current state-of-the-art models in terms of memory efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/41 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\n# When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models \n\nHaoran You ${ }^{1}$ Yichao Fu ${ }^{1}$ Zheng Wang ${ }^{1}$ Amir Yazdanbakhsh ${ }^{2}$ Yingyan (Celine) Lin ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAutoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers, efficient state compression techniques, scalable autoregressive models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

An Empirical Study on Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero-Shot Labels\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Ilias Chalkidis, Manos Fergadiotis, Sotiris Kotitsas, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Nikolaos Aletras, Ion Androutsopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains, and shows that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWans.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges. First, not all labels are well represented in the training set, due to the very large label set and the skewed label distributions of LMTC datasets. Also, label hierarchies and differences in human labelling guidelines may affect graph-aware annotation proximity. Finally, the label hierarchies are periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning, although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art method which combines BERT with LWANs. Finally, we propose new models that leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 76  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5.

Jaiswal, Kaidi Xu, B. Kailkhura, Dan Hendrycks, Dawn Song, Zhangyang Wang, Bo Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of three leading LLMs using five SoTA compression techniques across eight trustworthiness dimensions, finding that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing high-capability Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a favored strategy for resource-efficient inferences. While state-of-the-art (SoTA) compression methods boast impressive advancements in preserving benign task performance, the potential risks of compression in terms of safety and trustworthiness have been largely neglected. This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of three (3) leading LLMs using five (5) SoTA compression techniques across eight (8) trustworthiness dimensions. Our experiments highlight the intricate interplay between compression and trustworthiness, revealing some interesting patterns. We find that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. For instance, a 4-bit quantized model retains the trustworthiness of its original counterpart, but model pruning significantly degrades trustworthiness, even at 50% sparsity. Moreover, employing quantization within a moderate bit range could unexpectedly improve certain trustworthiness dimensions such as ethics and fairness. Conversely, extreme quantization to very low bit levels (3 bits) tends to reduce trustworthiness significantly. This increased risk cannot be uncovered by looking at benign performance alone, in turn, mandating comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation in practice. These findings culminate in practical recommendations for simultaneously achieving high utility, efficiency, and trustworthiness in LLMs. Code and models are available at https://decoding-comp-trust.github.io.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers for Flexible Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that after a single training phase, Modular Transformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with little to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained Transformer models like T5 and BART have advanced the state of the art on a wide range of text generation tasks. Compressing these models into smaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural network compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization are limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this paper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder framework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular Transformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or more consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and knowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly assembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different performance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a single training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular Transformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with little to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT in both fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings. Our findings highlight the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models.

A promising approach is to extract preferences for behaviors from unlabeled videos, which are widely available on the internet. We present Video Prediction Rewards (VIPER), an algorithm that leverages pretrained video prediction models as action-free reward signals for reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first train an autoregressive transformer on expert videos and then use the video prediction likelihoods as reward signals for a reinforcement learning agent. VIPER enables expert-level control without programmatic task rewards across a wide range of DMC, Atari, and RLBench tasks. Moreover, generalization of the video prediction model allows us to derive rewards for an out-of-distribution environment where no expert data is available, enabling cross-embodiment generalization for tabletop manipulation. We see our work as starting point for scalable reward specification from unlabeled videos that will benefit from the rapid advances in generative modeling.

Multi-scale Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Cascaded Attention Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale attention transformers*\n\n*Radu Marculescu, Md Mostafijur Rahman*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great success in medical image segmentation. However, transformers may exhibit a limited generalization ability due to the underlying single-scale self-attention (SA) mechanism. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a Multi-scale hiERarchical vIsion Transformer (MERIT) backbone network, which improves the generalizability of the model by computing SA at multiple scales. We also incorporate an attention-based decoder, namely Cascaded Attention Decoding (CASCADE), for further refinement of multi-stage features generated by MERIT. Finally, we introduce an effective multi-stage feature mixing loss aggregation (MUTATION) method for better model training via implicit ensembling. Our experiments on two widely used medical image segmentation benchmarks (i.e., Synapse Multi-organ, ACDC) demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT over state-of-the-art methods. Our MERIT architecture and MUTATION loss aggregation can be used with downstream medical image and semantic segmentation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** multi-scale-hierarchical-vision-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 2.

From a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck, especially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer limited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique to reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is error-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under 1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only work with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly dependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based optimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and accuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that reduces the communication volume by up to $5\\times$, offers much better scalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our key finding is that Adam's variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a warmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the training (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit Adam enables up to $3.3\\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training and up to $2.9\\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis for our proposed work.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models with a Single GPU\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques*\n\n*Ce Zhang, Ion Stoica, Christopher R\u00e9, Percy Liang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

Scalable Pre-training of Large Autoregressive Image Models\n\n*From Search Query: scalable autoregressive models*\n\n*Armand Joulin, Joshua M Susskind, Vaishaal Shankar, Alexander Toshev, Miguel Angel Bautista, Shuangfei Zhai, Michal Klein, Alaaeldin El-Nouby*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces AIM, a collection of vision models pre-trained with an autoregressive objective. These models are inspired by their textual counterparts, i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs), and exhibit similar scaling properties. Specifically, we highlight two key findings: (1) the performance of the visual features scale with both the model capacity and the quantity of data, (2) the value of the objective function correlates with the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We illustrate the practical implication of these findings by pre-training a 7 billion parameter AIM on 2 billion images, that achieves 84.0% on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Interestingly, even at this scale, we observe no sign of saturation in performance, suggesting that AIM potentially represents a new frontier for training large-scale vision models. The pre-training of AIM is similar to the pre-training of LLMs, and does not require any image-specific strategy to stabilize the training at scale.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16\n\n\n\n#### 6. Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: scalable autoregressive models*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Bingyue Peng, Zehuan Yuan, Yi Jiang, Keyu Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine \"next-scale prediction\" or \"next-resolution prediction\", diverging from the standard raster-scan \"next-token prediction\". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-like AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating **hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms** and **efficient state compression techniques**, here are the most relevant and useful insights and references:\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **MATNet**: This model introduces a multilevel attention network capable of extracting multilevel features of global and local contexts, which is highly relevant for capturing varying granularities of information in autoregressive models.\n- **Hierarchical Neural Story Generation**: This work uses hierarchical attention mechanisms to generate coherent and fluent passages, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-level attention in understanding complex dependencies.\n- **A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer**: This model employs a quad-tree hierarchy for multi-resolution representation learning, which can be adapted to manage varying levels of detail in sequence data.\n\n### Efficient State Compression Techniques\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression in Neural Networks**: This technique involves dynamically adjusting compression rates based on input complexity, ensuring that essential information is preserved while optimizing memory usage.\n- **SelectiveGatedMHA**: This approach integrates hierarchical attention with dynamic parameter sharing, achieving substantial memory efficiency while retaining high predictive performance.\n- **Memory Efficient Neural Processes via Constant Memory Attention Block**: This method uses constant memory attention blocks, enabling more memory-efficient attention mechanisms within autoregressive models.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Linformer**: This model reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear using low-rank matrix projections, which can significantly enhance scalability and memory efficiency.\n- **Neighborhood Attention Transformer**: This approach localizes self-attention to the nearest neighboring tokens or pixels, achieving linear time and space complexity while preserving translational equivariance.\n\n### Dual-Stream Processing and State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Temporal Latent Bottleneck**: This architecture separates fast and slow state updates, facilitating efficient memory management and better capture of hierarchical relationships in sequence data.\n- **Mamba and DenseMamba**: These models integrate State Space Models (SSMs) to handle long sequences efficiently, maintaining compressed state representations that complement hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Gradient Checkpointing**: To manage memory during training, especially with hierarchical and multi-scale mechanisms, employing gradient checkpointing can help reduce the memory footprint without sacrificing performance.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Leveraging hardware-efficient operations, as seen in the **Neighborhood Attention Transformer** and **Mamba**, ensures that the enhanced GAU can perform optimally on standard hardware without additional computational costs.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **MATNet**: Multilevel attention-based transformers for change detection, which can be adapted for hierarchical attention in GAUs.\n2. **Linformer**: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity, providing a method to reduce computational and memory overhead.\n3. **A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer**: Demonstrates the use of a quad-tree hierarchy for multi-resolution representation learning, applicable to sequence data.\n4. **Adaptive State Compression in Neural Networks**: Dynamic state compression techniques to optimize memory usage based on input complexity.\n5. **SelectiveGatedMHA**: Hierarchical attention with dynamic parameter sharing for memory-efficient and high-performance attention mechanisms.\n6. **Temporal Latent Bottleneck**: Dual-stream processing architecture for efficient handling of short-term and long-term dependencies.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researcher can develop an enhanced FastTTTLinear GAU that is more efficient, scalable, and capable of capturing complex dependencies in sequence data.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail.

MobileSpeech: A Fast and High-Fidelity Framework for Mobile Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms for autoregressive models*\n\n*Shengpeng Ji, Ziyue Jiang, Hanting Wang, Jia-li Zuo, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes MobileSpeech, which is a fast, lightweight, and robust zero-shot text-to-speech system based on mobile devices for the first time, and introduces a high-level probabilistic mask that simulates the progression of information flow from less to more during speech generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has gained significant attention due to its powerful voice cloning capabilities, requiring only a few seconds of unseen speaker voice prompts. However, all previous work has been developed for cloud-based systems. Taking autoregressive models as an example, although these approaches achieve high-fidelity voice cloning, they fall short in terms of inference speed, model size, and robustness. Therefore, we propose MobileSpeech, which is a fast, lightweight, and robust zero-shot text-to-speech system based on mobile devices for the first time. Specifically: 1) leveraging discrete codec, we design a parallel speech mask decoder module called SMD, which incorporates hierarchical information from the speech codec and weight mechanisms across different codec layers during the generation process. Moreover, to bridge the gap between text and speech, we introduce a high-level probabilistic mask that simulates the progression of information flow from less to more during speech generation. 2) For speaker prompts, we extract fine-grained prompt duration from the prompt speech and incorporate text, prompt speech by cross attention in SMD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileSpeech on multilingual datasets at different levels, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of generating speed and speech quality. MobileSpeech achieves RTF of 0.09 on a single A100 GPU and we have successfully deployed MobileSpeech on mobile devices.

They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options.

Comparing Rewinding and Fine-tuning in Neural Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: neural network state compression techniques*\n\n*Alex Renda, Jonathan Frankle, Michael Carbin*\n\n**TL;DR:** Fine-tuning is compared to alternative retraining techniques, and learning rate rewinding is proposed, forming the basis of a network-agnostic pruning algorithm that matches the accuracy and compression ratios of several more network-specific state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Many neural network pruning algorithms proceed in three steps: train the network to completion, remove unwanted structure to compress the network, and retrain the remaining structure to recover lost accuracy. The standard retraining technique, fine-tuning, trains the unpruned weights from their final trained values using a small fixed learning rate. In this paper, we compare fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training schedule. Learning rate rewinding (which we propose) trains the unpruned weights from their final values using the same learning rate schedule as weight rewinding. Both rewinding techniques outperform fine-tuning, forming the basis of a network-agnostic pruning algorithm that matches the accuracy and compression ratios of several more network-specific state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 357  (*Influential: 52*)\n\n#### 5.

Brooks*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel scheme for lossy weight encoding co-designed with weight simplification techniques that can compress weights by up to 496x without loss of model accuracy, resulting in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Abstract:** The large memory requirements of deep neural networks limit their deployment and adoption on many devices. Model compression methods effectively reduce the memory requirements of these models, usually through applying transformations such as weight pruning or quantization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for lossy weight encoding co-designed with weight simplification techniques. The encoding is based on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed technique, named Weightless, can compress weights by up to 496x without loss of model accuracy. This results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Compression-aware Training of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network state compression techniques*\n\n*J. \u00c1lvarez, M. Salzmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that accounting for compression during training allows us to learn much more compact, yet at least as effective, models than state-of-the-art compression techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, great progress has been made in a variety of application domains thanks to the development of increasingly deeper neural networks. Unfortunately, the huge number of units of these networks makes them expensive both computationally and memory-wise. To overcome this, exploiting the fact that deep networks are over-parametrized, several compression strategies have been proposed. These methods, however, typically start from a network that has been trained in a standard manner, without considering such a future compression. In this paper, we propose to explicitly account for compression in the training process. To this end, we introduce a regularizer that encourages the parameter matrix of each layer to have low rank during training. We show that accounting for compression during training allows us to learn much more compact, yet at least as effective, models than state-of-the-art compression techniques.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 7. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architectures*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

In this paper, we propose a general multi-scale framework that can be applied to the state-of-the-art transformer-based time series forecasting models (FEDformer, Autoformer, etc.). By iteratively refining a forecasted time series at multiple scales with shared weights, introducing architecture adaptations, and a specially-designed normalization scheme, we are able to achieve significant performance improvements, from 5.5% to 38.5% across datasets and transformer architectures, with minimal additional computational overhead. Via detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of each of our contributions across the architecture and methodology. Furthermore, our experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that the proposed improvements outperform their corresponding baseline counterparts.

Vision Transformer Adapter for Dense Predictions\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architectures*\n\n*Zhe Chen, Yuchen Duan, Wenhai Wang, Junjun He, Tong Lu, Jifeng Dai, Y. Qiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The ViT-Adapter is proposed, which allows plain ViT to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers and facilitate future research and is verified on multiple dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.\n\n**Abstract:** This work investigates a simple yet powerful dense prediction task adapter for Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike recently advanced variants that incorporate vision-specific inductive biases into their architectures, the plain ViT suffers inferior performance on dense predictions due to weak prior assumptions. To address this issue, we propose the ViT-Adapter, which allows plain ViT to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers. Specifically, the backbone in our framework is a plain ViT that can learn powerful representations from large-scale multi-modal data. When transferring to downstream tasks, a pre-training-free adapter is used to introduce the image-related inductive biases into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify ViT-Adapter on multiple dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, without using extra detection data, our ViT-Adapter-L yields state-of-the-art 60.9 box AP and 53.0 mask AP on COCO test-dev. We hope that the ViT-Adapter could serve as an alternative for vision-specific transformers and facilitate future research.

Bidirectional Variational Inference for Non-Autoregressive Text-to-Speech\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms for autoregressive models*\n\n*Kyomin Jung, Joongbo Shin, Yoonhyung Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Although early text-to-speech (TTS) models such as Tacotron 2 have succeeded in generating human-like speech, their autoregressive (AR) architectures have a limitation that they require a lot of time to generate a mel-spectrogram consisting of hundreds of steps. In this paper, we propose a novel non-autoregressive TTS model called BVAE-TTS, which eliminates the architectural limitation and generates a mel-spectrogram in parallel. BVAE-TTS adopts bidirectional-inference variational autoencoder (BVAE) that learns hierarchical latent representations using both bottom-up and top-down paths to increase its expressiveness. To apply BVAE to TTS, we design our model to utilize text information via an attention mechanism. By using attention maps that BVAE-TTS generates, we train a duration predictor so that the model uses the predicted length of each phoneme at inference. In experiments conducted on LJSpeech dataset, we show that our model generates a mel-spectrogram 27 times faster than Tacotron 2 with similar speech quality. Furthermore, our BVAE-TTS outperforms Glow-TTS, which is one of the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS models, in terms of both speech quality and inference speed while having 58% fewer parameters.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. PPAD: Iterative Interactions of Prediction and Planning for End-to-end Autonomous Driving\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms for autoregressive models*\n\n*Qifeng Chen, Tongyi Cao, Shuangjie Xu, Maosheng Ye, Zhili Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a new interaction mechanism of prediction and planning for end-to-end autonomous driving, called PPAD (Iterative Interaction of Prediction and Planning Autonomous Driving), which considers the timestep-wise interaction to better integrate prediction and planning. An ego vehicle performs motion planning at each timestep based on the trajectory prediction of surrounding agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and its local road conditions. Unlike existing end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks, PPAD models the interactions among ego, agents, and the dynamic environment in an autoregressive manner by interleaving the Prediction and Planning processes at every timestep, instead of a single sequential process of prediction followed by planning. Specifically, we design ego-to-agent, ego-to-map, and ego-to-BEV interaction mechanisms with hierarchical dynamic key objects attention to better model the interactions.

Pareto-Optimal Quantized ResNet Is Mostly 4-bit\n\n*From Search Query: neural network state compression techniques*\n\n*Lukasz Lew, Chas Leichner, Oleg Rybakov, Jonathan Malmaud, Shivani Agrawal, Lisa Wang, Amirali Abdolrashidi*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization has become a popular technique to compress neural networks and reduce compute cost, but most prior work focuses on studying quantization without changing the network size. Many real-world applications of neural networks have compute cost and memory budgets, which can be traded off with model quality by changing the number of parameters. In this work, we use ResNet as a case study to systematically investigate the effects of quantization on inference compute cost-quality tradeoff curves. Our results suggest that for each bfloat16 ResNet model, there are quantized models with lower cost and higher accuracy; in other words, the bfloat16 compute cost-quality tradeoff curve is Pareto-dominated by the 4-bit and 8-bit curves, with models primarily quantized to 4-bit yielding the best Pareto curve. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet for 4-bit ResNet-50 with quantization-aware training, obtaining a top-1 eval accuracy of 77.09%. We demonstrate the regularizing effect of quantization by measuring the generalization gap. The quantization method we used is optimized for practicality: It requires little tuning and is designed with hardware capabilities in mind. Our work motivates further research into optimal numeric formats for quantization, as well as the development of machine learning accelerators supporting these formats. As part of this work, we contribute a quantization library written in JAX, which is open-sourced at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/aqt.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architectures*\n\n*Yvonne W.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architectures*\n\n*Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Berk T\u0131naz, Zalan Fabian*\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the efficiency and scalability of the FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating advanced hierarchical attention mechanisms and novel neural network state compression techniques, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Multi-Level Attention:**\n   - The concept of multi-level attention, as seen in **Hierarchical Neural Story Generation**, can be adapted to capture both local and global dependencies.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Score: 0.61)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

The figure compares two pooling strategies, Top- $P_{s}$ (ours) and Top- $K \\%$. As shown, the Top- $K \\%$ approach lags behind the Top- $P_{s}$ approach, demonstrating that our strategy allows the model to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences. Results are for Mamba-130m. Layer 17\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-12.jpg?height=463&width=758&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=1050)\n\nFigure 12: Pooling Strategy Ablation. Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

Each pair of images is identical, except that the left one marks the location of the passkey with a dashed pink line. The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively. As can be seen from the two cases examined above, the $\\Delta_{t}$ activation captures the needle location successfully, demonstrating the effectiveness of its 'importance scoring' mechanism. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=644&width=1604&top_left_y=1637&top_left_x=226)\n\nFigure 14: Measuring the Effects of Limited ERFs. We show the $\\Delta_{t}$ values across the channels for layer 16 in the Mamba-130M model, examined on different context lengths. The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively. As can be observed from the results above, the passkey can be detected clearly until the ERF ends (for $t>10 K$ ). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-15.jpg?height=1177&width=1611&top_left_y=865&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 15: Normalized Mamba Attention Map.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

This is highly beneficial for the GAU to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs):**\n  - Integrating SSMs with dense hidden connections, as in **DenseMamba**, can complement hierarchical attention mechanisms. This facilitates efficient handling of long sequences while maintaining compressed state representations.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Gradient Checkpointing:**\n  - Utilizing gradient checkpointing techniques can help manage memory usage during training, especially when integrating complex hierarchical and multi-scale mechanisms. This ensures the GAU remains memory-efficient without sacrificing training dynamics.\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations:**\n  - Leveraging hardware-efficient operations and parallel processing capabilities, as demonstrated in models like **Linformer** and **Neighborhood Attention Transformer**, is essential to ensure the enhanced GAU performs optimally on standard hardware.\n\n### Empirical Validation\n\n- **Benchmark Performance:**\n  - Rigorous empirical validation on large-scale benchmarks such as the **fastMRI** dataset or ImageNet is necessary to demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed GAU improvements. This will help in comparing the performance of the enhanced GAU against existing models and identifying areas for further refinement.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Advanced Hierarchical Attention Models:**\n  - Investigating recent hierarchical transformer models like **MATNet** and **Hierarchical Neural Story Generation** can provide insights into best practices for multi-scale attention integration within GAUs.\n\n- **State Space Models Integration:**\n  - Delving deeper into the architectures of **Mamba** and **DenseMamba** can help in understanding the integration of SSMs within GAUs and enhancing temporal modeling capabilities.\n\n- **Adaptive Compression Techniques:**\n  - Exploring dynamic and selective state compression methods from **Adaptive State Compression in Neural Networks** and **SelectiveGatedMHA** can help in implementing adaptive compression within GAUs, optimizing the balance between compression rates and model performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can effectively enhance the FastTTTLinear GAU to achieve better memory efficiency, scalability, and performance in capturing both local and global dependencies in long sequences.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 5. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015).

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2.

We improve upon recent advances in both the language modeling domain and the model-compression domain to construct parameter and computation efficient language models. We use an efficient transformer-based architecture with adaptive embedding and softmax, differentiable non-parametric cache, Hebbian softmax, knowledge distillation, network pruning, and low-bit quantization. In this paper, we provide the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2019 MicroNet Challenge in the language modeling track. Compared to the baseline language model provided by the MicroNet Challenge, our model is 90 times more parameter-efficient and 36 times more computation-efficient while achieving the required test perplexity of 35 on the Wikitext-103 dataset.

MIMT: Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Video Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer*\n\n*Jin-Peng Xiang, Kuan Tian, Jun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCLJCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning video compression outperforms its hand-craft counterparts with enhanced flexibility and capacity. One key component of the learned video codec is the autoregressive entropy model conditioned on spatial and temporal priors. Operating autoregressive on raster scanning order naively treats the context as unidirectional. This is neither efficient nor optimal considering that conditional information probably locates at the end of the sequence. We thus introduce an entropy model based on a masked image modeling transformer (MIMT) to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies. Video frames are first encoded into sequences of tokens and then processed with the transformer encoder as priors. The transformer decoder learns the probability mass functions (PMFs) conditioned on the priors and masked inputs, and then it is capable of selecting optimal decoding orders without a fixed direction. During training, MIMT aims to predict the PMFs of randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. This allows MIMT to capture the temporal dependencies from encoded priors and the spatial dependencies from the unmasked tokens, i.e., decoded tokens. At inference time, the model begins with generating PMFs of all masked tokens in parallel and then decodes the frame iteratively from the previously-selected decoded tokens (i.e., with high confidence). In addition, we improve the overall performance with more techniques, e.g., manifold conditional priors accumulating a long range of information, shifted window attention to reduce complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCLJCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning by Modeling Previous Task Interrelations via Pareto Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory optimization*\n\n*Yichen Wu, Hong Wang, Peilin Zhao, Yefeng Zheng, Ying Wei, Long-Kai Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reformulates replay-based CL methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework and incorporates the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned tasks and de-sign a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current task.\n\n**Abstract:** Catastrophic forgetting remains a core challenge in continual learning (CL), where the models struggle to retain previous knowledge when learning new tasks. While existing replay-based CL methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge by utilizing a memory buffer to store data from previous tasks, they generally overlook the interdependence between previously learned tasks and fail to encapsulate the optimally integrated knowledge in previous tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance of the previous tasks. Against this issue, we first reformulate replay-based CL methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework. We then incorporate the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned tasks and de-sign a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current task. To further stabilize the gradients of different tasks, we carefully devise a hyper-gradient-based implementation manner for POCL. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate that the proposed POCL outperforms current state-of-the-art CL methods across multiple datasets and different settings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Learned Optimizers that Scale and Generalize\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory optimization*\n\n*Olga Wichrowska, Niru Maheswaranathan, Matthew W. Hoffman, Sergio Gomez Colmenarejo, Misha Denil, Nando de Freitas, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead, by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture with minimal per-parameter overhead.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to learn has emerged as an important direction for achieving artificial intelligence. Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an inability to scale to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to new tasks. We introduce a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead. We achieve this by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture, with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented with additional architectural features that mirror the known structure of optimization tasks. We also develop a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse, optimization tasks capturing common properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform RMSProp/ADAM on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably or better when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no neural networks in its meta-training set. Finally, it generalizes to train Inception V3 and ResNet V2 architectures on the ImageNet dataset for thousands of steps, optimization problems that are of a vastly different scale than those it was trained on.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 24*)\n\n#### 8. Efficient Iterative Amortized Inference for Learning Symmetric and Disentangled Multi-Object Representations\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory optimization*\n\n*Patrick Emami, Pan He, S. Ranka, A. Rangarajan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representation learning that demonstrates strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised multi-object representation learning depends on inductive biases to guide the discovery of object-centric representations that generalize. However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Variable-Rate Deep Image Compression through Spatially-Adaptive Feature Transform\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer*\n\n*Bohyung Han, Jinyoung Choi, Myungseo Song*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a versatile deep image compression network based on Spatial Feature Transform (SFT arXiv:1804.02815), which takes a source image and a corresponding quality map as inputs and produce a compressed image with variable rates. Our model covers a wide range of compression rates using a single model, which is controlled by arbitrary pixel-wise quality maps. In addition, the proposed framework allows us to perform task-aware image compressions for various tasks, e.g., classification, by efficiently estimating optimized quality maps specific to target tasks for our encoding network. This is even possible with a pretrained network without learning separate models for individual tasks. Our algorithm achieves outstanding rate-distortion trade-off compared to the approaches based on multiple models that are optimized separately for several different target rates. At the same level of compression, the proposed approach successfully improves performance on image classification and text region quality preservation via task-aware quality map estimation without additional model training.

Region-Adaptive Transform with Segmentation Prior for Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer*\n\n*Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei, Huihui Bai, Wenhan Yang, Yuxi Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Learned Image Compression (LIC) has shown remarkable progress in recent years. Existing works commonly employ CNN-based or self-attention-based modules as transform methods for compression. However, there is no prior research on neural transform that focuses on specific regions. In response, we introduce the class-agnostic segmentation masks (i.e. semantic masks without category labels) for extracting region-adaptive contextual information. Our proposed module, Region-Adaptive Transform, applies adaptive convolutions on different regions guided by the masks. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play module named Scale Affine Layer to incorporate rich contexts from various regions. While there have been prior image compression efforts that involve segmentation masks as additional intermediate inputs, our approach differs significantly from them. Our advantages lie in that, to avoid extra bitrate overhead, we treat these masks as privilege information, which is accessible during the model training stage but not required during the inference phase. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ class-agnostic masks as privilege information and achieve superior performance in pixel-fidelity metrics, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). The experimental results demonstrate our improvement compared to previously well-performing methods, with about 8.2% bitrate saving compared to VTM-17.0.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. RNNs can generate bounded hierarchical languages with optimal memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory optimization*\n\n*Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang, Surya Ganguli, Michael Hahn, John Hewitt*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks empirically generate natural language with high syntactic fidelity. However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. BLISlab: A Sandbox for Optimizing GEMM\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory optimization*\n\n*Robert A. van de Geijn, Jianyu Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix-matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation of great importance to scientific computing and, increasingly, machine learning. It is a simple enough concept to be introduced in a typical high school algebra course yet in practice important enough that its implementation on computers continues to be an active research topic. This note describes a set of exercises that use this operation to illustrate how high performance can be attained on modern CPUs with hierarchical memories (multiple caches). It does so by building on the insights that underly the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework by exposing a simplified \"sandbox\" that mimics the implementation in BLIS. As such, it also becomes a vehicle for the \"crowd sourcing\" of the optimization of BLIS. We call this set of exercises BLISlab.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, here are some key findings and strategies related to the specified keywords and details:\n\n### Adaptive Compression in Transformers\n\n#### Implementation Techniques\n- **Spatiotemporal Adaptive Compression**: The LongVU approach involves a three-step process to compress video tokens while preserving visual details. This can be adapted for text data by focusing on temporal and spatial dependencies within the sequence. For example, selective feature reduction via cross-modal queries can be applied to retain key tokens while compressing less important ones.\n- **Parameter Sketching and Compression**: The SpaLLM method involves row-wise parameter sketching, where model parameters are compressed into sketched parameters. This approach allows for fine-tuning directly on compressed parameters, which can be beneficial for reducing memory requirements without significant loss in model performance.\n\n#### Performance Impact\n- Adaptive compression techniques can significantly reduce the number of tokens or parameters, leading to faster training and inference times. For instance, LongVU's compression strategy allows for processing long videos within a given context length with minimal visual information loss.\n- SpaLLM's approach maintains the model's generalization ability while reducing the memory footprint, making it efficient for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\n#### Memory-Efficiency Trade-offs\n- **Compression vs. Expressiveness**: There is a trade-off between compression and the model's expressiveness.

This includes optimizing memory access patterns and leveraging hardware-specific optimizations.\n- **Trade-offs**: Balancing compression with model expressiveness and computational overhead is essential. Techniques like parameter sharing and regularization can help in maintaining performance while reducing memory footprint.\n\n#### Performance Metrics\n- **Memory Footprint**: Reducing the memory footprint is a key metric, which can be achieved through compression and pruning techniques.\n- **Inference Time**: Optimizing inference time is critical, and techniques like memristor-based computing and sparse transformer models can significantly reduce it.\n- **Accuracy**: Maintaining high accuracy levels despite compression and optimization is a key performance metric. Techniques like SpaLLM and dynamic pruning aim to preserve model performance.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and performant, addressing the challenges of memory efficiency, computational overhead, and hardware utilization.\n",

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/24 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07289, 2015.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.19)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.

Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Parallel and Efficient Hierarchical k-Median Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Vincent Cohen-Addad, Silvio Lattanzi, A. Norouzi-Fard, C. Sohler, O. Svensson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a fundamental unsupervised learning task, hierarchical clustering has been extensively studied in the past decade. In particular, standard metric formulations as hierarchical k -center, k -means, and k -median received a lot of attention and the problems have been studied extensively in different models of computation. Despite all this interest, not many ef\ufb01cient parallel algorithms are known for these problems. In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that, when using machines with memory s (for s \u2208 \u2126(log 2 ( n + \u2206 + d )) ), outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every \ufb01xed value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution. Furthermore, we also get that in for all k simultanuously the cost of the solution is at most an expected O (min { d, log n } log \u2206 log(\u2206 dn )) factor bigger that the corresponding optimal solution. The algorithm requires in O (log s ( nd log( n + \u2206))) rounds. Here d is the dimension of the data set and \u2206 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance of two points in the input dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst parallel algorithm for the hierarchical k -median problem with theoretical guarantees. We further complement our theoretical results with an empirical study of our algorithm that shows its effectiveness in practice.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Lingkai Kong, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, is proposed, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback, and develops a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the potential in acting as autonomous agents for sequential decision-making tasks. However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 7.

GNOT: A General Neural Operator Transformer for Operator Learning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architecture*\n\n*Zhongkai Hao, Chengyang Ying, Zhengyi Wang, Hang Su, Yinpeng Dong, Songming Liu, Ze Cheng, Jun Zhu, Jian Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a general neural operator transformer (GNOT), a scalable and effective transformer-based framework for learning operators that is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular meshes and introduces a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning partial differential equations' (PDEs) solution operators is an essential problem in machine learning. However, there are several challenges for learning operators in practical applications like the irregular mesh, multiple input functions, and complexity of the PDEs' solution. To address these challenges, we propose a general neural operator transformer (GNOT), a scalable and effective transformer-based framework for learning operators. By designing a novel heterogeneous normalized attention layer, our model is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular meshes. Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems. The large model capacity of the transformer architecture grants our model the possibility to scale to large datasets and practical problems. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets from different domains and achieve a remarkable improvement compared with alternative methods.

In this context, Both RNN\u2019s and Transformer have been used as an encoder-decoder architecture with multiple layers in each module. Far beyond this, these architectures are the basis for the contextual word embeddings which are revolutionizing most natural language downstream applications. However, intermediate representations in either the RNN or Transformer architectures can be difficult to interpret. To make these layer representations more accessible and meaningful, we introduce a web-based tool that visualizes them both at the sentence and token level. We present three use cases. The first analyses gender issues in contextual word embeddings. The second and third are showing multilingual intermediate representations for sentences and tokens and the evolution of these intermediate representations along with the multiple layers of the decoder and in the context of multilingual machine translation.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Image and Video Tokenization with Binary Spherical Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Yuanjun Xiong, Yue Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new transformer-based image and video tokenizer with Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ). BSQ projects the high-dimensional visual embedding to a lower-dimensional hypersphere and then applies binary quantization. BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. ERNIE-Tiny : A Progressive Distillation Framework for Pretrained Transformer Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, Hua Wu, Hao Tian, Yu Sun, Weixin Liu, Jiaxiang Liu, Shikun Feng, Xuyi Chen, Weiyue Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT adopt a training paradigm which first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on task-specific data, and have recently achieved great success. However, PLMs are notorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life applications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this problem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller student over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key components, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial to the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage progressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the three components gradually from general level to task-specific level. Specifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with guidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss. Then, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained teacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts training data from general data to task-specific data. In the end, Task-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and Hard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In particular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over 98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of parameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five Chinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer parameters and9.4x faster inference speed.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 5. fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architecture*\n\n*Yvonne W.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale transformer architecture*\n\n*Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Berk T\u0131naz, Zalan Fabian*\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating hierarchical attention, adaptive state compression, and multi-scale processing, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and the detailed analysis:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Implementation Details**:\n  - The \"Block Transformer\" approach introduces a hierarchical global-to-local modeling strategy. This method mitigates the KV cache IO bottleneck in batch inference by dividing the attention mechanism into global and local components, enhancing inference efficiency in large language models.\n\n- **Performance Characteristics**:\n  - Hierarchical attention mechanisms can capture information at various granularities. For instance, the LiGAR model uses a hierarchical architecture to capture group activities from individual actions to scene-level dynamics, which can be adapted for language models to handle different scales of context.\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**:\n  - The hierarchical global-to-local modeling in the Block Transformer reduces memory access and computational overhead, making it more memory-efficient. This approach can be integrated with other architectures to enhance overall memory efficiency.\n\n- **Integration Approaches**:\n  - Integrating hierarchical attention with architectures like FastTTTLinear involves implementing multi-level attention mechanisms. This can be done by layering attention mechanisms where earlier layers focus on local context and later layers on global context, similar to the Block Transformer approach.\n\n### Adaptive State Compression Techniques\n\n- **Compression Methods for Transformer States**:\n  - Adaptive state compression can be achieved through dynamic compression strategies. For example, compressing states based on their importance or relevance to the current context can help in reducing memory usage without significant performance degradation.\n\n- **Dynamic Compression Strategies**:\n  - Dynamic compression involves adjusting the compression level based on the model's current state and the input sequence. This can be implemented using techniques that monitor the model's performance and adjust the compression rate accordingly to maintain a balance between memory usage and performance.\n\n- **Memory-Performance Trade-offs**:\n  - The trade-offs between compression and performance need careful analysis. Studies have shown that networks with optimal structural complexity (e.g., using the Ladderpath approach) can achieve superior performance. Similarly, finding the right balance in state compression is crucial to avoid significant performance drops while reducing memory usage.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations**:\n  - Implementing adaptive state compression requires monitoring and adjusting the compression level in real-time. This can be complex and may involve additional computational overhead. However, it can be optimized using hardware-aware techniques to minimize the impact on performance.\n\n### Multi-scale Processing in Language Models\n\n- **Architectural Approaches**:\n  - Multi-scale processing can be achieved through hierarchical architectures similar to the LiGAR model, which captures information at various granularities. This can be adapted for language models by using multi-level attention mechanisms that process context at different scales.\n\n- **Efficiency Implications**:\n  - Hierarchical processing can reduce computational complexity by focusing on relevant context at different scales. This approach can also improve memory efficiency by reducing the need to process all context uniformly.\n\n- **Performance Impact**:\n  - Multi-scale processing can improve the handling of long-range dependencies and capture more nuanced contextual information, leading to better performance in language tasks.\n\n- **Integration Strategies**:\n  - Integrating multi-scale processing with existing architectures like FastTTTLinear involves layering attention mechanisms and ensuring seamless communication between different levels of the hierarchy. This can be optimized using techniques like the Block Transformer's global-to-local approach.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimization\n\n- **Memory Access Patterns**:\n  - Optimizing memory access patterns is crucial for efficient inference. The Block Transformer's hierarchical global-to-local modeling helps in reducing KV cache IO bottlenecks, which can be a significant improvement in hardware utilization.\n\n- **Parallel Processing Techniques**:\n  - Parallel processing can be enhanced by dividing the computation into global and local components, similar to the Block Transformer. This allows for better utilization of hardware resources and improves overall computational efficiency.\n\n- **Hardware Utilization**:\n  - Hardware-aware optimization involves designing models that are aware of the underlying hardware constraints. Techniques such as adaptive state compression and hierarchical processing can be optimized to reduce memory access and improve parallel processing capabilities, leading to better hardware utilization.\n\n- **Implementation Efficiency**:\n  - Implementing these optimizations requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between performance, memory usage, and computational complexity. Using tools like the Ladderpath approach can help in quantitatively characterizing the structural complexity of the model and optimizing it for better performance and efficiency.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Scalability and Training Stability**:\n  - Ensuring the model scales well with sequence length and maintains training stability is crucial. Hierarchical processing and adaptive state compression can help in this regard by reducing computational and memory overhead, but careful tuning of hyperparameters and monitoring of training processes are necessary.\n\n- **Real-World Performance Implications**:\n  - The real-world performance implications of these optimizations should be evaluated thoroughly. This includes testing the model on various datasets and tasks to ensure that the improvements in efficiency do not compromise performance.\n\nBy integrating these concepts\u2014hierarchical attention mechanisms, adaptive state compression, multi-scale processing, and hardware-aware optimization\u2014the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and high-performance autoregressive language model.\n",

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.11)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.01)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

FLuRKA: Fast and accurate unified Low-Rank&Kernel Attention (Avg.

Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/83 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers have been widely adopted across various domains, powering popular applications like ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, and Claude, which handle millions of queries per day Meyer et al. [2023]. To effectively train and deploy high-quality models at this scale, transformers must be training efficient. This entails balancing two crucial factors. (1) Model speed, which corresponds to models with low step-times and fewer FLOPs per step. (2) Model quality, which corresponds to expressive models that yield low losses with few training tokens. Highly training-efficient transformers are fast and of high quality. However, achieving both simultaneously is challenging, as higher quality transformers often require larger parameter counts and data-set sizes Li et al. [2020], Hoffmann et al. [2022], leading to slower model speeds. This trade-off is further exacerbated by the quadratic dependence in run-time\non increasing input sequence lengths ( 32 k for GPT-4, 100k for Claude, and 1.5 M for Gemini-pro OpenAI 2023], Anthropic [2023], Team et al. [2024]). To design training-efficient transformers, researchers have developed linear time self-attention approximations, falling into three main categories: sparse Child et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 12 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: FastTTTLinear implementation techniques, transformer memory optimization, hierarchical state compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. A Fast and Accurate Splitting Method for Optimal Transport: Analysis and Implementation\n\n*From Search Query: FastTTTLinear implementation techniques*\n\n*Vien V. Mai, Jacob Lindb\u00e4ck, M. Johansson*\n\n**Abstract:** We develop a fast and reliable method for solving large-scale optimal transport (OT) problems at an unprecedented combination of speed and accuracy. Built on the celebrated Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, our method tackles the original OT problem directly instead of solving an approximate regularized problem, as many state-of-the-art techniques do. This allows us to provide sparse transport plans and avoid numerical issues of methods that use entropic regularization. The algorithm has the same cost per iteration as the popular Sinkhorn method, and each iteration can be executed efficiently, in parallel. The proposed method enjoys an iteration complexity $O(1/\\epsilon)$ compared to the best-known $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ of the Sinkhorn method. In addition, we establish a linear convergence rate for our formulation of the OT problem. We detail an efficient GPU implementation of the proposed method that maintains a primal-dual stopping criterion at no extra cost. Substantial experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, both in terms of computation times and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Soloveichik*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm, setting the stage for rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.\n\n**Abstract:** Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology, medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to generate a chemical reaction network that can discriminate between different virus types based on gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Preference Fine-Tuning of LLMs Should Leverage Suboptimal, On-Policy Data\n\n*From Search Query: FastTTTLinear implementation techniques*\n\n*Fahim Tajwar, Anikait Singh, Archit Sharma, Rafael Rafailov, Jeff Schneider, Tengyang Xie, Stefano Ermon, Chelsea Finn, Aviral Kumar*\n\n**TL;DR:** A rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems finds that approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models. There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning. Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why? In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a\"negative gradient\") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively. Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. SAViT: Structure-Aware Vision Transformer Pruning via Collaborative Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Zheyang Li, Kai Zhang, Zhi Yang, Wenming Tan, Jun Xiao, Ye Ren, Shiliang Pu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Joint importance is introduced, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning in ViTs, and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) yield impressive performance across various vision tasks. However, heavy computation and memory footprint make them inaccessible for edge devices. Previous works apply importance criteria determined independently by each individual component to prune ViTs. Considering that heterogeneous components in ViTs play distinct roles, these approaches lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce joint importance, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning. Based on the theoretical analysis, we construct a Taylor-based approximation to evaluate the joint importance. This guides pruning toward a more balanced reduction across all components. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, we incorporate the interactions into the optimization function under some mild assumptions. Moreover, the proposed method can be seamlessly applied to various tasks including object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet, increasing accuracy by 0.7% over the DeiT-Base baseline while saving 50% FLOPs. On COCO, we are the first to show that 70% FLOPs of Faster R-CNN with ViT backbone can be removed with only 0.3% mAP drop.

Adafactor: Adaptive Learning Rates with Sublinear Memory Cost\n\n*From Search Query: transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Noam M. Shazeer, Mitchell Stern*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work demonstrates empirically that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow, and proposes update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies.\n\n**Abstract:** In several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods (e.g. RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta), parameter updates are scaled by the inverse square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. Maintaining these per-parameter second-moment estimators requires memory equal to the number of parameters. For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums. We demonstrate empirically that this method produces similar results to the baseline. Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies. Combining these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to the published Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task, while using very little auxiliary storage in the optimizer. Finally, we propose scaling the parameter updates based on the scale of the parameters themselves.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 900  (*Influential: 159*)\n\n#### 6. HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

Optimizing the Memory Hierarchy by Compositing Automatic Transformations on Computations and Data\n\n*From Search Query: transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Peng Di, Jie Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing compilers exploit the memory hierarchy using loop tiling and fusion, but these two transformations usually interfere with each other due to the oversight of transformations on data in memories. We present a novel composition of loop tiling and fusion in this paper. Unlike existing tiling-after-fusion algorithms that only transform computation spaces, our approach first applies rectangular/parallelogram tiling to live-out computation spaces for fitting the memory hierarchy, followed by the computation of the memory footprints required by each tile. The upwards exposed data extracted from the memory footprints are used to determine the tile shapes of intermediate computation spaces, allowing the construction of arbitrary tile shapes. Finally, our technique implements a post-tiling fusion strategy for maximizing data locality without losing tilability or parallelism of live-out computation spaces, thereby enabling storage reduction and reuse, and optimizing the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior performance on both CPU and GPU architectures over the state of the art by experimenting on 11 benchmarks extracted from numerous domains including neural networks, image processing, sparse matrix computation and linear algebra. Also, the results of the ResNet-50 model on an AI accelerator show that our approach can obtain 16% performance improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** 53rd-annual-ieee-acm-international-symposium\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Joint Autoregressive and Hierarchical Priors for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Johannes Ball\u00e9, David Minnen, George Toderici*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders,\nlearning approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent\nrepresentation. These are combined with an entropy model, a prior on the latent\nrepresentation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to\nyield a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models have been\nintroduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than simple fully\nfactorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining\nend-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in\nprobabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, as\nwell as combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in\nthe context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive\nmodels come with a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of\ncompression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are\ncomplementary and, together, exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents\nbetter than all previous learned models. The combined model yields\nstate-of-the-art rate--distortion performance, providing a 15.8% average\nreduction in file size over the previous state-of-the-art method based on deep\nlearning, which corresponds to a 59.8% size reduction over JPEG, more than 35%\nreduction compared to WebP and JPEG2000, and bitstreams 8.4% smaller than BPG,\nthe current state-of-the-art image codec. To the best of our knowledge, our\nmodel is the first learning-based method to outperform BPG on both PSNR and\nMS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Conference:** joint-autoregressive-and-hierarchical-priors-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on the integration of FastTTTLinear architecture, memory optimization in transformers, and hierarchical state compression, here are some specific details and techniques that can be useful:\n\n## FastTTTLinear Architecture and Implementation\n\n### Core Components and Mechanisms\n- The FastTTTLinear architecture is designed to efficiently handle linear transformations in transformers, particularly in the context of attention mechanisms. It leverages hierarchical processing to reduce computational complexity. For example, the H-Transformer-1D uses a hierarchical method to compute attention with linear run time and memory complexity, which is superior to sub-quadratic proposals.\n\n### Integration Points for Hierarchical Processing\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms can be integrated by structuring the model into multiple levels, each handling different scales of input sequences. This approach allows for efficient computation of attention weights by localizing attention to specific segments of the input sequence, as seen in the Neighborhood Attention Transformer.\n\n### Memory Management Techniques\n- Memory management in FastTTTLinear involves optimizing the storage and access patterns of the hierarchical attention weights. Techniques such as batch-size-first or batch-size-last memory layouts can be employed to ensure contiguous memory access, which is crucial for high-performance multiplication routines.\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n- The performance of FastTTTLinear is characterized by its linear time and memory complexity, which significantly improves efficiency compared to quadratic complexity of standard self-attention mechanisms. This makes it particularly suitable for handling long-range dependencies in sequences.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Transformers\n\n### State Compression Techniques\n- State compression can be achieved through various techniques such as module-wise dynamic scaling and token-level contrastive distillation. Module-wise dynamic scaling allows quantizers to adapt to different modules, reducing memory requirements while maintaining performance. Token-level contrastive distillation helps in learning distinguishable word embeddings, further reducing memory needs.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Memory-efficient attention mechanisms involve localizing self-attention to the nearest neighboring elements, as in the Neighborhood Attention Transformer. This approach reduces the time and space complexity from quadratic to linear, making it more memory-efficient.\n\n### Trade-offs Between Memory and Performance\n- The trade-off between memory and performance is critical. Techniques like adaptive quantization can significantly reduce memory requirements but may slightly impact model performance. Balancing compression and model expressiveness is essential to maintain performance while optimizing memory usage.\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n- Implementation strategies include hardware-aware design, where memory access patterns are optimized to match the capabilities of the hardware. This can involve using specialized kernels and optimizing data layout to minimize memory operations, as discussed in the context of Kronecker-sparse matrices.\n\n## Hierarchical State Compression\n\n### Compression Techniques in Transformer Models\n- Hierarchical state compression can be achieved through techniques like hierarchical attention and multi-level processing. This involves compressing states at different levels of the hierarchy, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of attention weights.\n\n### Impact on Model Performance\n- The impact on model performance is generally positive, as hierarchical compression maintains the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies while reducing memory requirements. However, careful tuning is necessary to ensure that compression does not significantly degrade performance.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n- Integration with attention mechanisms involves ensuring that the compressed states are compatible with the attention computation. Techniques like RoI pooling in object detection models can be analogous, where fixed-size feature maps are generated from variable-sized inputs, facilitating efficient processing.\n\n### Practical Implementation Considerations\n- Practical considerations include ensuring that the compression techniques are hardware-aware and optimized for memory access patterns. This involves careful design of the memory layout and the use of efficient multiplication routines, such as those described for Kronecker-sparse matrices.\n\nIn summary, the integration of FastTTTLinear architecture with hierarchical state compression and memory-efficient attention mechanisms can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models. Key strategies include:\n\n- Using hierarchical attention mechanisms to reduce computational complexity.\n- Employing module-wise dynamic scaling and token-level contrastive distillation for state compression.\n- Optimizing memory access patterns and using hardware-aware design.\n- Balancing compression and model expressiveness to maintain performance.\n\nThese techniques can help in achieving better overall performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures. The source code is released at github.com/OpenNLPLab/TransnormerLLM.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/39 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n1. Accuracy.

Training speed and accuracy comparison. We compare TNL's training speed and losses with state-of-the-art transformer models (LLaMA with FlashAttention-2) and efficient non-transformer models (HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) and TNN (Qin et al., 2023a)). TNL achieves the lowest training losses and maintains consistent training speed regardless of sequence length. good spur. We propose a novel architecture, TransNormerLLM (TNL), which is specifically designed for Lightning Attention in order to enhance its performance. TNL evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer (Qin et al., 2022a) by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanism, tensor normalization. Specifically, we use LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. A gating mechanism is utilized to smooth training, and a new tensor normalization scheme is proposed to accelerate the model while preserving its accuracy. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models. As shown in Fig. 1, TNL achieves the lowest training loss among the existing efficient transformer structures (Qin et al., 2023a;c) as well as SOTA transformer models (Touvron et al., 2023b). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023). Lightning Attention exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed and memory consumption compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. We also validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of $44 \\mathrm{M}, 385 \\mathrm{M}, 1 \\mathrm{~B}, 7 \\mathrm{~B}$, and 15 B on standard or our self-collected datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that TNL not only matches the performance of SOTA LLMs with Transformer but is also significantly faster. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1. Efficient Language Modeling\n\nNew efficient model architectures are being explored to address the high time complexity of the traditional transformer structure. Four promising alternatives, including linear transformers, state space models, long convolution, and linear recurrence, are being developed to replace self-attention modules for long sequence modeling. Linear Attention Linear attention decomposes Softmax Attention into the inner product of hidden representations, allowing it to use the \"Kernel Trick\", where the product of keys and values is computed first to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/14 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nGeoffrey E.

Sharan, Ajay Jaiswal, Kevin Wang, Yihan Xi, Dejia Xu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes, demonstrating that the progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.\n\n**Abstract:** For a complicated algorithm, its implementation by a human programmer usually starts with outlining a rough control flow followed by iterative enrichments, eventually yielding carefully generated syntactic structures and variables in a hierarchy. However, state-of-the-art large language models generate codes in a single pass, without intermediate warm-ups to reflect the structured thought process of\"outline-then-detail\". Inspired by the recent success of chain-of-thought prompting, we propose ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes. We first decompose source code into layout frame components and accessory components via abstract syntax tree parsing to construct a hierarchical representation. We then reform our prediction target into a multi-pass objective, each pass generates a subsequence, which is concatenated in the hierarchy. Finally, a tailored transformer architecture is leveraged to jointly encode the natural language descriptions and syntactically aligned I/O data samples. Extensive evaluations show that ChainCoder outperforms state-of-the-arts, demonstrating that our progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.

However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \\ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-$\\pi$-1B Pro and PanGu-$\\pi$-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-$\\pi$-1B Pro. Besides, PanGu-$\\pi$-1.5B Pro surpasses a range of SOTA models with larger model sizes, validating its superior performance.

Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Chaitanya K. Ryali, Yuan-Ting Hu, Daniel Bolya, Chen Wei, Haoqi Fan, Po-Yao (Bernie) Huang, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Arkabandhu Chowdhury, Omid Poursaeed, Judy Hoffman, J. Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Memory Efficient Neural Processes via Constant Memory Attention Block\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Y. Bengio, M. O. Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Pit One Against Many: Leveraging Attention-head Embeddings for Parameter-efficient Multi-head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Huiyin Xue, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head, and empirically demonstrates that this MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling pre-trained language models has resulted in large performance gains in various natural language processing tasks but comes with a large cost in memory requirements. Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design using the keywords and details provided, here are some specific insights and references that can be useful:\n\n### FastTTTLinear Architecture\n\n#### Detailed Component Structure\nThe FastTTTLinear architecture is a variant of transformer models that aims to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance.

However, as the demand for handling longer sequences grows, existing models, including those utilizing the FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU), encounter significant challenges related to memory efficiency and scalability. The FastTTTLinear GAU, while efficient, struggles to effectively capture hierarchical relationships and manage memory for very long sequences. These limitations hinder the model's ability to maintain performance and generalize effectively across diverse and lengthy inputs. To address these challenges, there is a critical need to develop an enhanced GAU that integrates hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive state compression techniques, thereby improving the model's capacity to handle long-range dependencies without compromising efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\nRecent advancements in transformer architectures and memory-efficient attention mechanisms have laid the groundwork for enhancing autoregressive language models:\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:** Models like *Hierarchical Neural Story Generation* and *A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer* have demonstrated the efficacy of multi-level attention structures in capturing both local and global dependencies. These approaches utilize hierarchical or quad-tree-like architectures to manage different levels of detail, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex sequence patterns.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Attention:** Techniques such as *Linformer* and *Neighborhood Attention Transformer* have significantly reduced the computational and memory overhead associated with self-attention by approximating the attention mechanism with low-rank matrix projections and localized computations, respectively. These methods transform the quadratic complexity of traditional attention into linear or near-linear complexity, facilitating scalability to longer sequences.\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression:** Innovations like *Adaptive State Compression in Neural Networks* and *SelectiveGatedMHA* introduce dynamic compression rates based on input complexity, ensuring that essential information is retained while optimizing memory usage. These strategies allow models to selectively retain critical state information and discard redundancies, thereby enhancing memory efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n\n- **Dual-Stream Processing and State Space Models (SSMs):** The *Temporal Latent Bottleneck* and *DenseMamba* models incorporate dual-stream architectures and SSMs to separate short-term and long-term state updates. This separation facilitates efficient memory management and better capture of hierarchical relationships, enabling models to handle long sequences more effectively.\n\nThese seminal works have informed the design choices for HierarchicalFastTTTLinearPlus, providing proven methodologies for integrating hierarchical structures and memory-efficient mechanisms within GAUs.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with FastTTTLinear GAU\n\n1. **Memory Management:**\n   - **High Memory Requirements:** FastTTTLinear struggles with the memory demands of processing extremely long sequences, which limits its scalability.\n   - **Inefficient State Representation:** The fixed-size hidden states are insufficient for capturing the nuances of long-range dependencies, leading to information bottlenecks.\n   - **Limited Compression Capabilities:** FastTTTLinear lacks mechanisms for effectively compressing and decompressing state information, hindering its ability to manage extensive contexts.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Understanding:**\n   - **Lack of Multi-Scale Processing:** FastTTTLinear does not inherently capture hierarchical relationships within the data, limiting its ability to understand complex patterns.\n   - **Ineffective Long-Range Dependency Handling:** Without hierarchical structures, the GAU cannot efficiently model dependencies that span large portions of the sequence.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency:**\n   - **Suboptimal Parallelization:** The GAU's architecture does not fully leverage parallel processing capabilities, resulting in slower training and inference times for long sequences.\n   - **Inefficient State Updates:** The absence of advanced state management techniques leads to inefficient computations during state transitions.\n\n### Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nTo overcome these limitations, HierarchicalFastTTTLinearPlus introduces a **hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanism** combined with **adaptive state compression techniques** within the FastTTTLinear GAU. This integration is inspired by established models that successfully implement hierarchical structures and memory-efficient mechanisms to handle long sequences. The core philosophy is to enhance the GAU's ability to manage and understand hierarchical relationships in data while optimizing memory usage through dynamic compression, thereby achieving a balance between efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\n1. **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention:**\n   - **Multi-Level Attention Formulation:**\n     \\[\n     Y = \\sum_{l=1}^{L} \\alpha_l \\cdot \\text{Attention}_l(Q, K, V)\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\alpha_l \\) are learnable weights that balance the contribution of each hierarchical level \\( l \\).\n\n   - **Quad-Tree Hierarchy Adaptation:**\n     Incorporate a quad-tree-like structure to partition the input sequence into hierarchical blocks, enabling multi-scale processing. This can be mathematically represented as:\n     \\[\n     Y = \\text{Attention}_{\\text{global}}(\\text{Attention}_{\\text{local}}(Q, K, V))\n     \\]\n     where local attention captures fine-grained dependencies, and global attention aggregates information across blocks.\n\n2. **Adaptive State Compression:**\n   - **Dynamic Compression Rate:**\n     \\[\n     C_t = f(\\text{Complexity}(X_t)) \\cdot C_{t-1}\n     \\]\n     where \\( C_t \\) is the compressed state at time \\( t \\), and \\( f \\) is a function that adjusts the compression rate based on the complexity of the input \\( X_t \\).\n\n   - **Selective Compression:**\n     \\[\n     S_t = \\text{Select}(C_t, \\gamma)\n     \\]\n     where \\( S_t \\) selectively retains essential information from \\( C_t \\) based on a threshold \\( \\gamma \\).\n\nThese formulations ensure that the GAU can dynamically manage its state information, retaining critical data while discarding redundancies, which is essential for maintaining performance over long sequences.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\n- **Increased Complexity:** Integrating hierarchical structures and adaptive compression introduces additional computational steps, which may increase the model's overall complexity.\n- **Implementation Overhead:** The novel mechanisms require meticulous implementation to ensure seamless integration with existing GAU components.\n- **Balancing Compression and Performance:** Overly aggressive compression may lead to loss of critical information, impacting the model's ability to capture dependencies effectively.\n\nThese trade-offs are addressed through careful design choices, such as dynamic compression rates and selective retention of information, ensuring that memory efficiency improvements do not compromise model performance.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear\n```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nHierarchicalFastTTTLinearPlus enhances the FastTTTLinear GAU by integrating hierarchical multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive state compression techniques.

Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention\n\n**Architecture Integration:**\n\n- **Multi-Level Attention Blocks:**\n  - Design multiple attention layers operating at different scales, where lower levels handle fine-grained details and higher levels aggregate global information.\n  \n- **Quad-Tree Hierarchical Structure:**\n  - Partition the input sequence into hierarchical blocks, allowing each attention layer to focus on increasingly coarser representations.\n  \n**Mathematical Formulation:**\n\n\\[\nY = \\sum_{l=1}^{L} \\alpha_l \\cdot \\text{Attention}_l(Q, K, V)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the number of hierarchical levels.\n- \\( \\alpha_l \\) are learnable weights balancing the contribution of each level.\n  \nFor each hierarchical level \\( l \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}_l(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Captures varying granularities of information.\n- Reduces computational overhead by limiting full attention computations to appropriate hierarchical levels.\n\n#### 2. Adaptive State Compression\n\n**Compression Mechanism:**\n\n- **Dynamic Compression Rate Adjustment:**\n  \n\\[\nC_t = f(\\text{Complexity}(X_t)) \\cdot C_{t-1}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C_t \\) is the compressed state at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( f \\) adjusts the compression rate based on the complexity of the input \\( X_t \\).\n\n- **Selective State Retention:**\n\n\\[\nS_t = \\text{Select}(C_t, \\gamma)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S_t \\) selectively retains essential information based on a threshold \\( \\gamma \\).\n\n**Layer Implementation:**\n\n- **State Compressor Block:**\n  - Implements dynamic compression rate adjustment and selective retention.\n  \n**Mathematical Formulation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_t &= \\sigma(W_c h_t^s + b_c) \\odot \\text{tanh}(W_h h_t^s + b_h) \\\\\nS_t &= \\text{Threshold}(C_t, \\gamma)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h_t^s \\) is the slow stream state.\n- \\( W_c, W_h, b_c, b_h \\) are learnable parameters.\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function.\n- \\( \\odot \\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Retains critical state information dynamically based on input complexity.\n- Optimizes memory usage without compromising the model's ability to capture dependencies.\n\n#### 3. Memory Management and Computational Efficiency\n\n**Gradient Checkpointing:**\n\n- Implement gradient checkpointing within attention layers to reduce memory usage during training.\n\n**Hardware-Aware Optimizations:**\n\n- Optimize tensor operations to leverage parallel processing capabilities.\n- Utilize efficient memory access patterns to enhance throughput.\n\n**Mathematical Justification:**\n\nBy integrating hierarchical attention and adaptive compression, the GAU can maintain a compressed and informative state representation, reducing memory overhead and computational demands:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Memory Usage} = \\sum_{l=1}^{L} \\alpha_l \\cdot \\text{Memory}(\\text{Attention}_l) + \\text{Memory}(S_t)\n\\]\n\nThis ensures that memory consumption scales efficiently with sequence length, maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduces memory footprint during training and inference.\n- Enhances training and inference speeds by leveraging optimized computations.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for HierarchicalFastTTTLinearPlus\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass HierarchicalFastTTTLinearPlus(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, num_levels=3, gamma=0.7):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.num_levels = num_levels\n        self.gamma = gamma  #
