We propose TTT layers, a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is self-supervised learning. Our perspective that the forward pass of a layer contains a training loop itself opens up a new direction for future research. 2. TTT-Linear, one simple instantiation of TTT layers, outperforms Transformers and Mamba in our evaluations ranging from 125 M to 1.3 B parameters. 3. We improve the hardware efficiency of TTT layers through mini-batch TTT and the dual form, making TTT-Linear already a practical building block for LLMs. ## 2 Method\n\nAll sequence modeling layers can be viewed from the perspective of storing historic context into a hidden state, as shown in Figure $4 .{ }^{1}$ For example, RNN layers - such as LSTM [33], RWKV [56] and Mamba [26] layers - compress context into a state of fixed size across time.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8 k . On the other hand, once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of the extra information being conditioned on. The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention, RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,\nthe update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We introduce two simple instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention. Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already efficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical innovations to make it efficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than $5 \\times$ faster. As shown in Figure 3, TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8 k context and matches Mamba. Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following the Chinchilla recipe [34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 53/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn: The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences, and develops an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification, establishing the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the inductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence length. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an appealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient decoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show MambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits of token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of efficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference speedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding efficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/40 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1508.07909, 2015. Jimmy T.H.

Reconsidering the Past: Optimizing Hidden States in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Davis Yoshida, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hidden-State Optimization is presented, a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time that computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Hidden-State Optimization (HSO), a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time. Similar to dynamic evaluation (Krause et al., 2018), HSO computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text, but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters. We test HSO with pretrained Transformer-XL and GPT-2 language models, finding improvement on the WikiText103 and PG-19 datasets in terms of perplexity, especially when evaluating a model outside of its training distribution. We also demonstrate downstream applicability by showing gains in the recently developed prompt-based few-shot evaluation setting, again with no extra parameters or training data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. State-Reification Networks: Improving Generalization by Modeling the Distribution of Hidden Representations\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Jonathan Binas, Anirudh Goyal, Sandeep Subramanian, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Denis Kazakov, Yoshua Bengio, M. Mozer*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning promises methods that generalize well from finite labeled data. However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as \\emph{state reification}, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. Emergent Agentic Transformer from Chain of Hindsight Experience\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Hao Liu, P. Abbeel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data, and shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models powered by diverse data and model scale have dominated natural language modeling and computer vision and pushed the frontier of multiple AI areas. In reinforcement learning (RL), despite many efforts into transformer-based policies, a key limitation, however, is that current transformer-based policies cannot learn by directly combining information from multiple sub-optimal trials. In this work, we address this issue using recently proposed chain of hindsight to relabel experience, where we train a transformer on a sequence of trajectory experience ascending sorted according to their total rewards. Our method consists of relabelling target return of each trajectory to the maximum total reward among in sequence of trajectories and training an autoregressive model to predict actions conditioning on past states, actions, rewards, target returns, and task completion tokens, the resulting model, Agentic Transformer (AT), can learn to improve upon itself both at training and test time. As we show on D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks, to the best our knowledge, this is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data. Our Agentic Transformer also shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Training Heterogeneous Features in Sequence to Sequence Tasks: Latent\n  Enhanced Multi-filter Seq2Seq Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Yunhao Yang, Zhaokun Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** In language processing, training data with extremely large variance may lead\nto difficulty in the language model's convergence. It is difficult for the\nnetwork parameters to adapt sentences with largely varied semantics or\ngrammatical structures. To resolve this problem, we introduce a model that\nconcentrates the each of the heterogeneous features in the input sentences.\nBuilding upon the encoder-decoder architecture, we design a latent-enhanced\nmulti-filter seq2seq model (LEMS) that analyzes the input representations by\nintroducing a latent space transformation and clustering. The representations\nare extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent\nspace. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of\nthe representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples\nbased on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by\nthe features from their corresponding clusters, and the heterogeneity of the\ntraining data can be resolved accordingly. We conduct two sets of comparative\nexperiments on semantic parsing and machine translation, using the Geo-query\ndataset and Multi30k English-French to demonstrate the enhancement our model\nhas made respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-18T21:42:41Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-25T14:40:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Domain adaptation for sequence labeling using hidden Markov models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Edouard Grave, Guillaume Obozinski, Francis Bach*\n\n**Abstract:** Most natural language processing systems based on machine learning are not\nrobust to domain shift. For example, a state-of-the-art syntactic dependency\nparser trained on Wall Street Journal sentences has an absolute drop in\nperformance of more than ten points when tested on textual data from the Web.\nAn efficient solution to make these methods more robust to domain shift is to\nfirst learn a word representation using large amounts of unlabeled data from\nboth domains, and then use this representation as features in a supervised\nlearning algorithm. In this paper, we propose to use hidden Markov models to\nlearn word representations for part-of-speech tagging. In particular, we study\nthe influence of using data from the source, the target or both domains to\nlearn the representation and the different ways to represent words using an\nHMM.\n\n**Published:** 2013-12-14T21:48:49Z  (*Updated: 2013-12-14T21:48:49Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large\n  Language Model Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high\nmemory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference.\nWhile key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously\ncomputed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead.\nExisting KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically\ncompress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden\nstates, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our\napproach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z*)\n\n\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neural Speech Synthesis with Transformer Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" \"adaptive hidden states\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Ming Zhou, Sheng Zhao, Naihan Li, Shujie Liu, Yanqing Liu, Ming Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Although end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) methods (such as Tacotron2)\nare proposed and achieve state-of-the-art performance, they still suffer from\ntwo problems: 1) low efficiency during training and inference; 2) hard to model\nlong dependency using current recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Inspired by the\nsuccess of Transformer network in neural machine translation (NMT), in this\npaper, we introduce and adapt the multi-head attention mechanism to replace the\nRNN structures and also the original attention mechanism in Tacotron2. With the\nhelp of multi-head self-attention, the hidden states in the encoder and decoder\nare constructed in parallel, which improves the training efficiency. Meanwhile,\nany two inputs at different times are connected directly by self-attention\nmechanism, which solves the long range dependency problem effectively.

This approach has been shown to enhance the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and adapt to new data efficiently.\n  - For example, the Vision-TTT layer introduced in the arXiv paper demonstrates linear complexity and highly expressive hidden states. It treats the traditional fixed hidden state as a model that can be dynamically updated through self-supervised learning, optimizing its performance based on the current input.\n\n## Adaptive Hidden States\n\n- Enhancing the expressiveness of hidden states is crucial for capturing complex dependencies in sequential data. Techniques such as meta-learning or continual learning can be explored to enable efficient updates of hidden states.\n  - The TTT layer's dynamic update process allows the model to better capture contextual information and adjust the hidden states over time, which is a key aspect of adaptive hidden states.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- To maintain scalability, it is essential to ensure that the modifications do not introduce quadratic complexity. Approaches like mini-batch gradient descent and parallel computation can help in reducing computational complexity.\n  - The TTT layer utilizes mini-batches to compute gradients and update hidden states simultaneously, resulting in linear computational complexity. This approach significantly enhances efficiency and allows the model to handle long-range contextual information effectively.\n\n## Locality and Controllable Step Size\n\n- The design changes should be localized within the `TTT` GAU to prevent cascading modifications across other units. Implementing mechanisms that allow for incremental updates ensures that the model remains tractable and maintainable.\n  - The TTT layer's self-supervised learning mechanism and dynamic weight updates are localized and incremental, making it a suitable example for maintaining locality and controllable step size.\n\n## Key References\n\n- **Test-Time Training Layer**: The arXiv paper on Vision-TTT provides a detailed explanation of how TTT layers can be integrated into sequence modeling tasks, offering linear complexity and adaptive hidden states. This is a strong foundation for enhancing the `TTT` GAU.\n\n- **Efficient Test-Time Fine-Tuning**: The paper on efficiently learning at test-time highlights the benefits of fine-tuning models at test-time, which can significantly improve performance, especially when the prompt is not well-represented in the pre-training data. This approach aligns with the goal of adaptive hidden states and efficient updates during inference.\n\n- **Sequence Modeling Challenges**: The discussion on Hacker News about RNNs and sequence modeling highlights the challenges of handling long sequences and the need for efficient architectures. This context is useful for understanding the broader landscape of sequence modeling and the potential benefits of TTT and adaptive hidden states.\n\n## Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Keywords**:\n   - Focus on meta-learning for hidden states, efficient adaptation mechanisms during inference, and techniques for maintaining linear complexity.\n\n2. **Explore Related Architectures**:\n   - Investigate other architectures that integrate test-time training, such as those used in vision tasks or other sequence modeling domains, to gather diverse methodologies.\n\n3. **Identify Optimization Techniques**:\n   - Look into methods like gradient checkpointing, low-rank updates, or sparse training to optimize memory and computational efficiency during test-time adaptations.\n\n4. **Assess Practical Implementations**:\n   - Review existing implementations of TTT and adaptive hidden states to understand practical challenges and solutions.\n\n5. **Iterative Refinement**:\n   - Continuously refine the design proposal based on newly acquired insights, ensuring alignment with the core objectives of performance enhancement, scalability, and efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and leveraging the insights from the referenced papers, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that significantly enhances the performance, scalability, and efficiency of the existing `TTT` GAU.\n",

Laughing Hyena Distillery: Extracting Compact Recurrences From Convolutions (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli, Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Rom N. Parnichkun, Aman Timalsina, David W. Romero, Quinn McIntyre, Beidi Chen, A. Rudra, Ce Zhang, Christopher R\u00e9, Stefano Ermon, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time, and TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave further investigation of this trend to future work. The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer) since it is the stronger baseline. Figure 14 reproduces the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP and additional discussion. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-16.jpg?height=478&width=747&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=342)\n\nFigure 14. Reproduction of the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP. Comparing to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP performs slightly worse at short context but better at long context. This observation matches our expectation that the MLP as hidden state is more expressive than the linear model. Again, all methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has $2.8 \\times$ the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage as our baseline. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-17.jpg?height=408&width=1409&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=357)\n\nFigure 15. Benchmark on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G HBM and PCIe connections. Left: Same as Figure 3, but now with TTT-MLP. Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. Right: For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP. ### 3.3 Wall-clock time\n\nLLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training, except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward (during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form. Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30 s per iteration of training at context 2 k , while TTT-Linear takes 0.27 s per iteration, already $10 \\%$ faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba (implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs. Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [66]. Historically, RNNs have been inefficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmuls. Our goal with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in efficiency as forward, but requires more complex logic for manual differentiation, therefore is left for future work. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods. ${ }^{14}$ Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [72], and benchmark its speed in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size. ${ }^{15}$ For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix). All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput. [^10]\n## 4 Related Work\n\n### 4.1 Modern RNNs\n\nMamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [27, 21, 57, 18]. The hidden state in these models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba. Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [55, 56], xLSTM [5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [79] also have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [41]. Modern RNNs such as GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware efficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be processed with matmuls instead of a cumsum. However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum. In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches. Each hidden state $W_{t}$ depends on previous $W s$ within its mini-batch still through a cumsum, but depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8, mini-batch TTT enables a trade-off between expressiveness and hardware efficiency, since a smaller batch size $b$ leads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-off is a unique and important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1 , the intermediate batch size $b=16$ significantly outperforms $b=T$ which is fully cumsum. ### 4.2 Learning at Test Time\n\nThe idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors before making a prediction. This procedure has been effectively applied to models ranging from SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29]. Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [74], is to \"... get the answer that you really need, but not a more general one.\" Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add constraints to the margin of SVMs [39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple test instances to be empirically effective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time. In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such as face detection [38], object detection [53], image super-resolution [65], and 3D reconstruction [50]. More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called dynamic evaluation [44, 45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt. Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights. ### 4.2.1 Test-Time Training\n\nThe core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem, where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [69]. Concretely, for each test instance $x$, the conventional practice is to predict $f(x)$, using a predictor $f$ that is optimized for all training instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by $x$, then trains a model $f_{x}$ on $x$ (often with $f$ as initialization), and predicts $f_{x}(x)$. Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves performance especially on outliers [23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [76], as $f_{t}$ is trained on past frames $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper. Conceptually, the biggest difference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT has explored applications such as robot manipulation [28] and locomotion [68], among others, that often require different designs for the self-supervised task. ### 4.2.2 Fast Weights\n\nThe general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a \"fast\" model on only the most relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a \"slow\" model on all data [71]. This idea has existed since the 1980s [32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself, therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [35] simply adds $x x^{T}$ (or some variant thereof) [4] to the fast weights given each input $x$. In contrast, TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization. The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a \"slow\" model [62]. Our inner-loop weights $W$ can be viewed as \"fast\" and outer-loop weights $\\theta$ as \"slow\". Therefore, networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [43], similar to how TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent. The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs ${ }^{16}$. Recent work has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [37] design \"fast\" networks with weights produced as output of a \"slow\" networks. Clark et al. [16] give a Transformer a final layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN. ### 4.3 Learning to Learn\n\nFor decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [61, 6, 70, 47]. In prior work such as [2], [20] and [52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence, so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is \"one level above\" regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale. In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem. The inner loop is \"one level below\" regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is \"at the same level\" as regular training. This makes our outer loop easier to scale. [^11]|  | Inner loop | Outer loop | Subsection |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Piece of data | Token $x_{t}$ | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ |  |\n| Training set | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ | Dataset of sequences, e.g., Books | 2.2 .2 .2 |\n| Objective | Reconstruction (loss $\\ell$ ) | Next-token prediction |  |\n| Parameters | $W$ (weights of $f$ ) | $\\theta_{\\text {rest }}($ rest of the network) |  |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$ (reconstruction views) | 2.3 |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lr}}$ | 2.7 |\n\nTable 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state.

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning for sequence models\" \"adaptive inference\" \"efficient hidden state updates\"*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Learning to Learn Variational Semantic Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning for sequence models\" \"adaptive inference\" \"efficient hidden state updates\"*\n\n*Xiantong Zhen, Yingjun Du, Huan Xiong, Qiang Qiu, Cees G. M. Snoek, Ling Shao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Variational semantic memory is introduced into meta-learning to acquire long-term knowledge for few-shot learning and confers principled recall and update mechanisms that enable semantic information to be efficiently accrued and adapted for few-shot learning.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce variational semantic memory into meta-learning to acquire long-term knowledge for few-shot learning. The variational semantic memory accrues and stores semantic information for the probabilistic inference of class prototypes in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The semantic memory is grown from scratch and gradually consolidated by absorbing information from tasks it experiences. By doing so, it is able to accumulate long-term, general knowledge that enables it to learn new concepts of objects. We formulate memory recall as the variational inference of a latent memory variable from addressed contents, which offers a principled way to adapt the knowledge to individual tasks. Our variational semantic memory, as a new long-term memory module, confers principled recall and update mechanisms that enable semantic information to be efficiently accrued and adapted for few-shot learning. Experiments demonstrate that the probabilistic modelling of prototypes achieves a more informative representation of object classes compared to deterministic vectors. The consistent new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks shows the benefit of variational semantic memory in boosting few-shot recognition.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. MURAL: Meta-Learning Uncertainty-Aware Rewards for Outcome-Driven Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\"*\n\n*Kevin Li, Abhishek Gupta, Ashwin Reddy, Vitchyr H. Pong, Aurick Zhou, Justin Yu, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that an uncertainty aware classifier can solve challenging reinforcement learning problems by both encouraging exploration and provided directed guidance towards positive outcomes, and proposes a novel mechanism for obtaining these calibrated, uncertainty-aware classifiers based on an amortized technique for computing the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Exploration in reinforcement learning is a challenging problem: in the worst case, the agent must search for high-reward states that could be hidden anywhere in the state space. Can we define a more tractable class of RL problems, where the agent is provided with examples of successful outcomes? In this problem setting, the reward function can be obtained automatically by training a classifier to categorize states as successful or not. If trained properly, such a classifier can provide a well-shaped objective landscape that both promotes progress toward good states and provides a calibrated exploration bonus. In this work, we show that an uncertainty aware classifier can solve challenging reinforcement learning problems by both encouraging exploration and provided directed guidance towards positive outcomes. We propose a novel mechanism for obtaining these calibrated, uncertainty-aware classifiers based on an amortized technique for computing the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) distribution. To make this tractable, we propose a novel method for computing the NML distribution by using meta-learning. We show that the resulting algorithm has a number of intriguing connections to both count-based exploration methods and prior algorithms for learning reward functions, while also providing more effective guidance towards the goal. We demonstrate that our algorithm solves a number of challenging navigation and robotic manipulation tasks which prove difficult or impossible for prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large\n  Language Model Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning for sequence models\" \"adaptive inference\" \"efficient hidden state updates\"*\n\n*Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high\nmemory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference.\nWhile key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously\ncomputed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead.\nExisting KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically\ncompress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden\nstates, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our\napproach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning for sequence models\" \"adaptive inference\" \"efficient hidden state updates\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Restricted Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\"*\n\n*Enmao Diao, Jie Ding, Vahid Tarokh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variations such as Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), have become standard building\nblocks for learning online data of sequential nature in many research areas,\nincluding natural language processing and speech data analysis. In this paper,\nwe present a new methodology to significantly reduce the number of parameters\nin RNNs while maintaining performance that is comparable or even better than\nclassical RNNs. The new proposal, referred to as Restricted Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RRNN), restricts the weight matrices corresponding to the input data\nand hidden states at each time step to share a large proportion of parameters.\nThe new architecture can be regarded as a compression of its classical\ncounterpart, but it does not require pre-training or sophisticated parameter\nfine-tuning, both of which are major issues in most existing compression\ntechniques. Experiments on natural language modeling show that compared with\nits classical counterpart, the restricted recurrent architecture generally\nproduces comparable results at about 50\\% compression rate. In particular, the\nRestricted LSTM can outperform classical RNN with even less number of\nparameters.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-21T07:12:31Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-14T21:52:34Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of developing a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages meta-learning, adaptive inference, and efficient hidden state updates, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Meta-Learning for Hidden States\n\n- **Context-Based Meta-RL Frameworks**: These frameworks, as described in the context of meta-reinforcement learning, can be adapted for sequence models.

In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave further investigation of this trend to future work. The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer) since it is the stronger baseline. Figure 14 reproduces the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP and additional discussion. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-16.jpg?height=478&width=747&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=342)\n\nFigure 14. Reproduction of the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP. Comparing to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP performs slightly worse at short context but better at long context. This observation matches our expectation that the MLP as hidden state is more expressive than the linear model. Again, all methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has $2.8 \\times$ the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage as our baseline. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-17.jpg?height=408&width=1409&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=357)\n\nFigure 15. Benchmark on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G HBM and PCIe connections. Left: Same as Figure 3, but now with TTT-MLP. Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. Right: For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP. ### 3.3 Wall-clock time\n\nLLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training, except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward (during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form. Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30 s per iteration of training at context 2 k , while TTT-Linear takes 0.27 s per iteration, already $10 \\%$ faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba (implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs. Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [66]. Historically, RNNs have been inefficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmuls. Our goal with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in efficiency as forward, but requires more complex logic for manual differentiation, therefore is left for future work. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods. ${ }^{14}$ Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [72], and benchmark its speed in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size. ${ }^{15}$ For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix). All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput. [^10]\n## 4 Related Work\n\n### 4.1 Modern RNNs\n\nMamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [27, 21, 57, 18]. The hidden state in these models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba. Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [55, 56], xLSTM [5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [79] also have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [41]. Modern RNNs such as GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware efficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be processed with matmuls instead of a cumsum. However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum. In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches. Each hidden state $W_{t}$ depends on previous $W s$ within its mini-batch still through a cumsum, but depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8, mini-batch TTT enables a trade-off between expressiveness and hardware efficiency, since a smaller batch size $b$ leads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-off is a unique and important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1 , the intermediate batch size $b=16$ significantly outperforms $b=T$ which is fully cumsum. ### 4.2 Learning at Test Time\n\nThe idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors before making a prediction. This procedure has been effectively applied to models ranging from SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29]. Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [74], is to \"... get the answer that you really need, but not a more general one.\" Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add constraints to the margin of SVMs [39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple test instances to be empirically effective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time. In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such as face detection [38], object detection [53], image super-resolution [65], and 3D reconstruction [50]. More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called dynamic evaluation [44, 45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt. Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights. ### 4.2.1 Test-Time Training\n\nThe core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem, where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [69]. Concretely, for each test instance $x$, the conventional practice is to predict $f(x)$, using a predictor $f$ that is optimized for all training instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by $x$, then trains a model $f_{x}$ on $x$ (often with $f$ as initialization), and predicts $f_{x}(x)$. Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves performance especially on outliers [23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [76], as $f_{t}$ is trained on past frames $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper. Conceptually, the biggest difference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT has explored applications such as robot manipulation [28] and locomotion [68], among others, that often require different designs for the self-supervised task. ### 4.2.2 Fast Weights\n\nThe general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a \"fast\" model on only the most relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a \"slow\" model on all data [71]. This idea has existed since the 1980s [32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself, therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [35] simply adds $x x^{T}$ (or some variant thereof) [4] to the fast weights given each input $x$. In contrast, TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization. The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a \"slow\" model [62]. Our inner-loop weights $W$ can be viewed as \"fast\" and outer-loop weights $\\theta$ as \"slow\". Therefore, networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [43], similar to how TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent. The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs ${ }^{16}$. Recent work has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [37] design \"fast\" networks with weights produced as output of a \"slow\" networks. Clark et al. [16] give a Transformer a final layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN. ### 4.3 Learning to Learn\n\nFor decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [61, 6, 70, 47]. In prior work such as [2], [20] and [52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence, so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is \"one level above\" regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale. In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem. The inner loop is \"one level below\" regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is \"at the same level\" as regular training. This makes our outer loop easier to scale. [^11]|  | Inner loop | Outer loop | Subsection |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Piece of data | Token $x_{t}$ | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ |  |\n| Training set | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ | Dataset of sequences, e.g., Books | 2.2 .2 .2 |\n| Objective | Reconstruction (loss $\\ell$ ) | Next-token prediction |  |\n| Parameters | $W$ (weights of $f$ ) | $\\theta_{\\text {rest }}($ rest of the network) |  |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$ (reconstruction views) | 2.3 |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lr}}$ | 2.7 |\n\nTable 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state.

DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for\n  Efficient Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\" \"selective state space models\" \"state-reification networks\"*\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive\ncomputational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer\narchitecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational\nnetwork architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance\nhas yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a\nnovel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in\nSSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers,\nDenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense\nconnections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability\nand inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to\nvarious SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM\nachieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the\noriginal RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code\nis avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-26T09:21:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-05T14:31:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\" \"selective state space models\" \"state-reification networks\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample\nimplementation of Samba is publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Restricted Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\" \"variational semantic memory\" \"probabilistic hidden state models\"*\n\n*Enmao Diao, Jie Ding, Vahid Tarokh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variations such as Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), have become standard building\nblocks for learning online data of sequential nature in many research areas,\nincluding natural language processing and speech data analysis. In this paper,\nwe present a new methodology to significantly reduce the number of parameters\nin RNNs while maintaining performance that is comparable or even better than\nclassical RNNs. The new proposal, referred to as Restricted Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RRNN), restricts the weight matrices corresponding to the input data\nand hidden states at each time step to share a large proportion of parameters.\nThe new architecture can be regarded as a compression of its classical\ncounterpart, but it does not require pre-training or sophisticated parameter\nfine-tuning, both of which are major issues in most existing compression\ntechniques. Experiments on natural language modeling show that compared with\nits classical counterpart, the restricted recurrent architecture generally\nproduces comparable results at about 50\\% compression rate. In particular, the\nRestricted LSTM can outperform classical RNN with even less number of\nparameters.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-21T07:12:31Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-14T21:52:34Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Introducing the Hidden Neural Markov Chain framework\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning hidden states\" \"gated hidden state updates\" \"uncertainty-aware state compression\" \"variational semantic memory\" \"probabilistic hidden state models\"*\n\n*Elie Azeraf, Emmanuel Monfrini, Emmanuel Vignon, Wojciech Pieczynski*\n\n**Abstract:** Nowadays, neural network models achieve state-of-the-art results in many\nareas as computer vision or speech processing. For sequential data, especially\nfor Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\nand their extensions, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and the Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU), are among the most used models, having a \"term-to-term\"\nsequence processing. However, if many works create extensions and improvements\nof the RNN, few have focused on developing other ways for sequential data\nprocessing with neural networks in a \"term-to-term\" way. This paper proposes\nthe original Hidden Neural Markov Chain (HNMC) framework, a new family of\nsequential neural models. They are not based on the RNN but on the Hidden\nMarkov Model (HMM), a probabilistic graphical model. This neural extension is\npossible thanks to the recent Entropic Forward-Backward algorithm for HMM\nrestoration. We propose three different models: the classic HNMC, the HNMC2,\nand the HNMC-CN. After describing our models' whole construction, we compare\nthem with classic RNN and Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) models for some sequence\nlabeling tasks: Chunking, Part-Of-Speech Tagging, and Named Entity Recognition.\nFor every experiment, whatever the architecture or the embedding method used,\none of our proposed models has the best results. It shows this new neural\nsequential framework's potential, which can open the way to new models, and\nmight eventually compete with the prevalent BiLSTM and BiGRU.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-17T20:13:45Z  (*Updated: 2021-02-17T20:13:45Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, several key areas and techniques need to be explored in depth. Here are the most relevant insights and references that align with the researcher's intent:\n\n### Meta-Learning for Dynamic Hidden State Adaptation\n\n- **Meta-Learning Frameworks**: Integrating meta-learning can enable the model to dynamically adapt its hidden states during inference. The concept of meta-learning intrinsic rewards, as seen in the work on black box meta-learning, can be adapted to optimize the hidden state updates. For instance, the approach in uses meta-learning to optimize the reward function, which can be analogously applied to optimize the hidden state updates in the LM block.\n\n### Gated Mechanisms for Enhanced Expressiveness\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers**: The use of GLA Transformers, as described in, can maintain linear computational complexity while enhancing the expressiveness of the model. This is crucial for the `TTT` GAU, as it needs to balance efficiency and performance. The data-dependent gates in GLA can be integrated into the LM block to improve its ability to handle complex sequences.\n\n### Uncertainty-Aware Compression for Efficient Hidden States\n\n- **UNComp**: The uncertainty-aware compression scheme described in the analysis note is highly relevant. This approach, similar to the one in, allows for the adaptive compression of hidden states based on the model's uncertainty, which can significantly reduce computational overhead without substantial performance loss.\n\n### Selective State Space Models\n\n- **Mamba and MambaByte**: These models, as mentioned in the analysis note, demonstrate the effectiveness of selective state spaces in achieving a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Integrating such selective mechanisms into the `TTT` GAU can ensure optimal allocation of computational resources to more informative parts of the sequence.\n\n### Probabilistic Hidden State Representations\n\n- **Variational Semantic Memory**: Employing probabilistic modeling for hidden states, as in, ensures that updates remain within a robust and performant manifold, enhancing generalization capabilities. This approach can be integrated to model the distribution of hidden states in the LM block.\n\n### Hierarchical and Multi-Filter Approaches\n\n- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: The integration of meta-learning into hierarchical reinforcement learning, as seen in, can provide insights into how to handle complex tasks by decomposing them into structured policies. This hierarchical approach can be adapted to handle multi-scale dependencies in sequences within the LM block.\n\n### Key References and Insights\n\n1. **Meta-Learning Intrinsic Rewards**:\n   - The work on black box meta-learning provides a framework for optimizing components of the learning algorithm, which can be applied to optimize hidden state updates in the LM block.\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**:\n   - The paper on GLA Transformers offers a method to maintain linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness, which is crucial for the `TTT` GAU.\n\n3. **Uncertainty-Aware Compression**:\n   - The concept of UNComp is essential for adaptively compressing hidden states based on model uncertainty, ensuring efficiency without performance loss.\n\n4. **Selective State Space Models**:\n   - The Mamba and MambaByte models highlight the importance of selective state spaces in balancing efficiency and expressiveness, as discussed in the analysis note.\n\n5. **Probabilistic Hidden State Representations**:\n   - The use of variational semantic memory ensures robust generalization by modeling the distribution of hidden states.\n\n6. **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**:\n   - The integration of meta-learning into hierarchical reinforcement learning provides a structured approach to handling complex tasks, which can be adapted for the LM block.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Advanced Meta-Learning Frameworks**: Investigate recent meta-learning techniques that enable dynamic hidden state updates during inference, such as those used in reinforcement learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning.\n- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Deep dive into probabilistic modeling for hidden states to ensure robust generalization and adaptability.\n- **Hierarchical State Processing**: Examine literature on hierarchical state processing and multi-filter mechanisms to capture multi-scale dependencies in sequences.\n- **Optimization Strategies**: Research advanced optimization techniques such as gradient checkpointing, low-rank approximations, and sparse training to optimize hidden state updates without increasing computational overhead.\n- **Comparative Analysis**: Conduct a comparative analysis with existing models like Mamba, GLA Transformers, and Agentic Transformers to benchmark performance improvements and efficiency gains.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and integrating the insights from the referenced works, the researcher can develop a novel LM block that enhances test-time training, adaptability, and efficiency while maintaining or improving performance.\n",

Laughing Hyena Distillery: Extracting Compact Recurrences From Convolutions (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli, Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Rom N. Parnichkun, Aman Timalsina, David W. Romero, Quinn McIntyre, Beidi Chen, A. Rudra, Ce Zhang, Christopher R\u00e9, Stefano Ermon, Y.

In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave further investigation of this trend to future work. The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer) since it is the stronger baseline. Figure 14 reproduces the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP and additional discussion. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-16.jpg?height=478&width=747&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=342)\n\nFigure 14. Reproduction of the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP. Comparing to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP performs slightly worse at short context but better at long context. This observation matches our expectation that the MLP as hidden state is more expressive than the linear model. Again, all methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has $2.8 \\times$ the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage as our baseline. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-17.jpg?height=408&width=1409&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=357)\n\nFigure 15. Benchmark on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G HBM and PCIe connections. Left: Same as Figure 3, but now with TTT-MLP. Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. Right: For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP. ### 3.3 Wall-clock time\n\nLLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training, except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward (during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form. Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30 s per iteration of training at context 2 k , while TTT-Linear takes 0.27 s per iteration, already $10 \\%$ faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba (implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs. Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [66]. Historically, RNNs have been inefficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmuls. Our goal with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in efficiency as forward, but requires more complex logic for manual differentiation, therefore is left for future work. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods. ${ }^{14}$ Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [72], and benchmark its speed in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size. ${ }^{15}$ For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix). All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput. [^10]\n## 4 Related Work\n\n### 4.1 Modern RNNs\n\nMamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [27, 21, 57, 18]. The hidden state in these models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba. Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [55, 56], xLSTM [5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [79] also have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [41]. Modern RNNs such as GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware efficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be processed with matmuls instead of a cumsum. However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum. In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches. Each hidden state $W_{t}$ depends on previous $W s$ within its mini-batch still through a cumsum, but depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8, mini-batch TTT enables a trade-off between expressiveness and hardware efficiency, since a smaller batch size $b$ leads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-off is a unique and important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1 , the intermediate batch size $b=16$ significantly outperforms $b=T$ which is fully cumsum. ### 4.2 Learning at Test Time\n\nThe idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors before making a prediction. This procedure has been effectively applied to models ranging from SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29]. Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [74], is to \"... get the answer that you really need, but not a more general one.\" Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add constraints to the margin of SVMs [39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple test instances to be empirically effective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time. In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such as face detection [38], object detection [53], image super-resolution [65], and 3D reconstruction [50]. More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called dynamic evaluation [44, 45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt. Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights. ### 4.2.1 Test-Time Training\n\nThe core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem, where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [69]. Concretely, for each test instance $x$, the conventional practice is to predict $f(x)$, using a predictor $f$ that is optimized for all training instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by $x$, then trains a model $f_{x}$ on $x$ (often with $f$ as initialization), and predicts $f_{x}(x)$. Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves performance especially on outliers [23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [76], as $f_{t}$ is trained on past frames $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper. Conceptually, the biggest difference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT has explored applications such as robot manipulation [28] and locomotion [68], among others, that often require different designs for the self-supervised task. ### 4.2.2 Fast Weights\n\nThe general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a \"fast\" model on only the most relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a \"slow\" model on all data [71]. This idea has existed since the 1980s [32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself, therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [35] simply adds $x x^{T}$ (or some variant thereof) [4] to the fast weights given each input $x$. In contrast, TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization. The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a \"slow\" model [62]. Our inner-loop weights $W$ can be viewed as \"fast\" and outer-loop weights $\\theta$ as \"slow\". Therefore, networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [43], similar to how TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent. The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs ${ }^{16}$. Recent work has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [37] design \"fast\" networks with weights produced as output of a \"slow\" networks. Clark et al. [16] give a Transformer a final layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN. ### 4.3 Learning to Learn\n\nFor decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [61, 6, 70, 47]. In prior work such as [2], [20] and [52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence, so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is \"one level above\" regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale. In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem. The inner loop is \"one level below\" regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is \"at the same level\" as regular training. This makes our outer loop easier to scale. [^11]|  | Inner loop | Outer loop | Subsection |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Piece of data | Token $x_{t}$ | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ |  |\n| Training set | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ | Dataset of sequences, e.g., Books | 2.2 .2 .2 |\n| Objective | Reconstruction (loss $\\ell$ ) | Next-token prediction |  |\n| Parameters | $W$ (weights of $f$ ) | $\\theta_{\\text {rest }}($ rest of the network) |  |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$ (reconstruction views) | 2.3 |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lr}}$ | 2.7 |\n\nTable 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state.

For example, the use of meta-learning in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) as described in, allows the agent to adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal data, which can be a valuable approach for TTT GAU.\n  - \"Our approach employs meta-learning for rapid task adaptation based on prior experience, while intrinsic motivation mechanisms encourage efficient exploration by rewarding novel state visits.\"\n  - This concept can be adapted to enable the TTT GAU to dynamically update its hidden states based on meta-learned parameters.\n\n### Gated Mechanisms for Enhanced Expressiveness\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers**: Incorporating gated mechanisms, such as those in GLA Transformers, can enhance the model's expressiveness without increasing computational complexity. This is crucial for maintaining linear complexity while handling complex sequences.\n  - \"Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers integrate data-dependent gates to maintain linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness, achieving competitive performance with traditional Transformers and recent linear-time models like Mamba\".\n\n### Uncertainty-Aware Compression\n\n- **UNComp**: Implementing uncertainty-aware compression schemes can significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance. This is particularly relevant for long-context tasks.\n  - \"UNComp introduces an uncertainty-aware compression scheme for large language models, adaptively compressing hidden states and KV caches based on model uncertainty, achieving significant speedups and memory reductions with minimal performance loss\"[Analysis Note].\n\n### Selective State Space Models\n\n- **Mamba and MambaByte**: These models demonstrate the effectiveness of selective state spaces in balancing computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n  - \"Mamba layers compress context into state of fixed size across time.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/21 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.10997, 2023.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"memory augmented language models\", \"gradient based adaptation\", \"hidden state compression\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

For dense models, increasing their size proportionally increases their computational footprint. In this work, we seek to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary based routing functions. Our proposed approach, dubbed Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE), can be seen as a memory augmented model, where a large set of word-specific experts play the role of a sparse memory. We demonstrate that MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks. Moreover, MoWE outperforms traditional MoE models on knowledge intensive tasks and has similar performance to complex memory augmented approaches that often require to invoke custom mechanisms to search the sparse memory.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

To parse open-domain natural language and adapt to a user's idiosyncratic procedures, not known during prompt engineering time, fixed prompts fall short. In this paper, we introduce HELPER, an embodied agent equipped with an external memory of language-program pairs that parses free-form human-robot dialogue into action programs through retrieval-augmented LLM prompting: relevant memories are retrieved based on the current dialogue, instruction, correction, or VLM description, and used as in-context prompt examples for LLM querying. The memory is expanded during deployment to include pairs of user's language and action plans, to assist future inferences and personalize them to the user's language and routines. HELPER sets a new state-of-the-art in the TEACh benchmark in both Execution from Dialog History (EDH) and Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD), with a 1.7x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for TfD.

Two Examples are Better than One: Context Regularization for Gradient-based Prompt Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"gradient based adaptation\"*\n\n*Hyeonmin Ha, Soyoung Jung, Jin-Woo Park, Minjoon Seo, Seung-won Hwang, Byung-Gon Chun*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel regularization method, CoRe, is proposed for gradient-based prompt tuning techniques, which guides a prompt to produce a task context properly and reg-ularizing the context extends to improving zero-shot in-context learning performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompting has gained tremendous attention as an efficient method for the adaptation of large-scale language models. However, prompts often act against human intuition and report unstable performances, which has motivated meth-ods that automatically find effective prompts. One popular approach is gradient-based search, which iteratively updates a (randomly) initialized prompt towards the optimal one with the guide of gradients. We propose a novel regularization method, CoRe, for gradient-based prompt tuning techniques, which guides a prompt to produce a task context properly. CoRe realizes two regularization effects \u2014 context attuning and context filtering \u2014 that improve prediction performance in a zero-shot in-context learning setting where a model makes inferences only with the prompt tuned by CoRe, without any demonstration examples for in-context learning. Context attuning guides the context generated by the input and the tuned prompt toward embedding the appropriate context for the task. In our theoretical analysis, reg-ularizing the context extends to improving zero-shot in-context learning performance. Context filtering steers the prompt to select only the task-related context so that context attuning solely focuses on creating and sending the right task context. We evaluate CoRe on natural language understanding datasets and two large language models, GPT2-XL and GPT-J. Our training scheme shows performance improvements up to 11.9% on GPT2-XL, and up to 6.3% on GPT-J\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

In those settings, the meta model is usually overparameterized. While the conventional statistical learning theory suggests that overparameterized models tend to overfit, empirical evidence reveals that overparameterized meta learning methods still work well -- a phenomenon often called\"benign overfitting.\"To understand this phenomenon, we focus on the meta learning settings with a challenging bilevel structure that we term the gradient-based meta learning, and analyze its generalization performance under an overparameterized meta linear regression model. While our analysis uses the relatively tractable linear models, our theory contributes to understanding the delicate interplay among data heterogeneity, model adaptation and benign overfitting in gradient-based meta learning tasks. We corroborate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Charformer: Fast Character Transformers via Gradient-based Subword Tokenization\n\n*From Search Query: \"gradient based adaptation\"*\n\n*Yi Tay, Vinh Q. Tran, Sebastian Ruder, Jai Gupta, Hyung Won Chung, Dara Bahri, Zhen Qin, Simon Baumgartner, Cong Yu, Donald Metzler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST) that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a data-driven fashion is introduced that paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained completely end-to-end.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST) that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network. We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE, multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained completely end-to-end.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 136  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 7. Adaptive Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for BERT Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"hidden state compression\"*\n\n*Jinyang Guo, Jiaheng Liu, Z. Wang, Yuqing Ma, Ruihao Gong, Ke Xu, Xianglong Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel contrastive distillation loss based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features and incorporates this strategy into a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation approach called adaptive contrastive knowledge distillation (ACKD) for BERT compression. Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Marginal Utility Diminishes: Exploring the Minimum Knowledge for BERT Knowledge Distillation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hidden state compression\"*\n\n*Yuanxin Liu, Fandong Meng, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the student\u2019s performance can be improved by extracting and distilling the crucial HSK, and using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the same performance as extensive HSK distillation, and an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great success in BERT compression. Instead of only learning from the teacher\u2019s soft label as in conventional KD, researchers find that the rich information contained in the hidden layers of BERT is conducive to the student\u2019s performance. To better exploit the hidden knowledge, a common practice is to force the student to deeply mimic the teacher\u2019s hidden states of all the tokens in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, however, we observe that although distilling the teacher\u2019s hidden state knowledge (HSK) is helpful, the performance gain (marginal utility) diminishes quickly as more HSK is distilled. To understand this effect, we conduct a series of analysis. Specifically, we divide the HSK of BERT into three dimensions, namely depth, length and width. We first investigate a variety of strategies to extract crucial knowledge for each single dimension and then jointly compress the three dimensions. In this way, we show that 1) the student\u2019s performance can be improved by extracting and distilling the crucial HSK, and 2) using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the same performance as extensive HSK distillation. Based on the second finding, we further propose an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT, which does not require loading the teacher during the training of student. For two kinds of student models and computing devices, the proposed KD paradigm gives rise to training speedup of 2.7x 3.4x.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9.

This task typically involves the learning of short range dependencies, which generally model the syntactic properties of a language and/or long range dependencies, which are semantic in nature. We propose in this paper a new multi-span architecture, which separately models the short and long context information while it dynamically merges them to perform the language modeling task. This is done through a novel recurrent Long-Short Range Context (LSRC) network, which explicitly models the local (short) and global (long) context using two separate hidden states that evolve in time. This new architecture is an adaptation of the Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to take into account the linguistic properties.

Training Language Models with Memory Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory augmented language models\"*\n\n*Zexuan Zhong, Tao Lei, Danqi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has improved language models (LMs) remarkably by equipping them\nwith a non-parametric memory component. However, most existing approaches only\nintroduce mem-ories at testing time or represent them using a separately\ntrained encoder, resulting in suboptimal training of the language model. In\nthis work, we present TRIME, a novel yet simple training approach designed for\ntraining LMs with memory augmentation.

We also present new\nmethods for memory construction and data batching, which are used for adapting\nto different sets of memories--local, long-term, and external memory--at\ntesting time. We evaluate TRIME on multiple language modeling and machine\ntranslation benchmarks and show that it is able to achieve significant\nimprovements across all the settings. Concretely, TRIME reduces the perplexity\nfrom 18.70 to 15.37 on WIKITEXT-103, by effectively leveraging a large memory\nset from the training corpus.

Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss.

To achieve better distillation efficacy, we propose Contrastive\nDistillation on Intermediate Representations (CoDIR), a principled knowledge\ndistillation framework where the student is trained to distill knowledge\nthrough intermediate layers of the teacher via a contrastive objective. By\nlearning to distinguish positive sample from a large set of negative samples,\nCoDIR facilitates the student's exploitation of rich information in teacher's\nhidden layers.

JARVIS-1: Open-World Multi-task Agents with Memory-Augmented Multimodal Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory augmented language models\"*\n\n*Yitao Liang, Xiaojian Ma, Yaodong Yang, Zilong Zheng, Zhaofeng He, Haowei Lin, Bowei Zhang, Jinbing Hou, Yonggang Jin, Anji Liu, Shaofei Cai, ZiHao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Achieving human-like planning and control with multimodal observations in an open world is a key milestone for more functional generalist agents. Existing approaches can handle certain long-horizon tasks in an open world. However, they still struggle when the number of open-world tasks could potentially be infinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as game time progresses. We introduce JARVIS-1, an open-world agent that can perceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions), generate sophisticated plans, and perform embodied control, all within the popular yet challenging open-world Minecraft universe. Specifically, we develop JARVIS-1 on top of pre-trained multimodal language models, which map visual observations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately dispatched to the goal-conditioned controllers. We outfit JARVIS-1 with a multimodal memory, which facilitates planning using both pre-trained knowledge and its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS-1 is the existing most general agent in Minecraft, capable of completing over 200 different tasks using control and observation space similar to humans. These tasks range from short-horizon tasks, e.g., \"chopping trees\" to long-horizon tasks, e.g., \"obtaining a diamond pickaxe\". JARVIS-1 performs exceptionally well in short-horizon tasks, achieving nearly perfect performance. In the classic long-term task of $\\texttt{ObtainDiamondPickaxe}$, JARVIS-1 surpasses the reliability of current state-of-the-art agents by 5 times and can successfully complete longer-horizon and more challenging tasks.

SCL: Towards Accurate Domain Adaptive Object Detection via Gradient Detach Based Stacked Complementary Losses\n\n*From Search Query: \"gradient based adaptation\"*\n\n*Harsh Maheshwari, Zhiqiang Shen, Weichen Yao, Marios Savvides*\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection aims to learn a robust detector in the domain shift circumstance, where the training (source) domain is label-rich with bounding box annotations, while the testing (target) domain is label-agnostic and the feature distributions between training and testing domains are dissimilar or even totally different. In this paper, we propose a gradient detach based stacked complementary losses (SCL) method that uses detection losses as the primary objective, and cuts in several auxiliary losses in different network stages accompanying with gradient detach training to learn more discriminative representations. We argue that the prior methods mainly leverage more loss functions for training but ignore the interaction of different losses and also the compatible training strategy (gradient detach updating in our work). Thus, our proposed method is a more syncretic adaptation learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on seven datasets, the results demonstrate that our method performs favorably better than the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Eve: A Gradient Based Optimization Method with Locally and Globally Adaptive Learning Rates\n\n*From Search Query: \"gradient based adaptation\"*\n\n*Jayanth Koushik, Hiroaki Hayashi, Graham Neubig*\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods for stochastic optimization adjust the learning\nrate for each parameter locally. However, there is also a global learning rate\nwhich must be tuned in order to get the best performance. In this paper, we\npresent a new algorithm that adapts the learning rate locally for each\nparameter separately, and also globally for all parameters together.\nSpecifically, we modify Adam, a popular method for training deep learning\nmodels, with a coefficient that captures properties of the objective function.\nEmpirically, we show that our method, which we call Eve, outperforms Adam and\nother popular methods in training deep neural networks, like convolutional\nneural networks for image classification, and recurrent neural networks for\nlanguage tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2016-11-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hidden state compression\"*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Guokun Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension. The code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/laiguokun/Funnel-Transformer.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images\n\n*From Search Query: \"hidden state compression\"*\n\n*Matthias Nie\u00dfner, Andreas R\u00f6ssler, Luisa Verdoliva, Justus Thies, Davide Cozzolino, Christian Riess*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid progress in synthetic image generation and manipulation has now come to a point where it raises significant concerns for the implications towards society. At best, this leads to a loss of trust in digital content, but could potentially cause further harm by spreading false information or fake news. This paper examines the realism of state-of-the-art image manipulations, and how difficult it is to detect them, either automatically or by humans. To standardize the evaluation of detection methods, we propose an automated benchmark for facial manipulation detection. In particular, the benchmark is based on DeepFakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures as prominent representatives for facial manipulations at random compression level and size. The benchmark is publicly available and contains a hidden test set as well as a database of over 1.8 million manipulated images. This dataset is over an order of magnitude larger than comparable, publicly available, forgery datasets. Based on this data, we performed a thorough analysis of data-driven forgery detectors. We show that the use of additional domainspecific knowledge improves forgery detection to unprecedented accuracy, even in the presence of strong compression, and clearly outperforms human observers.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory-augmented architectures, efficient storage and retrieval of information, gradient-based adaptation techniques, and methods for compressing hidden states, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Memory-Augmented Architectures\n\n- **MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling**:\n  This approach introduces an external retriever for historical information retrieval, combining a non-differentiable \"ret-mem\" module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model. It uses a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism to leverage semantic-level relevant chunks, significantly improving performance on long-context language modeling tasks and reducing memory consumption.\n\n- **LangGraph Agent with Long-term Memory**:\n  This method involves integrating long-term memory into AI systems using stateful or \"memory-augmented\" models. These models store and recall information over time, enabling more context-aware interactions. The use of nodes for memory storage, retrieval, and conversational processing helps in balancing performance with data retention.\n\n## Gradient-Based Adaptation Techniques\n\n- **Memory of Amortized Contexts (MAC)**:\n  This approach uses amortized feature extraction and memory-augmentation to compress and extract information. It employs amortization-based meta-learning, which substitutes the optimization process with a single forward pass, making it efficient for online adaptation[Analysis Note, Tack et al., 2024].\n\n- **Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models**:\n  CaMeLS (Context-Aware Meta-Learning for Online Adaptation) demonstrates success in context-aware meta-learning, which can be integrated with gradient-based adaptation techniques to improve the model's ability to adapt to new contexts efficiently[Analysis Note, Finn et al., 2023].\n\n## Efficient Compression Methods for Hidden States\n\n- **Hidden State Compression in MemLong**:\n  MemLong stores past contexts and knowledge in a non-trainable memory bank and retrieves chunk-level key-value pairs. This approach ensures distributional consistency and training efficiency while extending the context window significantly, which implies effective compression of hidden states.\n\n- **Task-oriented Memory-efficient Pruning-Adapter**:\n  This method achieves efficiency in both training and inference by using task-oriented pruning and adapter techniques. It reduces the memory footprint while maintaining performance, which is crucial for handling long sequences[Analysis Note, Wang et al., 2023].\n\n## Combining Multiple Efficiency Strategies\n\n- **LAMPS (Efficient Inference for Augmented Large Language Models)**:\n  LAMPS is a novel inference framework that minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach. It ranks requests based on their memory consumption over time, predicts the strategy to minimize memory waste, and implements starvation prevention techniques. This framework can be integrated with memory-augmented models to optimize both memory usage and inference efficiency.\n\n- **ReMEmbR (Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Embodied Robots)**:\n  ReMEmbR combines LLMs, VLMs, and retrieval-augmented generation to build scalable long-horizon memory and reasoning systems. It uses vector databases to efficiently build semantic memory and an LLM agent to reason over this memory, demonstrating how multiple efficiency strategies can be combined for robust performance.\n\nBy integrating these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in storage and retrieval, adaptable through gradient-based techniques, and capable of compressing hidden states without compromising performance.\n",

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time, and TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/51 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nThis trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave further investigation of this trend to future work. The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer) since it is the stronger baseline. Figure 14 reproduces the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP and additional discussion. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-16.jpg?height=478&width=747&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=342)\n\nFigure 14. Reproduction of the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP. Comparing to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP performs slightly worse at short context but better at long context. This observation matches our expectation that the MLP as hidden state is more expressive than the linear model. Again, all methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has $2.8 \\times$ the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage as our baseline. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-17.jpg?height=408&width=1409&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=357)\n\nFigure 15. Benchmark on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G HBM and PCIe connections. Left: Same as Figure 3, but now with TTT-MLP. Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. Right: For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP. ### 3.3 Wall-clock time\n\nLLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training, except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward (during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form. Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30 s per iteration of training at context 2 k , while TTT-Linear takes 0.27 s per iteration, already $10 \\%$ faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba (implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs. Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [66]. Historically, RNNs have been inefficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmuls. Our goal with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in efficiency as forward, but requires more complex logic for manual differentiation, therefore is left for future work. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods. ${ }^{14}$ Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [72], and benchmark its speed in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size. ${ }^{15}$ For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix). All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput. [^10]\n## 4 Related Work\n\n### 4.1 Modern RNNs\n\nMamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [27, 21, 57, 18]. The hidden state in these models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba. Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [55, 56], xLSTM [5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [79] also have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [41]. Modern RNNs such as GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware efficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be processed with matmuls instead of a cumsum. However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum. In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches. Each hidden state $W_{t}$ depends on previous $W s$ within its mini-batch still through a cumsum, but depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8, mini-batch TTT enables a trade-off between expressiveness and hardware efficiency, since a smaller batch size $b$ leads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-off is a unique and important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1 , the intermediate batch size $b=16$ significantly outperforms $b=T$ which is fully cumsum. ### 4.2 Learning at Test Time\n\nThe idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors before making a prediction. This procedure has been effectively applied to models ranging from SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29]. Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [74], is to \"... get the answer that you really need, but not a more general one.\" Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add constraints to the margin of SVMs [39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple test instances to be empirically effective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time. In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such as face detection [38], object detection [53], image super-resolution [65], and 3D reconstruction [50]. More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called dynamic evaluation [44, 45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt. Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights. ### 4.2.1 Test-Time Training\n\nThe core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem, where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [69]. Concretely, for each test instance $x$, the conventional practice is to predict $f(x)$, using a predictor $f$ that is optimized for all training instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by $x$, then trains a model $f_{x}$ on $x$ (often with $f$ as initialization), and predicts $f_{x}(x)$. Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves performance especially on outliers [23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [76], as $f_{t}$ is trained on past frames $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper. Conceptually, the biggest difference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT has explored applications such as robot manipulation [28] and locomotion [68], among others, that often require different designs for the self-supervised task. ### 4.2.2 Fast Weights\n\nThe general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a \"fast\" model on only the most relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a \"slow\" model on all data [71]. This idea has existed since the 1980s [32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself, therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [35] simply adds $x x^{T}$ (or some variant thereof) [4] to the fast weights given each input $x$. In contrast, TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization. The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a \"slow\" model [62]. Our inner-loop weights $W$ can be viewed as \"fast\" and outer-loop weights $\\theta$ as \"slow\". Therefore, networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [43], similar to how TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent. The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs ${ }^{16}$. Recent work has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [37] design \"fast\" networks with weights produced as output of a \"slow\" networks. Clark et al. [16] give a Transformer a final layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN. ### 4.3 Learning to Learn\n\nFor decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [61, 6, 70, 47]. In prior work such as [2], [20] and [52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence, so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is \"one level above\" regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale. In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem. The inner loop is \"one level below\" regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is \"at the same level\" as regular training. This makes our outer loop easier to scale. [^11]|  | Inner loop | Outer loop | Subsection |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Piece of data | Token $x_{t}$ | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ |  |\n| Training set | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ | Dataset of sequences, e.g., Books | 2.2 .2 .2 |\n| Objective | Reconstruction (loss $\\ell$ ) | Next-token prediction |  |\n| Parameters | $W$ (weights of $f$ ) | $\\theta_{\\text {rest }}($ rest of the network) |  |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$ (reconstruction views) | 2.3 |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lr}}$ | 2.7 |\n\nTable 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Meta Learning to Bridge Vision and Language Models for Multimodal Few-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Ivona Najdenkoska, Xiantong Zhen, M. Worring*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experimental results show that the multimodal meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal few-shot learning is challenging due to the large domain gap between vision and language modalities. Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Nathan J. Hu, E. Mitchell, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Massive Editing for Large Language Models via Meta Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Chenmien Tan, Ge Zhang, Jie Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN) is proposed, which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation and is capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the identical hyper-network architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have enabled learning knowledge from the pre-training corpora, the acquired knowledge may be fundamentally incorrect or outdated over time, which necessitates rectifying the knowledge of the language model (LM) after the training. A promising approach involves employing a hyper-network to generate parameter shift, whereas existing hyper-networks suffer from inferior scalability in synchronous editing operation amount. To mitigate the problem, we propose the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN), which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation. To accommodate editing multiple facts simultaneously with limited memory budgets, we separate the computation on the hyper-network and LM, enabling arbitrary batch size on both neural networks. Our method is evaluated by editing up to thousands of facts on LMs with different architectures, i.e., BERT-base, GPT-2, T5-XL (2.8B), and GPT-J (6B), across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, i.e., closed book fact-checking and question answering. Remarkably, MALMEN is capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the identical hyper-network architecture and outperforms editor specifically designed for GPT.

It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 1727  (*Influential: 266*)\n\n#### 5. Variable-Bitrate Neural Compression via Bayesian Arithmetic Coding\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty compression neural\"*\n\n*Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, S. Mandt*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the \"plug and play\" nature of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with a single trained model, eliminating the need to train multiple models for different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty compression neural\"*\n\n*Ryan Benkert, M. Prabhushankar, Ghassan AlRegib*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions (TULIP) as a simple approach to address the shortcomings of current single-pass estimators and implements feature preservation by extracting features from intermediate representations before information is collapsed by subsequent layers.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we discuss feature engineering for single-pass uncertainty estimation. For accurate uncertainty estimates, neural networks must extract differences in the feature space that quantify uncertainty. This could be achieved by current single-pass approaches that maintain feature distances between data points as they traverse the network. While initial results are promising, maintaining feature distances within the network representations frequently inhibits information compression and opposes the learning objective. We study this effect theoretically and empirically to arrive at a simple conclusion: preserving feature distances in the output is beneficial when the preserved features contribute to learning the label distribution and act in opposition otherwise. We then propose Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions (TULIP) as a simple approach to address the shortcomings of current single-pass estimators. Specifically, we implement feature preservation by extracting features from intermediate representations before information is collapsed by subsequent layers. We refer to the underlying preservation mechanism as transitional feature preservation. We show that TULIP matches or outperforms current single-pass methods on standard benchmarks and in practical settings where these methods are less reliable (imbalances, complex architectures, medical modalities).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Adaptive Gating in Mixture-of-Experts based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Jiamin Li, Qiang Su, Yitao Yang, Yimin Jiang, Cong Wang, Hong-Yu Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive gating in MoE is introduced, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution that preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have demonstrated exceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for scaling models while maintaining a constant number of computational operations. Existing MoE model adopts a fixed gating network where each token is computed by the same number of experts. However, this approach contradicts our intuition that the tokens in each sequence vary in terms of their linguistic complexity and, consequently, require different computational costs. Little is discussed in prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model performance. This paper introduces adaptive gating in MoE, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution. The proposed framework preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency. Additionally, curriculum learning is leveraged to further reduce training time. Extensive experiments on diverse NLP tasks show that adaptive gating reduces at most 22.5% training time while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the routing decisions and present our insights when adaptive gating is used.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Sangwon Yu, Jongyoon Song, Heeseung Kim, SeongEun Lee, Woo-Jong Ryu, Sung-Hoon Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study analyzes the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding and proposes a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating (AGG), which addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare tokenembeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have determined that the learned token embeddings of large-scale neural language models are degenerated to be anisotropic with a narrow-cone shape. This phenomenon, called the representation degeneration problem, facilitates an increase in the overall similarity between token embeddings that negatively affect the performance of the models. Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored. In this study, we analyze the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding. We demonstrate that the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings is the key cause of the degeneration problem for all tokens during training stage. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating(AGG). AGG addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings. Experimental results from language modeling, word similarity, and machine translation tasks quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of AGG.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y.

We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Meta-Learning for Low-resource Natural Language Generation in\n  Task-oriented Dialogue Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Fei Mi, Minlie Huang, Jiyong Zhang, Boi Faltings*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural language generation (NLG) is an essential component of task-oriented\ndialogue systems. Despite the recent success of neural approaches for NLG, they\nare typically developed for particular domains with rich annotated training\nexamples. In this paper, we study NLG in a low-resource setting to generate\nsentences in new scenarios with handful training examples. We formulate the\nproblem from a meta-learning perspective, and propose a generalized\noptimization-based approach (Meta-NLG) based on the well-recognized\nmodel-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm. Meta-NLG defines a set of meta\ntasks, and directly incorporates the objective of adapting to new low-resource\nNLG tasks into the meta-learning optimization process. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on a large multi-domain dataset (MultiWoz) with diverse\nlinguistic variations. We show that Meta-NLG significantly outperforms other\ntraining procedures in various low-resource configurations. We analyze the\nresults, and demonstrate that Meta-NLG adapts extremely fast and well to\nlow-resource situations.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-14T14:35:06Z  (*Updated: 2019-05-14T14:35:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Natural Language\n  Classification Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Trapit Bansal, Rishikesh Jha, Tsendsuren Munkhdalai, Andrew McCallum*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-supervised pre-training of transformer models has revolutionized NLP\napplications. Such pre-training with language modeling objectives provides a\nuseful initial point for parameters that generalize well to new tasks with\nfine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is still data inefficient -- when there are\nfew labeled examples, accuracy can be low. Data efficiency can be improved by\noptimizing pre-training directly for future fine-tuning with few examples; this\ncan be treated as a meta-learning problem. However, standard meta-learning\ntechniques require many training tasks in order to generalize; unfortunately,\nfinding a diverse set of such supervised tasks is usually difficult. This paper\nproposes a self-supervised approach to generate a large, rich, meta-learning\ntask distribution from unlabeled text. This is achieved using a cloze-style\nobjective, but creating separate multi-class classification tasks by gathering\ntokens-to-be blanked from among only a handful of vocabulary terms. This yields\nas many unique meta-training tasks as the number of subsets of vocabulary\nterms. We meta-train a transformer model on this distribution of tasks using a\nrecent meta-learning framework. On 17 NLP tasks, we show that this\nmeta-training leads to better few-shot generalization than language-model\npre-training followed by finetuning. Furthermore, we show how the\nself-supervised tasks can be combined with supervised tasks for meta-learning,\nproviding substantial accuracy gains over previous supervised meta-learning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-17T17:53:59Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-15T20:31:22Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty compression neural\"*\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs)\nover highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by\na small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of\ncompression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally\ncompressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving\nefficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to\nthis goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are\nnot well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively\ncompressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome\nthis, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text\nis segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this\nmethod, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that\nimproves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on\nperplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse\nperplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter\ncount, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths\nrequire fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we\nprovide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability,\nand offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\nhigh-compression tokenizers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-04T17:48:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-13T22:01:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid\nrecomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-15T05:01:19Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-19T08:45:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

After years of development,\nresearchers have improved the internal structure of the RNN and introduced many\nvariants. Among others, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is one of the most widely\nused RNN model. However, GRU lacks the capability of adaptively paying\nattention to certain regions or locations, so that it may cause information\nredundancy or loss during leaning. In this paper, we propose a RNN model,\ncalled Recurrent Attention Unit (RAU), which seamlessly integrates the\nattention mechanism into the interior of GRU by adding an attention gate. The\nattention gate can enhance GRU's ability to remember long-term memory and help\nmemory cells quickly discard unimportant content. RAU is capable of extracting\ninformation from the sequential data by adaptively selecting a sequence of\nregions or locations and pay more attention to the selected regions during\nlearning. Extensive experiments on image classification, sentiment\nclassification and language modeling show that RAU consistently outperforms GRU\nand other baseline methods.\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-30T14:09:19Z  (*Updated: 2018-10-30T14:09:19Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Implicitly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Zhifang Sui, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei, Yaru Hao, Li Dong, Yutao Sun, Damai Dai*\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained language models have shown surprising in-context learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, its working mechanism still remains an open question. In this paper, we explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand in-context learning as implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. We comprehensively compare the behaviors of in-context learning and explicit finetuning on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. Experimental results show that in-context learning behaves similarly to explicit finetuning from multiple perspectives. Inspired by the dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with gradient descent with momentum. The improved performance over vanilla attention further supports our understanding from another perspective, and more importantly, shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model design.

Forging Multiple Training Objectives for Pre-trained Language Models via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning language models\"*\n\n*Min Zhang, Fei Huang, Pengjun Xie, Boli Chen, Hai Zhao, Ruixue Ding, Hongqiu Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Multiple pre-training objectives fill the vacancy of the understanding capability of single-objective language modeling, which serves the ultimate purpose of pre-trained language models (PrLMs), generalizing well on a mass of scenarios. However, learning multiple training objectives in a single model is challenging due to the unknown relative significance as well as the potential contrariety between them. Empirical studies have shown that the current objective sampling in an ad-hoc manual setting makes the learned language representation barely converge to the desired optimum. Thus, we propose \\textit{MOMETAS}, a novel adaptive sampler based on meta-learning, which learns the latent sampling pattern on arbitrary pre-training objectives. Such a design is lightweight with negligible additional training overhead. To validate our approach, we adopt five objectives and conduct continual pre-training with BERT-base and BERT-large models, where MOMETAS demonstrates universal performance gain over other rule-based sampling strategies on 14 natural language processing tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty compression neural\"*\n\n*Julien Cornebise, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Charles Blundell, Daan Wierstra*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new, efficient, principled and backpropagation-compatible\nalgorithm for learning a probability distribution on the weights of a neural\nnetwork, called Bayes by Backprop. It regularises the weights by minimising a\ncompression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower\nbound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of\nregularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST\nclassification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights\ncan be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and\nhow this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off in reinforcement learning.\n\n**Published:** 2015-05-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Estimating the warm dark matter mass from strong lensing images with truncated marginal neural ratio estimation\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty compression neural\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Precision analysis of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing images provides a unique way of characterizing small-scale dark matter halos, and could allow us to uncover the fundamental properties of dark matter's constituents. Recently, gravitational imaging techniques made it possible to detect a few heavy subhalos. However, gravitational lenses contain numerous subhalos and line-of-sight halos, whose subtle imprint is extremely difficult to detect individually. Existing methods for marginalizing over this large population of sub-threshold perturbers to infer population-level parameters are typically computationally expensive, or require compressing observations into hand-crafted summary statistics, such as a power spectrum of residuals. Here, we present the first analysis pipeline to combine parametric lensing models and a recently-developed neural simulation-based inference technique called truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) to constrain the warm dark matter halo mass function cutoff scale directly from multiple lensing images. Through a proof-of-concept application to simulated data, we show that our approach enables empirically testable inference of the dark matter cutoff mass through marginalization over a large population of realistic perturbers that would be undetectable on their own, and over lens and source parameters uncertainties. To obtain our results, we combine the signal contained in a set of images with Hubble Space Telescope resolution. Our results suggest that TMNRE can be a powerful approach to put tight constraints on the mass of warm dark matter in the multi-keV regime, which will be relevant both for existing lensing data and in the large sample of lenses that will be delivered by near-future telescopes.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-18\n\n\n\n#### 5. LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

A Combinatorial Perspective on Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Joel Veness, Marcus Hutter, David Budden, Eren Sezener, Jianan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence is characterized not only by the capacity to learn complex skills, but the ability to rapidly adapt and acquire new skills within an ever-changing environment. In this work we study how the learning of modular solutions can allow for effective generalization to both unseen and potentially differently distributed data. Our main postulate is that the combination of task segmentation, modular learning and memory-based ensembling can give rise to generalization on an exponentially growing number of unseen tasks. We provide a concrete instantiation of this idea using a combination of: (1) the Forget-Me-Not Process, for task segmentation and memory based ensembling; and (2) Gated Linear Networks, which in contrast to contemporary deep learning techniques use a modular and local learning mechanism. We demonstrate that this system exhibits a number of desirable continual learning properties: robustness to catastrophic forgetting, no negative transfer and increasing levels of positive transfer as more tasks are seen. We show competitive performance against both offline and online methods on standard continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating meta-learning frameworks with test-time training, focusing on adaptive update rules, dynamic parameter adjustment, uncertainty estimation, and gating mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Meta-Learning Frameworks in Language Models\n\n- **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)**: This approach is particularly relevant as it aims to find a good initialization for model parameters that can be fine-tuned with a few gradient steps on new tasks. MAML can be adapted for test-time training by meta-learning the update rules, allowing the model to adapt quickly to new data.\n- **Optimization-Based Meta-Learning**: Techniques like MAML can be integrated into autoregressive models to enable rapid adaptation during test-time training. This involves optimizing the model's parameters to be adaptable across various tasks, which is crucial for autoregressive models that need to generate coherent text based on new inputs.\n\n## Adaptive Update Rules and Dynamic Parameter Adjustment\n\n- **Meta-Learned Update Rules**: Research on meta-learning can provide insights into how to learn update rules that are effective during test-time. For example, meta-learning can help in learning the learning rate and other hyperparameters that are optimal for adapting to new data.\n- **Continual Meta-Learning**: This approach allows models to learn continuously from new tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. It is particularly useful in autoregressive models where the model needs to adapt to new contexts and tasks dynamically.\n\n## Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks and Compression\n\n- **Uncertainty-Aware Compression**: To achieve efficient compression while preserving information, techniques such as Bayesian neural networks or uncertainty quantification methods can be employed. These methods help in estimating the uncertainty of the model's predictions, which can then be used to compress the model while preserving critical information.\n- **State-of-the-Art Compression Techniques**: Recent research on compression techniques, such as those involving pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation, can be integrated with uncertainty estimation to ensure that the compressed model retains its performance. For instance, using uncertainty to guide pruning can help in removing less important weights while preserving the model's accuracy.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Adaptive Gating**: Adaptive gating mechanisms can be used to control the flow of information in the model, enhancing its expressiveness while managing computational costs. For example, gated linear attention transformers can be optimized for hardware-efficient training, which is crucial for real-time applications of autoregressive models.\n- **Comparison with Existing Gating Approaches**: Comparing different gating architectures, such as those using linear attention or multi-head attention, can help in identifying the most effective and efficient gating mechanisms for autoregressive models. Research like \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" can provide valuable insights.\n\n## Hybrid Approaches Combining Meta-Learning, Uncertainty-Aware Compression, and Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Integration of Meta-Learning with Gating Mechanisms**: Combining meta-learning with adaptive gating mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while controlling the flow of information efficiently. This integration can be explored in the context of test-time training to ensure the model adapts quickly and effectively.\n- **Uncertainty-Aware Compression in Meta-Learning Frameworks**: Incorporating uncertainty estimation into meta-learning frameworks can help in compressing the model while ensuring that the critical information is preserved. This approach can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive models where both adaptability and efficiency are crucial.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **Meta-Learning in Language Models**:\n   - Investigate how meta-learning frameworks like MAML and continual meta-learning can be applied to autoregressive models for test-time training.\n   - Explore best practices for meta-learning in autoregressive models and compare meta-learned update rules with fixed update rules.\n\n2. **Uncertainty-Aware Compression Techniques**:\n   - Research state-of-the-art approaches to uncertainty-aware compression and their impact on model performance.\n   - Analyze the trade-offs between compression ratio and information preservation.\n\n3. **Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - Investigate recent advances in adaptive gating mechanisms and their applications in autoregressive models.\n   - Compare different gating architectures and evaluate their computational costs.\n\n4. **Hybrid Approaches**:\n   - Look for papers and research that combine meta-learning, uncertainty-aware compression, and gating mechanisms.\n   - Evaluate the performance and efficiency of these hybrid approaches in the context of autoregressive language models.\n\nBy following this structured approach, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of how to integrate meta-learning, uncertainty-aware compression, and adaptive gating mechanisms to improve the design and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/40 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n# Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts \n\nAlexis Chevalier* Alexander Wettig* Anirudh Ajith Danqi Chen<br>Department of Computer Science \\& Princeton Language and Intelligence<br>Princeton University<br>\\{achevalier, anirudh.ajith\\}@princeton.edu<br>\\{awettig, danqic\\}@cs.princeton.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents.\n```\n\n#### 3. Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer. We open-source our model for reproducibility purposes in Jax.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\n## References\n\nNaman Agarwal, Rohan Anil, Elad Hazan, Tomer Koren, and Cyril Zhang. 2020.

Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test time training language models\"*\n\n*Manli Shu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Zhiding Yu, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Chaowei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) is proposed, a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample and performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test time training language models\"*\n\n*Shuai Zhao, Xiaohan Wang, Linchao Zhu, Yezhou Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident, and builds different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation~(TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed \\textit{reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback~(RLCF)} framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

Frequency-Domain Dynamic Pruning for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Z. Liu, Jizheng Xu, Xiulian Peng, Ruiqin Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform previous spatial-domain counterparts by a large margin and can achieve a compression ratio of 8.4x and a theoretical inference speed-up of 9.2x for ResNet-110, while the accuracy is even better than the reference model on CIFAR-110.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated their powerfulness in a variety of applications. However, the storage and computational requirements have largely restricted their further extensions on mobile devices. Recently, pruning of unimportant parameters has been used for both network compression and acceleration. Considering that there are spatial redundancy within most filters in a CNN, we propose a frequency-domain dynamic pruning scheme to exploit the spatial correlations. The frequency-domain coefficients are pruned dynamically in each iteration and different frequency bands are pruned discriminatively, given their different importance on accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform previous spatial-domain counterparts by a large margin. Specifically, it can achieve a compression ratio of 8.4x and a theoretical inference speed-up of 9.2x for ResNet-110, while the accuracy is even better than the reference model on CIFAR-110.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 130  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic BERT model, which can run at adaptive width and depth, is proposed (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computational and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually reduce the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size, and can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can run at adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allows both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 296  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 5. Task-aware Distributed Source Coding under Dynamic Bandwidth\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Po-han Li, S. Ankireddy, Ruihan Zhao, Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub, Ehsan Moradi-Pari, U. Topcu, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Hyeji Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead and improving the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient compression of correlated data is essential to minimize communication overload in multi-sensor networks. In such networks, each sensor independently compresses the data and transmits them to a central node due to limited communication bandwidth. A decoder at the central node decompresses and passes the data to a pre-trained machine learning-based task to generate the final output. Thus, it is important to compress the features that are relevant to the task. Additionally, the final performance depends heavily on the total available bandwidth. In practice, it is common to encounter varying availability in bandwidth, and higher bandwidth results in better performance of the task. We design a novel distributed compression framework composed of independent encoders and a joint decoder, which we call neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA). NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead. NDPCA achieves this by learning low-rank task representations and efficiently distributing bandwidth among sensors, thus providing a graceful trade-off between performance and bandwidth. Experiments show that NDPCA improves the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation by 9% and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery by 14% compared to an autoencoder with uniform bandwidth allocation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 7. DELTA: degradation-free fully test-time adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Bowen Zhao, Chen Chen, Shutao Xia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics, and Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies like test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal that the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second, we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time adaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a newly introduced real-world dataset. DELTA can help them deal with all scenarios simultaneously, leading to SOTA performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. ViDA: Homeostatic Visual Domain Adapter for Continual Test Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Jiaming Liu, Senqiao Yang, Peidong Jia, Ming Lu, Yandong Guo, Wei Xue, Shanghang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA is designed, explicitly handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge, and a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy is proposed, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA.\n\n**Abstract:** Since real-world machine systems are running in non-stationary environments, Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task is proposed to adapt the pre-trained model to continually changing target domains. Recently, existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation, which aims to leverage a self-training manner to extract the target domain knowledge. However, pseudo labels can be noisy and the updated model parameters are unreliable under dynamic data distributions, leading to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in the continual adaptation process. To tackle these challenges and maintain the model plasticity, we design a Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA, explicitly handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge. Specifically, we first comprehensively explore the different domain representations of the adapters with trainable high-rank or low-rank embedding spaces. Then we inject ViDAs into the pre-trained model, which leverages high-rank and low-rank features to adapt the current domain distribution and maintain the continual domain-shared knowledge, respectively. To exploit the low-rank and high-rank ViDAs more effectively, we further propose a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Note that, our method can be regarded as a novel transfer paradigm for large-scale models, delivering promising results in adaptation to continually changing distributions.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test time training language models\"*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding\nretrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the\nretrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input\nlength grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and\nmemory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these\ncomplications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time,\nusing its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index\nbased on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system\nretrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly,\nretrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient\niteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language\nmodeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest\nneighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a\nGPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size,\nhowever, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time\ntraining for language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-29T08:03:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-02T20:28:27Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. XNLI 2.0: Improving XNLI dataset and performance on Cross Lingual\n  Understanding (XLU)\n\n*From Search Query: \"test time training language models\"*\n\n*Ankit Kumar Upadhyay, Harsit Kumar Upadhya*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural Language Processing systems are heavily dependent on the availability\nof annotated data to train practical models. Primarily, models are trained on\nEnglish datasets. In recent times, significant advances have been made in\nmultilingual understanding due to the steeply increasing necessity of working\nin different languages. One of the points that stands out is that since there\nare now so many pre-trained multilingual models, we can utilize them for\ncross-lingual understanding tasks. Using cross-lingual understanding and\nNatural Language Inference, it is possible to train models whose applications\nextend beyond the training language. We can leverage the power of machine\ntranslation to skip the tiresome part of translating datasets from one language\nto another. In this work, we focus on improving the original XNLI dataset by\nre-translating the MNLI dataset in all of the 14 different languages present in\nXNLI, including the test and dev sets of XNLI using Google Translate. We also\nperform experiments by training models in all 15 languages and analyzing their\nperformance on the task of natural language inference. We then expand our\nboundary to investigate if we could improve performance in low-resource\nlanguages such as Swahili and Urdu by training models in languages other than\nEnglish.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-16T17:24:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-16T17:24:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. NTK-approximating MLP Fusion for Efficient Language Model Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Tianxin Wei, Zeming Guo, Yifan Chen, Jingrui He*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM) emerges as the predominant\nstrategy in many natural language processing applications. However, even\nfine-tuning the PLMs and doing inference are expensive, especially on edge\ndevices with low computing power. Some general approaches (e.g. quantization\nand distillation) have been widely studied to reduce the compute/memory of PLM\nfine-tuning, while very few one-shot compression techniques are explored. In\nthis paper, we investigate the neural tangent kernel (NTK)--which reveals the\ngradient descent dynamics of neural networks--of the multilayer perceptrons\n(MLP) modules in a PLM and propose to coin a lightweight PLM through\nNTK-approximating MLP fusion. To achieve this, we reconsider the MLP as a\nbundle of sub-MLPs, and cluster them into a given number of centroids, which\ncan then be restored as a compressed MLP and surprisingly shown to well\napproximate the NTK of the original PLM. Extensive experiments of PLM\nfine-tuning on both natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG)\ntasks are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method MLP\nfusion.

Multi-Layer Softmaxing during Training Neural Machine Translation for\n  Flexible Decoding with Fewer Layers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Raj Dabre, Atsushi Fujita*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel procedure for training an encoder-decoder based\ndeep neural network which compresses NxM models into a single model enabling us\nto dynamically choose the number of encoder and decoder layers for decoding.\nUsually, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the\nM-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute\nsoftmax loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM\nlosses: the softmax loss for the output of each of the M decoder layers derived\nusing the output of each of the N encoder layers. A single model trained by our\nmethod can be used for decoding with an arbitrary fewer number of encoder and\ndecoder layers. In practical scenarios, this (a) enables faster decoding with\ninsignificant losses in translation quality and (b) alleviates the need to\ntrain NxM models, thereby saving space. We take a case study of neural machine\ntranslation and show the advantage and give a cost-benefit analysis of our\napproach.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-27T10:17:24Z  (*Updated: 2019-08-28T09:11:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. TADA: Efficient Task-Agnostic Domain Adaptation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Chia-Chien Hung, Lukas Lange, Jannik Str\u00f6tgen*\n\n**Abstract:** Intermediate training of pre-trained transformer-based language models on\ndomain-specific data leads to substantial gains for downstream tasks. To\nincrease efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting alleviated from full\ndomain-adaptive pre-training, approaches such as adapters have been developed.\nHowever, these require additional parameters for each layer, and are criticized\nfor their limited expressiveness. In this work, we introduce TADA, a novel\ntask-agnostic domain adaptation method which is modular, parameter-efficient,\nand thus, data-efficient. Within TADA, we retrain the embeddings to learn\ndomain-aware input representations and tokenizers for the transformer encoder,\nwhile freezing all other parameters of the model. Then, task-specific\nfine-tuning is performed. We further conduct experiments with meta-embeddings\nand newly introduced meta-tokenizers, resulting in one model per task in\nmulti-domain use cases. Our broad evaluation in 4 downstream tasks for 14\ndomains across single- and multi-domain setups and high- and low-resource\nscenarios reveals that TADA is an effective and efficient alternative to full\ndomain-adaptive pre-training and adapters for domain adaptation, while not\nintroducing additional parameters or complex training steps.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22T04:53:59Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-22T04:53:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Selecting Informative Contexts Improves Language Model Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"test time training language models\"*\n\n*Nicole Beckage, Richard Antonello, Javier Turek, Alexander Huth*\n\n**Abstract:** Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Further, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a test metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning -- we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Efficient neural networks for real-time modeling of analog dynamic range compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Joshua D. Reiss, Christian J. Steinmetz*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches have demonstrated success in modeling analog audio effects. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling more complex effects that involve time-varying nonlinear elements, such as dynamic range compressors. Existing neural network approaches for modeling compression either ignore the device parameters, do not attain sufficient accuracy, or otherwise require large noncausal models prohibiting real-time operation. In this work, we propose a modification to temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) enabling greater efficiency without sacrificing performance. By utilizing very sparse convolutional kernels through rapidly growing dilations, our model attains a significant receptive field using fewer layers, reducing computation. Through a detailed evaluation we demonstrate our efficient and causal approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling the analog LA-2A, is capable of real-time operation on CPU, and only requires 10 minutes of training data.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. SCOP: Scientific Control for Reliable Neural Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Chang Xu, Chao Xu, Chunjing Xu, DaCheng Tao, Yixing Xu, Yunhe Wang, Yehui Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a reliable neural network pruning algorithm by setting up a scientific control. Existing pruning methods have developed various hypotheses to approximate the importance of filters to the network and then execute filter pruning accordingly. To increase the reliability of the results, we prefer to have a more rigorous research design by including a scientific control group as an essential part to minimize the effect of all factors except the association between the filter and expected network output. Acting as a control group, knockoff feature is generated to mimic the feature map produced by the network filter, but they are conditionally independent of the example label given the real feature map. We theoretically suggest that the knockoff condition can be approximately preserved given the information propagation of network layers. Besides the real feature map on an intermediate layer, the corresponding knockoff feature is brought in as another auxiliary input signal for the subsequent layers. Redundant filters can be discovered in the adversarial process of different features. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method can reduce 57.8% parameters and 60.2% FLOPs of ResNet-101 with only 0.01% top-1 accuracy loss on ImageNet.

Adaptive and Background-Aware Vision Transformer for Real-Time UAV Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Xucheng Wang, Dan Zeng, Yangxiang Yang, Shuiwang Li*\n\n**Abstract:**     While discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers prevail in UAV tracking for their favorable efficiency, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based trackers using filter pruning have also demonstrated remarkable efficiency and precision. However, the use of pure vision transformer models (ViTs) for UAV tracking remains unexplored, which is a surprising finding given that ViTs have been shown to produce better performance and greater efficiency than CNNs in image classification. In this paper, we propose an efficient ViT-based tracking framework, Aba-ViTrack, for UAV tracking. In our framework, feature learning and template-search coupling are integrated into an efficient one-stream ViT to avoid an extra heavy relation modeling module. The proposed Aba-ViT exploits an adaptive and background-aware token computation method to reduce inference time. This approach adaptively discards tokens based on learned halting probabilities, which a priori are higher for background tokens than target ones. Extensive experiments on six UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Aba-ViTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in UAV tracking. Code is available at https://github.com/xyyang317/Aba-ViTrack.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Real-Time Exposure Correction via Collaborative Transformations and Adaptive Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: \"real-time adaptation transformers\"*\n\n*Nong Sang, Yuehuan Wang, Yuanjie Shao, Jinpu Zhang, Meng Cao, Feng Zhang, Ziwen Li*\n\n**Abstract:**     Most of the previous exposure correction methods learn dense pixel-wise transformations to achieve promising results but consume huge computational resources. Recently Learnable 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and efficiency for image enhancement. However these methods can only perform global transformations and fail to finely manipulate local regions. Moreover they uniformly downsample the input image which loses the rich color information and limits the learning of color transformation capabilities. In this paper we present a collaborative transformation framework (CoTF) for real-time exposure correction which integrates global transformation with pixel-wise transformations in an efficient manner. Specifically the global transformation adjusts the overall appearance using image-adaptive 3D LUTs to provide decent global contrast and sharp details while the pixel transformation compensates for local context. Then a relation-aware modulation module is designed to combine these two components effectively. In addition we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to preserve more color information by predicting the sampling intervals thus providing higher quality input data for the learning of 3D LUTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can process high-resolution images in real-time on GPUs while achieving comparable performance against current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HUST-IAL/CoTF.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on test-time training, dynamic compression, and real-time adaptation, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Test-Time Training in Language Models\n\n- **Test-time fine-tuning** has been shown to significantly improve language modeling ability. This approach involves fine-tuning the parameters of a pre-trained model at test-time specifically to each prompt. It has been found to perform substantially better than in-context learning, especially for underrepresented tasks and with larger models.\n\n- The paper \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" discusses how test-time fine-tuning can be made more efficient by adaptively stopping the fine-tuning process based on the realized performance gains, making it computationally scalable.\n\n## Dynamic Compression Techniques\n\n- **Uncertainty-aware compression** is a promising area. While the initial references provide a foundation in weight uncertainty and transitional uncertainty, integrating these concepts into test-time training is crucial. For example, using uncertainty estimation to guide dynamic compression can help in preserving important features during test-time adaptation. However, specific implementations of this in language models are still needed.\n\n## Real-Time Adaptation Mechanisms in Transformers\n\n- **Meta-learning** can be integrated with real-time adaptation mechanisms. Hu et al.'s work on meta-learning for online adaptation of language models shows how a small, autoregressive model can be meta-trained to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, improving information uptake.\n\n- **Adaptive gating mechanisms** can enhance real-time adaptation. Li et al.'s work on adaptive gating in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrates a flexible training strategy where tokens are processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution. Combining this with meta-learning frameworks could be beneficial.\n\n## Combining Multiple Adaptation Strategies\n\n- The concept of **\"compute-optimal\" scaling strategies** for test-time compute, as discussed in the paper \"Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally,\" suggests allocating test-time compute adaptively per prompt. This can involve modifying the model's predicted distribution at test time using verifiers or reward models, which can be combined with meta-learning and adaptive gating to enhance performance.\n\n- **Chain of thought** techniques, as seen in OpenAI's o1 model, involve using human-interpretable chains of thought and backtracking to solve complex problems. Integrating these techniques with test-time fine-tuning and adaptive mechanisms could further enhance the model's ability to adapt and reason at test time.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on:\n\n- Implementing **test-time fine-tuning** that adapts to the prompt and available data, ensuring computational scalability.\n- Integrating **uncertainty-aware compression** techniques to dynamically compress the model during test-time training.\n- Combining **meta-learning** with **adaptive gating mechanisms** to enhance real-time adaptation and information uptake.\n- Utilizing **compute-optimal scaling strategies** and **chain of thought** techniques to optimize test-time compute and improve reasoning capabilities.\n\nThese approaches can help in creating a more efficient, adaptable, and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA), is proposed, introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

LM-Polygraph: Uncertainty Estimation for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*Ekaterina Fadeeva, Roman Vashurin, Akim Tsvigun, Artem Vazhentsev, Sergey Petrakov, Kirill Fedyanin, Daniil Vasilev, Elizaveta Goncharova, Alexander Panchenko, Maxim Panov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov*\n\n**TL;DR:** LM-Polygraph is introduced, a framework with implementations of a battery of state-of-the-art UE methods for LLMs in text generation tasks, with unified program interfaces in Python, and introduces an extendable benchmark for consistent evaluation of UE techniques by researchers.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for a myriad of groundbreaking applications in various fields. However, a significant challenge arises as these models often\"hallucinate\", i.e., fabricate facts without providing users an apparent means to discern the veracity of their statements. Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods are one path to safer, more responsible, and more effective use of LLMs. However, to date, research on UE methods for LLMs has been focused primarily on theoretical rather than engineering contributions. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing LM-Polygraph, a framework with implementations of a battery of state-of-the-art UE methods for LLMs in text generation tasks, with unified program interfaces in Python. Additionally, it introduces an extendable benchmark for consistent evaluation of UE techniques by researchers, and a demo web application that enriches the standard chat dialog with confidence scores, empowering end-users to discern unreliable responses. LM-Polygraph is compatible with the most recent LLMs, including BLOOMz, LLaMA-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, and is designed to support future releases of similarly-styled LMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Improving Instruction Following in Language Models through Proxy-Based Uncertainty Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*Joonho Lee, Jae Oh Woo, Juree Seok, Parisa Hassanzadeh, Wooseok Jang, JuYoun Son, Sima Didari, Baruch Gutow, Heng Hao, Hankyu Moon, Wenjun Hu, Yeong-Dae Kwon, Taehee Lee, Seungjai Min*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation and trains a uncertainty-enabled proxy that not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates their inherent uncertainty.\n\n**Abstract:** Assessing response quality to instructions in language models is vital but challenging due to the complexity of human language across different contexts. This complexity often results in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations, making accurate assessment difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation. Trained with preference datasets, our uncertainty-enabled proxy not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates their inherent uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate significant benefits of incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training. Our method boosts the instruction following capability of language models by refining data curation for training and improving policy optimization objectives, thereby surpassing existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as Vicuna and MT-bench. These findings highlight that our proposed approach substantially advances language model training and paves a new way of harnessing uncertainty within language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Semantic Uncertainty: Linguistic Invariances for Uncertainty Estimation in Natural Language Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*Lorenz Kuhn, Y. Gal, Sebastian Farquhar*\n\n**TL;DR:** In comprehensive ablation studies, it is shown that the semantic entropy is more predictive of model accuracy on question answering data sets than comparable baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a method to measure uncertainty in large language models. For tasks like question answering, it is essential to know when we can trust the natural language outputs of foundation models. We show that measuring uncertainty in natural language is challenging because of\"semantic equivalence\"-- different sentences can mean the same thing. To overcome these challenges we introduce semantic entropy -- an entropy which incorporates linguistic invariances created by shared meanings. Our method is unsupervised, uses only a single model, and requires no modifications to off-the-shelf language models. In comprehensive ablation studies we show that the semantic entropy is more predictive of model accuracy on question answering data sets than comparable baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 157  (*Influential: 47*)\n\n#### 4. Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning with In-Distribution Online Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Jianhao Wang, Jin Zhang, Haozhe Jiang, Junyu Zhang, Liwei Wang, Chongjie Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel adaptation framework, called In-Distribution online Adaptation with uncertainty Quantification (IDAQ), which generates in-distribution context using a given uncertainty quantification and performs effective task belief inference to address new tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent offline meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods typically utilize task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual task) to collect a multi-task dataset. However, these methods always require extra information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks. To address this problem, we first formally characterize a unique challenge in offline meta-RL: transition-reward distribution shift between offline datasets and online adaptation. Our theory finds that out-of-distribution adaptation episodes may lead to unreliable policy evaluation and that online adaptation with in-distribution episodes can ensure adaptation performance guarantee. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel adaptation framework, called In-Distribution online Adaptation with uncertainty Quantification (IDAQ), which generates in-distribution context using a given uncertainty quantification and performs effective task belief inference to address new tasks. We find a return-based uncertainty quantification for IDAQ that performs effectively. Experiments show that IDAQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Online Learning via Meta-Learning: Continual Adaptation for Model-Based RL\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Anusha Nagabandi, Chelsea Finn, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models, and demonstrates that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.\n\n**Abstract:** Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Test Time Adapter Ensembling for Low-resource Language Varieties\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Xinyi Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Sebastian Ruder, Graham Neubig*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper finds that ensembling multiple existing language adapters makes the fine-tuned model significantly more robust to other language varieties not included in these adapters, and proposes EMA, a method that optimizes the ensemble weights of the pretrained language adapters for each test sentence by minimizing the entropy of its predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapters are light-weight modules that allow parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models. Specialized language and task adapters have recently been proposed to facilitate cross-lingual transfer of multilingual pretrained models (Pfeiffer et al., 2020b). However, this approach requires training a separate language adapter for every language one wishes to support, which can be impractical for languages with limited data. An intuitive solution is to use a related language adapter for the new language variety, but we observe that this solution can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of language adapters to uncovered languages without training new adapters. We find that ensembling multiple existing language adapters makes the fine-tuned model significantly more robust to other language varieties not included in these adapters. Building upon this observation, we propose Entropy Minimized Ensemble of Adapters (EMEA), a method that optimizes the ensemble weights of the pretrained language adapters for each test sentence by minimizing the entropy of its predictions. Experiments on three diverse groups of language varieties show that our method leads to significant improvements on both named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging across all languages.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 552  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 8. Selective Annotation Makes Language Models Better Few-Shot Learners\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Hongjin Su, Jungo Kasai, Chen Henry Wu, Weijia Shi, Tianlu Wang, Jiayi Xin, Rui Zhang, Mari Ostendorf, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Tao Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work forms an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time, and proposes an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotation.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent approaches to natural language tasks are built on the remarkable abilities of large language models. Large language models can perform in-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task demonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the implications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new natural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we formulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets (covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code generation) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task performance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4% relative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly selecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised finetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less annotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our framework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative selective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain shift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as large language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

CLUE: Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*Yu-Hsiang Wang, Andrew Bai, Che-Ping Tsai, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in\nvarious natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Previous studies suggest that\nLLMs' generation process involves uncertainty. However, existing approaches to\nuncertainty estimation mainly focus on sequence-level uncertainty, overlooking\nindividual pieces of information within sequences. These methods fall short in\nseparately assessing the uncertainty of each component in a sequence. In\nresponse, we propose a novel framework for Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation\n(CLUE) for LLMs. We leverage LLMs to convert output sequences into\nconcept-level representations, breaking down sequences into individual concepts\nand measuring the uncertainty of each concept separately. We conduct\nexperiments to demonstrate that CLUE can provide more interpretable uncertainty\nestimation results compared with sentence-level uncertainty, and could be a\nuseful tool for various tasks such as hallucination detection and story\ngeneration.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-04T18:27:12Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-04T18:27:12Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Online Adaptation of Language Models with a Memory of Amortized Contexts\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Jihoon Tack, Jaehyung Kim, Eric Mitchell, Jinwoo Shin, Yee Whye Teh, Jonathan Richard Schwarz*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the rapid generation and dissemination of information, large language\nmodels (LLMs) quickly run out of date despite enormous development costs. Due\nto this crucial need to keep models updated, online learning has emerged as a\ncritical necessity when utilizing LLMs for real-world applications. However,\ngiven the ever-expanding corpus of unseen documents and the large parameter\nspace of modern LLMs, efficient adaptation is essential. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Memory of Amortized Contexts (MAC), an efficient and\neffective online adaptation framework for LLMs with strong knowledge retention.\nWe propose an amortized feature extraction and memory-augmentation approach to\ncompress and extract information from new documents into compact modulations\nstored in a memory bank. When answering questions, our model attends to and\nextracts relevant knowledge from this memory bank. To learn informative\nmodulations in an efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based\nmeta-learning, which substitutes the optimization process with a single forward\npass of the encoder. Subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate\nselected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question,\nallowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring\nfurther gradient updates. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of MAC in\nmultiple aspects, including online adaptation performance, time, and memory\nefficiency.

Meta-Learning for Low-resource Natural Language Generation in\n  Task-oriented Dialogue Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Fei Mi, Minlie Huang, Jiyong Zhang, Boi Faltings*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural language generation (NLG) is an essential component of task-oriented\ndialogue systems. Despite the recent success of neural approaches for NLG, they\nare typically developed for particular domains with rich annotated training\nexamples. In this paper, we study NLG in a low-resource setting to generate\nsentences in new scenarios with handful training examples. We formulate the\nproblem from a meta-learning perspective, and propose a generalized\noptimization-based approach (Meta-NLG) based on the well-recognized\nmodel-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm. Meta-NLG defines a set of meta\ntasks, and directly incorporates the objective of adapting to new low-resource\nNLG tasks into the meta-learning optimization process. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on a large multi-domain dataset (MultiWoz) with diverse\nlinguistic variations. We show that Meta-NLG significantly outperforms other\ntraining procedures in various low-resource configurations. We analyze the\nresults, and demonstrate that Meta-NLG adapts extremely fast and well to\nlow-resource situations.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-14T14:35:06Z  (*Updated: 2019-05-14T14:35:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Task-oriented Memory-efficient Pruning-Adapter\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Guorun Wang, Jun Yang, Yaoru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** The Outstanding performance and growing size of Large Language Models has led\nto increased attention in parameter efficient learning. The two predominant\napproaches are Adapters and Pruning. Adapters are to freeze the model and give\nit a new weight matrix on the side, which can significantly reduce the time and\nmemory of training, but the cost is that the evaluation and testing will\nincrease the time and memory consumption. Pruning is to cut off some weight and\nre-distribute the remaining weight, which sacrifices the complexity of training\nat the cost of extremely high memory and training time, making the cost of\nevaluation and testing relatively low. So efficiency of training and inference\ncan't be obtained in the same time. In this work, we propose a task-oriented\nPruning-Adapter method that achieve a high memory efficiency of training and\nmemory, and speeds up training time and ensures no significant decrease in\naccuracy in GLUE tasks, achieving training and inference efficiency at the same\ntime.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-26T12:18:00Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-06T03:44:38Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Semantically Diverse Language Generation for Uncertainty Estimation in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*Sepp Hochreiter, Mykyta Ielanskyi, Kajetan Schweighofer, Lukas Aichberger*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can suffer from hallucinations when generating text. These hallucinations impede various applications in society and industry by making LLMs untrustworthy. Current LLMs generate text in an autoregressive fashion by predicting and appending text tokens. When an LLM is uncertain about the semantic meaning of the next tokens to generate, it is likely to start hallucinating. Thus, it has been suggested that hallucinations stem from predictive uncertainty. We introduce Semantically Diverse Language Generation (SDLG) to quantify predictive uncertainty in LLMs. SDLG steers the LLM to generate semantically diverse yet likely alternatives for an initially generated text. This approach provides a precise measure of aleatoric semantic uncertainty, detecting whether the initial text is likely to be hallucinated. Experiments on question-answering tasks demonstrate that SDLG consistently outperforms existing methods while being the most computationally efficient, setting a new standard for uncertainty estimation in LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. DebUnc: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Model Agent Communication with Uncertainty Estimations\n\n*From Search Query: \"uncertainty estimation language models\"*\n\n*William Yang Wang, Alfonso Amayuelas, Luke Yoffe*\n\n**Abstract:** To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents. This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates. To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels. We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase.

Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Chelsea Finn, Christopher D. Manning, Eric Mitchell, Nathan Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective \"shelf life.\" While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 4. Fast Online Adaptation in Robotics through Meta-Learning Embeddings of Simulated Priors\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta learning online adaptation\"*\n\n*Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Timoth\u00e9e Anne, Rituraj Kaushik*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning algorithms can accelerate the model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms by finding an initial set of parameters for the dynamical model such that the model can be trained to match the actual dynamics of the system with only a few data-points. However, in the real world, a robot might encounter any situation starting from motor failures to finding itself in a rocky terrain where the dynamics of the robot can be significantly different from one another. In this paper, first, we show that when meta-training situations (the prior situations) have such diverse dynamics, using a single set of meta-trained parameters as a starting point still requires a large number of observations from the real system to learn a useful model of the dynamics. Second, we propose an algorithm called FAMLE that mitigates this limitation by meta-training several initial starting points (i.e., initial parameters) for training the model and allows the robot to select the most suitable starting point to adapt the model to the current situation with only a few gradient steps. We compare FAMLE to MBRL, MBRL with a meta-trained model with MAML, and model-free policy search algorithm PPO for various simulated and real robotic tasks, and show that FAMLE allows the robots to adapt to novel damages in significantly fewer time-steps than the baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Mingxing Tan, Quoc V. Le, Ruoming Pang*\n\n**Abstract:** Model efficiency has become increasingly important in computer vision. In this paper, we systematically study neural network architecture design choices for object detection and propose several key optimizations to improve efficiency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), which allows easy and fast multiscale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class prediction networks at the same time. Based on these optimizations and better backbones, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve much better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, with single model and single-scale, our EfficientDet-D7 achieves state-of-the-art 55.1 AP on COCO test-dev with 77M parameters and 410B FLOPs, being 4x - 9x smaller and using 13x - 42x fewer FLOPs than previous detectors.

CAT-LM: Training Language Models on Aligned Code And Tests\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient test time\"*\n\n*Vincent J. Hellendoorn, Claire Le Goues, Uri Alon, Kush Jain, Nikitha Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Testing is an integral part of the software development process. Yet, writing tests is time-consuming and therefore often neglected. Classical test generation tools such as EvoSuite generate behavioral test suites by optimizing for coverage, but tend to produce tests that are hard to understand. Language models trained on code can generate code that is highly similar to that written by humans, but current models are trained to generate each file separately, as is standard practice in natural language processing, and thus fail to consider the code-under-test context when producing a test file. In this work, we propose the Aligned Code And Tests Language Model (CAT-LM), a GPT-style language model with 2.7 Billion parameters, trained on a corpus of Python and Java projects. We utilize a novel pretraining signal that explicitly considers the mapping between code and test files when available. We also drastically increase the maximum sequence length of inputs to 8,192 tokens, 4x more than typical code generation models, to ensure that the code context is available to the model when generating test code. We analyze its usefulness for realistic applications, showing that sampling with filtering (e.g., by compilability, coverage) allows it to efficiently produce tests that achieve coverage similar to ones written by developers while resembling their writing style. By utilizing the code context, CAT-LM generates more valid tests than even much larger language models trained with more data (CodeGen 16B and StarCoder) and substantially outperforms a recent test-specific model (TeCo) at test completion. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating software-specific insights when training language models for code and paves the way to more powerful automated test generation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on uncertainty estimation, meta-learning for online adaptation, and parameter-efficient test-time updates, here are some key findings and relevant papers:\n\n## Uncertainty Estimation in Language Models\n\n- **Uncertainty-aware compression techniques** are crucial for efficient adaptation. A paper like \"SNR uncertainty measurement technique\" suggests methods to address prediction errors and improve calibration, which can be applied to uncertainty estimation in language models.\n- The study on \"Generalization v.s. Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data\" discusses how uncertainty and generalization capabilities can be analyzed, which is relevant for understanding how models predict and adapt.\n\n## Meta-Learning for Online Adaptation\n\n- **Meta-learning frameworks** can significantly enhance online adaptation. Papers such as \"When can transformers compositionally generalize in-context?\" and \"The Many Faces of Optimal Weak-to-Strong Learning\" explore how meta-learning can be integrated into language models to improve their adaptability and generalization capabilities.\n- The concept of \"meta-learned update rules\" is discussed in various meta-learning contexts, which can be adapted for language models. For instance, \"Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks\" touches on the idea of learning update rules that could be meta-learned.\n\n## Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Updates\n\n- **Test-Time Training (TTT)** and **Dynamic Compression** are key areas. Papers like \"DELTA: degradation-free fully test-time adaptation\" and \"Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\" provide insights into robust normalization strategies and dynamic reweighting during test-time updates, which are crucial for parameter-efficient adaptation[Analysis Note].\n- **Adaptive KV Cache Compression** for Large Language Models is another relevant study that reduces the memory footprint during generative inference, which aligns with the need for efficient test-time updates.\n\n## Combining Multiple Adaptation Strategies\n\n- The integration of **uncertainty estimation** with **meta-learning** and **adaptive compression** is essential. For example, \"From Internal Conflict to Contextual Adaptation of Language Models\" discusses contextual adaptation, which can be combined with uncertainty estimation and meta-learning frameworks to enhance model performance.\n- **Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models** provides a theoretical framework that could be used to stabilize and optimize the integration of multiple adaptation strategies during test-time updates.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Directions\n\n- **Robust normalization strategies** and **gradient-based sample selection** are critical for stable test-time adaptation. This is highlighted in papers such as \"Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\"[Analysis Note].\n- **Uncertainty-guided compression** and **adaptive compression based on input complexity** are necessary for efficient adaptation. This can be explored further through studies like \"SNR uncertainty measurement technique\".\n- **Meta-learned update rules** integrated with **uncertainty estimation** can enhance online adaptation. This is a promising area for future research, as indicated by various meta-learning studies.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and integrating uncertainty estimation, meta-learning, and parameter-efficient test-time updates, the researchers can develop more robust, adaptable, and efficient autoregressive language models.\n",

Traditional Transformer-based architectures, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational and memory complexities relative to sequence length, limiting their scalability and efficiency. Recent advancements have introduced Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) like Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, which update hidden states during inference to enhance adaptability and performance. However, existing implementations, such as TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, encounter challenges in memory I/O and scalability when dealing with extended contexts.\n\nThe core motivation behind **MetaTTT** is to address these limitations by integrating meta-learning frameworks, gated mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware compression into the TTT GAU. This integration aims to dynamically adapt hidden states during inference, enhancing the model's expressiveness and efficiency without escalating computational demands. By leveraging meta-learning, MetaTTT facilitates rapid adaptation to diverse and out-of-distribution inputs, while gated mechanisms ensure selective information flow, and uncertainty-aware compression optimizes memory usage. Collectively, these enhancements are expected to significantly improve perplexity, downstream task accuracy, robustness, and scalability of LLMs in long-context scenarios.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Test-Time Training and Adaptive Hidden States\n\n**TTT Layers**: The concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, as introduced by Sun et al. [2024], revolutionizes sequence modeling by allowing hidden states to be updated during inference via self-supervised learning. This dynamic adaptation enables models to better generalize to out-of-distribution and long-context tasks.\n\n**Mamba and MambaByte**: Mamba [Gu et al., 2023] and its token-free variant MambaByte [Wang et al., 2024] exemplify Selective State Space Models (SSMs) that achieve linear-time sequence modeling. These models compress context into fixed-size hidden states, balancing computational efficiency with model expressiveness. However, they primarily focus on inference scalability, leaving room for enhancing adaptability and expressiveness through dynamic hidden state updates.\n\n**Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers**: GLA Transformers [Yang et al., 2023] incorporate data-dependent gates within the attention mechanism, maintaining linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness. This architecture serves as a foundation for integrating gating mechanisms into the TTT GAU to improve selective information flow and adaptability.\n\n**Uncertainty-Aware Compression**: UNComp [Xiong et al., 2024] introduces an uncertainty-aware compression scheme for LLMs, adaptively compressing hidden states based on model uncertainty. This approach reduces memory footprint and computational overhead, making it a vital component for enhancing TTT GAUs' efficiency in long-context scenarios.\n\n**Variational Semantic Memory and State-Reification Networks**: These frameworks [Zhen et al., 2020; Lamb et al., 2019] employ probabilistic modeling of hidden states, ensuring robust generalization and adaptability. Integrating probabilistic representations into MetaTTT can enhance the model's ability to maintain hidden state coherence and robustness during dynamic updates.\n\n### Meta-Learning in Sequence Modeling\n\nMeta-learning, or \"learning to learn,\" enables models to adapt rapidly to new tasks with minimal data. In the context of sequence modeling, meta-learning frameworks can empower GAUs to adjust their hidden states dynamically based on incoming sequences, thereby enhancing adaptability and generalization [Ren et al., 2018; Wolf et al., 2024]. By integrating meta-learning into the TTT GAU, MetaTTT aims to facilitate rapid and efficient hidden state adaptations during inference.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with Existing TTT GAUs\n\n1. **Memory I/O Constraints**: TTT-MLP, while more expressive than TTT-Linear, still faces significant challenges in memory I/O, limiting its scalability and efficiency during long-context processing.\n2. **Scalability Limitations**: Current TTT GAUs struggle to maintain low perplexity and high performance as context lengths extend beyond typical training scenarios, hindering their applicability in real-world, long-form content processing.\n3. **Expressiveness vs. Efficiency Trade-off**: Enhancing hidden state expressiveness often comes at the cost of increased computational and memory demands, jeopardizing the model's scalability and real-time inference capabilities.\n\n### MetaTTT's Core Concept\n\n**MetaTTT** seeks to transcend these limitations by:\n- **Integrating Meta-Learning**: Enabling the GAU to adapt its hidden states dynamically through a meta-learned update rule, facilitating rapid and efficient adaptations during inference.\n- **Incorporating Gated Mechanisms**: Enhancing the model's expressiveness and selective information flow without increasing computational complexity.\n- **Implementing Uncertainty-Aware Compression**: Optimizing memory usage by adaptively compressing hidden states based on model uncertainty, ensuring efficient scalability with longer sequences.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nLet \\( X = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_T) \\) denote a sequence of embeddings, where \\( T \\) is the sequence length. The GAU operates as follows:\n\n1. **Meta-Learned Update Rule**:\n   \\[\n   W_{t} = W_{t-1} - \\alpha \\nabla_W \\ell(W_{t-1}; x_t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( W_t \\) represents the hidden state at time \\( t \\), \\( \\alpha \\) is the learning rate, and \\( \\ell \\) is the self-supervised loss function.\n\n2. **Gated Mechanism Integration**:\n   \\[\n   Q_t' = Q_t \\odot G_Q(X, W_t) \\\\\n   K_t' = K_t \\odot G_K(X, W_t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Q_t \\) and \\( K_t \\) are queries and keys at time \\( t \\), and \\( G_Q \\) and \\( G_K \\) are gated functions that modulate the queries and keys based on the current hidden state \\( W_t \\).\n\n3. **Uncertainty-Aware Compression**:\n   \\[\n   W_t' = \\text{Compress}(W_t, U(W_t))\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\text{Compress} \\) is a compression function conditioned on the model's uncertainty \\( U(W_t) \\).\n\nThese formulations ensure that hidden state updates are both dynamically adaptive and memory-efficient, addressing the scalability and expressiveness challenges inherent in existing TTT GAUs.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nTTT\n```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nThe **MetaTTT** GAU enhances the existing TTT GAU by integrating meta-learning frameworks, gated mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware compression. These modifications collectively enable dynamic hidden state adaptations during inference, improved expressiveness, and optimized memory usage, thereby addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges of long-context language modeling.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.

Incorporating Gated Mechanisms for Enhanced Expressiveness\n\n**Objective**: Enhance the expressiveness of the GAU by selectively modulating the flow of information through gated mechanisms.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- **Gated Queries and Keys**: Introduce gating functions \\( G_Q \\) and \\( G_K \\) that control the generation of queries and keys based on the current hidden state.\n  \n- **Formulation**:\n  \\[\n  Q_t' = Q_t \\odot G_Q(W_t) \\\\\n  K_t' = K_t \\odot G_K(W_t)\n  \\]\n  where \\( Q_t \\) and \\( K_t \\) are produced via standard linear projections, and \\( \\odot \\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n- **Gating Networks**:\n  \\[\n  G_Q(W_t) = \\sigma(W_{GQ} W_t + b_{GQ}) \\\\\n  G_K(W_t) = \\sigma(W_{GK} W_t + b_{GK})\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid activation function, and \\( W_{GQ} \\), \\( W_{GK} \\), \\( b_{GQ} \\), \\( b_{GK} \\) are learnable parameters.\n\n**Mathematical Justification**:\nThe gating mechanisms enable the model to control the influence of queries and keys based on contextual relevance, thereby enhancing the expressiveness and focus of the attention mechanism without introducing additional computational complexity.\n\n#### 3. Implementing Uncertainty-Aware Compression\n\n**Objective**: Optimize memory usage by adaptively compressing hidden states based on the model's uncertainty, ensuring efficient scalability during long-context processing.\n\n**Implementation**:\n- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Integrate an uncertainty estimation module \\( U(W_t) \\) that gauges the confidence of the model's predictions.\n  \n- **Compression Function**:\n  \\[\n  W_t' = \\text{Compress}(W_t, U(W_t))\n  \\]\n  The compress function selectively reduces the dimensionality or scales down less certain components of the hidden state based on \\( U(W_t) \\).\n\n- **Formulation**:\n  \\[\n  W_t' = W_t \\odot \\text{sigmoid}(W_U U(W_t) + b_U)\n  \\]\n  where \\( W_U \\) and \\( b_U \\) are learnable parameters that control the extent of compression.\n\n**Mathematical Justification**:\nBy adapting compression strategies based on uncertainty, the model ensures that critical hidden state information is retained while less certain components are compressed, optimizing memory usage without sacrificing performance.\n\n### Mathematical Formulations and Theoretical Justifications\n\n1. **Meta-Learned Update Rule**:\n   \\[\n   W_t = M(W_{t-1}, x_t; \\theta_M)\n   \\]\n   where \\( M \\) is a meta-learner that determines the optimal update to the hidden state based on the current input and previous hidden state.\n\n2. **Gated Query and Key Generation**:\n   \\[\n   Q_t' = Q_t \\odot \\sigma(W_{GQ} W_t + b_{GQ}) \\\\\n   K_t' = K_t \\odot \\sigma(W_{GK} W_t + b_{GK})\n   \\]\n   Ensures that queries and keys are dynamically modulated based on the hidden state, enhancing attention mechanism's adaptability.\n\n3. **Uncertainty-Aware Compression**:\n   \\[\n   W_t' = W_t \\odot \\sigma(W_U U(W_t) + b_U)\n   \\]\n   Selectively compresses the hidden state by scaling less certain components, optimizing memory usage.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-Code for MetaTTT GAU\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass MetaTTT(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    MetaTTT: A Test-Time Training GAU enhanced with meta-learning, gated mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware compression.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, hidden_dim: int = 128, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        \n        # Meta-Learner for hidden state updates\n        self.meta_learner = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, hidden_dim, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n        \n        # Gated mechanisms for queries and keys\n        self.gate_q = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.gate_k = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Uncertainty estimation module\n        self.uncertainty_module = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, hidden_dim, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.Softplus(),\n            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n        \n        # Compression parameters\n        self.compress_gate = nn.Linear(1, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Initialize other GAU components (e.g., RotaryEmbedding, SwiGluMLP, Conv, RMSNorm)\n        # Assuming they are already initialized in the seed design\n        \n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # Meta-Learned Hidden State Update\n        W_prev = Z.get('hidden_state', torch.zeros(X.size(0), self.embed_dim, device=X.device, dtype=X.dtype))\n        W_new = self.meta_learner(W_prev, X)  # Assuming meta_learner takes W_prev and X as input\n        \n        # Gating for Queries and Keys\n        Q = self.q_proj(X)\n        K = self.k_proj(X)\n        G_Q = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_q(W_new))\n        G_K = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_k(W_new))\n        Q = Q * G_Q\n        K = K * G_K\n        \n        # Attention Mechanism (assuming existing attention implementation)\n        # Y, attn_weights = attention(Q, K, V)\n        # For simplicity, using a placeholder\n        Y = Q + K  # Placeholder for actual attention\n        \n        # Uncertainty Estimation\n        uncertainty = self.uncertainty_module(W_new)\n        compress_factor = torch.sigmoid(self.compress_gate(uncertainty))  # [Batch, Embed_dim]\n        \n        # Uncertainty-Aware Compression\n        W_compressed = W_new * compress_factor\n        \n        # Update Hidden State in Z\n        Z['hidden_state'] = W_compressed\n        \n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Replace Existing GAU**:\n   -
