However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

In this section, we organize these related works into (1) model-based or algorithmic contributions (appendix A.1) and (2) implementation or systems-based contributions (appendix A.2). ## A. 1 Efficient Language Modeling Architectures\n\nWhile Transformers often achieve state-of-the-art language modeling quality, their design motivates various efficiency improvements when both processing input sequences and generating outputs. In particular, various works try to retain their modeling quality, while improving on their quadratic scaling $\\left(\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)\\right.$ in input sequence length $N$ ) when processing inputs and $\\mathcal{O}(N M)$ time and space when decoding outputs for outputs of length $M$ (when caching prior keys and values in the attention mechanism). We note that most related lines of work build on one of two primitives: attention approximations (e.g., linear attentions, sparse attentions, sparse and low-rank attentions), or state-space models (SSMs) (which have alternative parameterizations as either \"long\" convolutional models or recurrent neueral networks). Both model classes achieve subquadratic time and space complexity when processing inputs, while linear attentions and SSMs also enable better than $\\mathcal{O}(N M)$ decoding via their ability to process inputs recurrently like a recurrent neural network (RNN). We describe each of these model classes next. ## A.1.1 Efficient Attentions\n\nWe focus on two of the most related paradigms for efficiently computing attention here, structured sparse attentions and linear attentions. We acknowledge a great deal of prior work to compute attention more efficiently, such as via locality-sensitive hashing [43, random sparse attentions [44, and sequence compression 45, 46, 47. Please see 48 for a comprehensive survey. Structured sparse attentions Structured parse attentions reduce attention's time and memory requirements by only attending over specific strided patterns or local sliding windows [17, 18, 19. For example, 17] propose computing attention only over a local window of the past $w$ tokens, such that processing sequences $N$ tokens long only takes $\\mathcal{O} N w$ time and space. [18] note that this window alone may not all capture all desired dependencies (such as long-term interactions), and propose two strided patterns to compute dot products between queries and keys further away. [19] further propose allowing specific tokens to attend to all other tokens in a dense manner. While further popularized in recent large language models (Mistral, Jiang et al. 10]), we note that these implementations use large window sizes that still leave room for improving efficiency. In Based, we introduce a hardware-guided design (using small windows) and sliding window implementation that allows us to capitalize on sparse attention's efficiency. Linear attentions Linear attentions preserve the same \"sequence-mixing\" operations as standard attention, computing dot products between queries and keys to weight corresponding values. However, their key insight is to replace the softmax in standard attention with alternative kernel functions [20]. Mechanically, by removing the $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}\\right)$ in favor of feature map dot-products $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q})^{\\top} \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, these methods use matrix product associativity to compute attention in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{2}\\right)$ time and space 24] (Equation 22). Furthermore, they permit a recurrent view for constant memory and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time per-token generation [25, 26] (Equation (3)). Prior works propose different feature maps $\\phi$ to improve linear attention modeling quality. 20 originally use the positive elu function $1+$ elu such that $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q})^{\\top} \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$ remains positive and attention weights remain affine. 23] instead use the ReLU function combined with a cosine-based reweighting function to add a locality bias. Other approaches propose feature maps that aim to approximate the Softmax, such as Random Fourier Features [21, 22] the Nystrom method 49, 50, or deterministic low-degree polynomial approximations [13, 14, 51]. Finally, recent works treat the feature map as a learnable function [25], and optionally train the feature map explicitly to recover the softmax kernel 13. Combining sparse and linear attentions Finally, another line of works similar in spirit to BASED combine sparse and linear attentions. Scatterbrain [52] use a sparse and low-rank decomposition to unify past sparse and low-rank approximations. They theoretically and empirically show that any low rank approximation of attention's $\\exp \\left(Q K^{T}\\right)$ will have a much larger approximation error than a sparse plus low rank approximation, echoed in our observations. TransNormer 53] apply normalizations such as LayerNorm 554 or RMSNorm 55] to linear attention outputs in certain layers, and apply softmax attention in local chunks in other layers. ## A.1.2 Attention Alternatives\n\nWe now review other attention alternatives, which focus on improving upon the quadratic scaling of attention. Initial work in this vein uses linear time invariant state space models (SSMs) or long convolutions, which can efficiently process sequences of length $N$ in $O(N \\log N)$ time invoking the FFT-convolution theorem [56, as the sequence mixer [4, 27, 31, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61. SSMs can also be rewritten as recurrences to permit fast $O(1)$ inference. Subsequent work identified that the long convolution alone is not expressive enough to perform particular sub-tasks in language modeling. Prior work shows pure linear SSMs cannot perform associative recall, a skill that is correlated with a model's in-context learning capability [3, 62, and introduces multiplicative interactions (via gating or Hadamard product [63]) between tokens to allow the model to compare tokens in the sequence [7, 8, 9]. However, Arora et al. 1] show empirically and theoretically the class of gated convolution architectures, any architectures built from the two gating and convolution primitives, struggles to learn associative recall (on synthetic and real language data) as efficiently as attention. They show that while attention solves AR in constant many layers / with model dimension that is independent of sequence length, any gated convolution architecture uses dimensionality that scales with the sequence length - we build upon their upper bound theoretical results with a lower bound argument in Section 3.2. We also study a broader set of architectures in this work beyond gated convolutions. Arora et al. [1], Gu and Dao [5], Yang et al. [6] identify that the use of input-dependent sequence mixers is important for an architecture to perform AR as efficiently as attention. AR requires shifting information that appears prior in a sequence to interact with the current (last) tokens in the sequence, in order to predict the next token [9. While gating is one way to introduce data-dependence [7], allowing comparing tokens in two (e.g. a shifted and unshifted) sequences, it is difficult to select which information from the prefix of the sequence to shift forwards in the first place, using gating alone. Intuitively, the information to shift depends on the input's properties. Thus, several subquadratic architectures consider alternate strategies to introduce input-dependence [5, 6, 24, 61, 64. We present another strategy for efficient input-dependent sequence mixing in our work. ## A. 2 Efficient Implementations\n\nBeyond designing new model architectures, various works introduce systems-level innovations to improve training and inference efficiency. These include alternative implementations of architecture primitives such as attention [11, 65, 66, long convolutions [31, 67], and linear attention [6, 20]. They frequently achieve both\nreduced memory and increased computational speed on modern GPUs by \"fusing\" operations such as matrix multiplications into a single CUDA kernel, and designing \"IO-aware\" ways to distribute and compute the results of various read and write operations between different levels of GPU memory. ## A.2.1 Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n$[12]$ introduce FlashAttention, an alternative yet exact implementation of softmax attention that improves memory and speed by both fusing attention operations into a single CUDA kernel and distributing the attention operations to better exploit High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). They first compute attention's query-key-value dot-products, masking, and softmax, together as a single kernel. By doing so after a single load to SRAM before moving the output back to HRAM, they exploit SRAM's fast compute and reduce the total number of read-write operations. To get around SRAM's small memory size and avoid attention's quadratic memory size over input sequence length, they use tiling to split up the query, key, and value inputs into smaller \"blocks\", compute the attention operations for each block, and adjust the outputs after computing all blocks to properly normalize the softmax 68, 69]. To perform backpropagation fast on SRAM, they get around SRAM's limited storage by recomputing the gradients rather than storing them. Despite the extra operations, this IO-aware implementation still significantly improves wall-clock time during training. Similarly making use of block-wise computation, 65 instead compute attention blocks across different devices in RingAttention, enabling training and inference over much larger context lengths that scale with device count. They distribute and compute the attention operations in each block across multiple hosts in parallel, likewise keeping track of summary statistics to gather results correctly into exact attention. However, they introduce an \"overlapping\" mechanism to coordinate communication of blocks to reduce overhead. They further make use of Blockwise Parallel Transformers 70 to reduce memory, which similar to FlashAttention removes the quadratic in memory scaling of attention by dividing the attention operation into separate blocks before gathering back the adjusted softmax output with block-wise normalization statistics. As a complement to attention training and inference, 66 improve attention generation with PagedAttention. PagedAttention similarly uses block-wise computation to address memory utilization issues during generation, where the KV cache can grow an undetermined amount. Existing systems may na\u00efvely handle this by preallocating large amounts of contiguous memory. However, this can result in low utilization and computational bottlenecks. Accordingly, PagedAttention divides attention's growing KV cache into KV blocks that can be stored separately on physical memory. This enables more flexible memory management, where smaller chunks can be allocated in different locations when needed to reduce memory-based bottlenecks. In Based, we use similar blocking strategies to more efficiently compute both the second-order Taylor series linear attention and the sliding window softmax attention, and for both training and inference. ## A.2.2 Efficient Attention-Alternative Implementations\n\nBeyond optimizations for attention, various works also introduce similar \"IO-aware\" implementations to improve memory usage and speed for convolutional and recurrent operations. We overview the most relevant works to Based, which make use of similar techniques such as fusing operations and blocking (tiling) to compute results in SRAM. Long convolutions 67] improve the efficiency of long convolutions on modern GPUs. They build on using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables computing convolutions with filter sizes equal to input sequence length from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ (if $N$ is filter size and sequence length) to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$. However, to compute this algorithm efficiently on GPUs, they break down the convolution into separate matrix multiply operations via a Monarch decomposition of the FFT, which allows both (1) fusing multiple steps of the FFT together (for reduced read-write operations) and (2) scheduling these operations for fast computation in SRAM while remaining under the smaller SRAM memory constraints. Recurrence [5 improve the efficiency of recent neural state-space models (SSMs) 27] using several similar techniques to FlashAttention, specifically with regard the recurrent view. They load the SSM parameters into SRAM for computation before saving results back in HBM, and also use recomputation where during\nbackpropagation the intermediate states are not saved but rather recomputed when inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. They finally improve wall-clock time by parallelizing the recurrent view of the SSM as a parallel scan. Linear Attention Finally, several works propose techniques to improve the real-world wall-clock time and memory-usage of linear attention. 20] fuse several operations in the causal dot product of linear attention. 6] use blocking to divide the linear attention matrices into SRAM-computable chunks in FlashLinearAttention. As a trade-off between the slow yet memory-efficient RNN view of linear attention and faster but memoryintensive parallel \"standard attention\" view, they further optimize a \"chunk-wise\" implementation of linear attention [71. When processing input sequences, the input is first divided into several non-overlapping chunks, where we save memory by computing \"kv states\" at the end of each chunk, and save time by computing the tokens in a given chunk in parallel. ## B IO Aware Implementations\n\nIn this section, we provide additional details pertaining to the benchmarking experiments and we provide microbenchmarking results for the individual kernels we contribute, to complement the end-to-end benchmarking results in the Section 6\n\n## B. 1 Forward / Generation Prefill\n\nBaselines In Figure 4 we implement Based using our IO-aware Taylor linear attention Algorithm 1 The baseline approach presented in 13, prior to our kernel, uses the popular linear attention CUDA kernel from Fast Transformers for computing the causal dot product 20, 34. ${ }^{5}$. The listing below shows the baseline implementation for reference (where line 76-77 can be computed using pure PyTorch or the Fast Transformers kernel). Micro Benchmark To complement the end-to-end architecture benchmarks in Section 6 we provide micro benchmark results for only the linear attention forward pass in Figure 5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-23.jpg?height=589&width=1539&top_left_y=949&top_left_x=289)\n\nFigure 5: Time (ms) for different ways of computing the Taylor linear attention forward pass - using Pure PyTorch (shown in the Listing and introduced in 13), Fast Transformers kernel (as indicated in the listing) [24, 34], or our BASEd kernel (Algorithm 1).

In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3 b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make Based competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable $24 \\times$ higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe choice of sequence mixer (e.g. attention, convolution) in a language model affects both its quality and efficiency [1, 2. Prior work shows that attention excels at recall, the ability to ground generations in previously seen tokens [1, 3]. On the other hand, the throughput of attention-based models is bottle-necked during training by quadratic compute complexity and during inference by aggressive memory consumption. The natural question is: can we improve the real-world speed and memory-use of language models without comprising on quality? Recently, a number of architectures have been proposed that enable substantially higher throughput while matching attention in perplexity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, coarse metrics like overall perplexity can obscure important differences in model quality. For example, recent work shows that a specific class of architectures, gated-convolutions, despite complexity scaling sub-quadratically in sequence length, are less efficient than\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-02.jpg?height=420&width=1620&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=247)\n\nFigure 1: Based overview. Combining linear attention with tiny sliding window softmax attention (e.g., 64 or 128 tokens in width) enables improved recall accuracy with limited efficiency overhead vs. smaller tile sizes. (Left) Time to execute Cutlass GEMMs $(y)$ vs. sliding window attention size $(x)$, with batch size 512 on tensor cores. (Center) Model recall accuracy ( $y$ ) vs. sliding window attention size $(x)$. We compare linear attention alone (dark blue), sliding window attention alone (light blue), and their combination (BASED, orange). (Right) Schematic diagram of BASED illustrating how the two components complement each other. attention at performing recall 1]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broader class of architectures across real-world recall-intensive tasks and show attention improves over the best attention-free alternative, Mamba, by 46.7 accuracy points (Table 1). ${ }^{1}$\n\nMotivated by these observations, we explore the pareto frontier of the tradeoff between high-recall and high-throughput models. We evaluate a range of architectures (e.g. attention, SSMs, and convolutions) on a popular synthetic associative recall task [1, 3, 9, Since generation throughput is bottle-necked by memory consumption, we vary hyperparameters (e.g. model dimension) that affect the size of the recurrent state during generation and demonstrate a fundamental recall-memory tradeoff that holds across architecture classes (Figure 2). Attention performs associative recall perfectly, but the recurrent state (i.e. the KV-cache) grows linearly with the sequence length. Sliding window attention can cap the size of the recurrent state at the cost of worse long-range recall 10 . However, Mamba, a recently proposed SSM architecture expands the Pareto frontier beyond sliding window. This begs the question: are there other, perhaps simpler, models that can also expand the pareto frontier? To reduce the memory consumption, we consider using two simple techniques: sliding window attention and softmax-approximating linear attention. Our results on language modeling (Table 1) and synthetic recall experiments (Figure 1, center) suggest neither primitive alone suffices to navigate the Pareto frontier. 1. We find that linear attention alone struggles to solve associative recall (Figure 1, center). We hypothesize that this is because linear attention lacks the precision to perform local token shifts and comparisons [1, 9. 2. In sliding window attention, associative recall range is limited by the width of the windows (Figure 1, center). As we increase the window size, the recurrent state grows linearly and has a non-linear affect on speed during parallel training and inference (Figure 1 , left). We combine these two techniques into a single architecture, which we call BASED (Figure 1, right). We find that sliding window attention and linear attention complement each other, enabling BASED to expand the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff (Figure 22. We suspect that (1) the large recurrent memory of linear attention could help model long-range token interactions in the sequence and (2) sliding window attention handles the precise local shifts needed to perform associative recall. To make BASED competitive with SoTA attention 11] and recurrent [5 models under wall-clock and throughput metrics, we introduce several IO-aware optimizations. 1. Despite the theoretically improved complexity, linear attention implementations are often slower than well-optimized attention implementations 12 . In BASED, we use the 2nd-order Taylor approximation of softmax as the linear attention feature map With sequence length $N$ and head dimension $d$, this\n\n[^1]na\u00efvely requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity [13, 14].\n```\n\n#### 2.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly.

(LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1.

It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

The benefits of linear attention largely depend on its decay mechanism [1-3], which prevents attention dilution [4] and facilitates global interaction among tokens. However, the decay mechanism presents two primary issues: First, the decay mechanism is not easily applicable to high-dimensional inputs due to the need for multiple sequential scans to establish a global multi-dimensional receptive field, which reduces computational efficiency [5, 6]. Additionally, without the decay mechanism, linear attention lacks positional awareness during computations, leading to decreased performance [4]. In light of these challenges, we are investigating the feasibility of reducing sequential scans for multi-dimensional scenarios while preserving performance. We first analyze the types of linear recurrence and divide them into two categories: multiplicative and additive. In multiplicative recurrence, the decay rate is dependent only on the current moment, making it impossible to obtain information about subsequent moments with a single scan. By taking image processing as an example, using multiplicative recurrence will require at least two scans to retrieve the global information [5, 6]. Conversely, in additive recurrence, the decay rate depends on\n\n[^0]all moments through the summation of the importance score of each moment, enabling it to gather global information in a single scan. It is important to note that in non-causal situations, additive recurrence is permutation-invariant, which means it lacks local precedence and therefore diminishes the capture of positional information. To overcome this limitation, we put forth a new approach to positional encoding called Multi-Dimensional Toeplitz Positional Encoding (MD-TPE). This method utilizes the mathematical properties of the Toeplitz matrix to embed relative positional information with linear time complexity, thus ensuring efficiency in multi-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, we expand the Linearized Relative Positional Encoding (LRPE) [7] to high-dimensional scenarios, resulting in the creation of Multi-Dimensional Linearized Relative Positional Encoding (MD-LRPE). We then present LightNet, a new multi-dimensional linear attention model built on additive recurrence. LightNet features a pioneering decay mechanism, allowing for efficient single-scan processing of high-dimensional sequential data. Furthermore, it integrates highly effective multi-dimensional position encoding such as MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to precisely capture positional information. We conduct several evaluations of the performance of our proposed LightNet on a range of tasks, including image generation, image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling. LightNet performs comparably or better than its competitors across all tasks. We summarize our main contributions as follows:\n\n- We analyze the types of linear recurrence, dividing them into two types: multiplicative and additive, where the additive type can obtain global information in a single scan. - We propose two multi-dimensional position encoding strategies, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE, to effectively capture positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. - We propose LightNet, a new multi-dimensional linear attention model that can process high-dimensional sequences in a single scan. - We conduct thorough evaluations to assess the efficiency and efficacy of LightNet for multidimensional sequential modeling tasks. The LightNet demonstrates competitive performance in all scenarios. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLinear Attention. The linear attention mechanism has greatly advanced deep learning, particularly in natural language processing, by providing a scalable solution for long input sequences and reducing the computational demands of traditional attention models [8-11]. However, despite its faster training speeds, linear attention's performance still falls short of softmax attention due to the attention dilution issue [4]. The TNL/RetNet [2, 4] introduces a decay mechanism to address this problem. Additionally, GLA [12] incorporating gating mechanisms show the potential to enhance linear attention models. State Space Model. State Space Models (SSMs) are increasingly crucial in sequence modeling due to their structured approach to capturing temporal dynamics through latent variables. The S4 model [13] enhances state space modeling for long sequences by leveraging structured spaces to improve computational efficiency and tackle complex dynamics. With additional parameterizing and initializing diagonal state space strategy [14], the SSMs can achieve comparable performance to naive transformers. Furthermore, the Gated State Space (GSS) model [15] introduces a gating mechanism to SSMs, which is particularly effective for long-range language modeling by allowing nuanced control over information flow. The S5 model [16] reduces complexity using \"scan\" while maintaining the capability to handle intricate sequences. However, directly extending the SSM to multi-dimensional input usually requires multiple sequential scans, which will reduce the computational efficiency [6]. Linear RNN. Linear RNNs employ element-wise recursion for sequence modeling, and due to their linear recursive form, they can be accelerated using parallel scans [17]. At their core is the decay mechanism, where RWKV-4/LRU [1, 18] utilizes data-independent decay. HGRN [19, 20] leverage data-dependent decay to enhance performance. Linear RNNs have shown considerable potential in language modeling and long-sequence modeling tasks. Multi-dimensional Tasks with Linear Complexity Model. The development of linear attention in language models has led to its extension into multi-dimensional tasks. Building upon the cosFormer framework [10], VVT [21] explores a local prior of 2D linear attention and applies it to image classification tasks.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA).

Introduction\n\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the new engine of state-of-the-art deep learning systems, leading to many recent breakthroughs in language (Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020) and vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Although they have been growing in model size, most Transformers are still limited to short context size due to their quadratic complexity over the input length. This limitation prevents Transformer models from processing long-term information, a critical property for many applications. Many techniques have been proposed to speedup Transformers over extended context via more efficient attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2019; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). Despite the linear theoretical complexity for some of those methods, vanilla Transformers still remain as the dominant choice in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-01.jpg?height=589&width=763&top_left_y=622&top_left_x=1104)\n\nFigure 1: TPU-v4 training speedup of FLASH relative to the vanilla Transformer (TFM) and an augmented Transformer (TFM++) for auto-regressive language modeling on Wiki40B - All models are comparable in size at around 110M and trained for 125 K steps with $2^{18}$ tokens per batch. state-of-the-art systems. Here we examine this issue from a practical perspective, and find existing efficient attention methods suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks:\n\n- Inferior Quality. Our studies reveal that vanilla Transformers, when augmented with several simple tweaks, can be much stronger than the common baselines used in the literature (see Transformer vs. Transformer++ in Figure 1). Existing efficient attention methods often incur significant quality drop compared to augmented Transformers, and this drop outweighs their efficiency benefits. - Overhead in Practice. As efficient attention methods often complicate Transformer layers and require extensive memory re-formatting operations, there can be a nontrivial gap between their theoretical complexity and empirical speed on accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs. - Inefficient Auto-regressive Training. Most attention linearization techniques enjoy fast decoding during inference, but can be extremely slow to train on auto-regressive tasks such as language modeling. This is primarily due to their RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps, making it infeasible to fully leverage the strength of modern accelerators during training.

Skip connection and input normalization over the residual branch are omitted in (a), (b) for brevity. We address the above issues by developing a new model family that, for the first time, not only achieves parity with fully augmented Transformers in quality, but also truly enjoys linear scalability over the context size on modern accelerators. Unlike existing efficient attention methods which directly aim to approximate the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in Transformers, we start with a new layer design which naturally enables higher-quality approximation. Specifically, our model, named FLASH, is developed in two steps:\n\nFirst, we propose a new layer that is more desirable for effective approximation. We introduce a gating mechanism to alleviate the burden of self-attention, resulting in the Gated Attention Unit (GAU) in Figure 2. As compared to Transformer layers, each GAU layer is cheaper, and more importantly, its quality relies less on the precision of attention. In fact, GAU with a small single-head, softmax-free attention is as performant as Transformers. While GAU still suffers from quadratic complexity over the context size, it weakens the role of attention hence allows us to carry out approximation later with minimal quality loss. We then propose an efficient method to approximate the quadratic attention in GAU, leading to a layer variant with linear complexity over the context size. The key idea is to first group tokens into chunks, then using precise quadratic attention within a chunk and fast linear attention across chunks, as illustrated in Figure 4. We further describe how an accelerator-efficient implementation can be naturally derived from this formulation, achieving linear scalability in practice with only a few lines of code change. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of FLASH over a variety of tasks (masked and autoregressive language modeling), datasets (C4, Wiki-40B, PG19) and model scales (110M to 500M). Remarkably, FLASH is competitive with fully-augmented Transformers (Transformer++) in quality across a wide range of context sizes of practical interest (512-8K), while achieving linear scalability on modern hardware accelerators. For example, with comparable quality, FLASH achieves a speedup of $1.2 \\times-$ $4.9 \\times$ for language modeling on Wiki-40B and a speedup of $1.0 \\times-4.8 \\times$ for masked language modeling on C 4 over Transformer++. As we further scale up to PG-19 (Rae et al., 2019), FLASH reduces the training cost of Transformer++ by up to $12.1 \\times$ and achieves significant gain in quality. ## 2. Gated Attention Unit\n\nHere we present Gated Attention Unit (GAU), a simpler yet more performant layer than Transformers. While GAU still has quadratic complexity over the context length, it is more desirable for the approximation method to be presented in Section 3. We start with introducing related layers:\n\nVanilla MLP. Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}$ be the representations over $T$ tokens. The output for Transformer's MLP can be formulated as $O=\\phi\\left(X W_{u}\\right) W_{o}$ where $W_{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times e}, W_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{e \\times d}$. Here $d$ denotes the model size, $e$ denotes the expanded intermediate size, and $\\phi$ is an element-wise activation function. Gated Linear Unit (GLU). This is an improved MLP augmented with gating (Dauphin et al., 2017). GLU has been proven effective in many cases (Shazeer, 2020; Narang et al., 2021) and is used in state-of-the-art Transformer language models (Du et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& U=\\phi_{u}\\left(X W_{u}\\right), \\quad V=\\phi_{v}\\left(X W_{v}\\right) \\quad \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times e} \\\\\n& O=(U \\odot V) W_{o} \\quad \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ stands for element-wise multiplication. In GLU, each representation $u_{i}$ is gated by another representation $v_{i}$ associated with the same token. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-03.jpg?height=485&width=1567&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=256)\n\nFigure 3: GAU vs. Transformers for auto-regressive and masked language modeling on short context length (512). Gated Attention Unit (GAU). The key idea is to formulate attention and GLU as a unified layer and to share their computation as much as possible (Figure 2). This not only results in higher param/compute efficiency, but also naturally enables a powerful attentive gating mechanism. Specifically, GAU generalizes Eq. (2) in GLU as follows:\n\n$$\nO=(U \\odot \\hat{V}) W_{o} \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\hat{V}=A V\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ contains token-token attention weights. Unlike GLU which always uses $v_{i}$ to gate $u_{i}$ (both associated with the same token), our GAU replaces $v_{i}$ with a potentially more relevant representation $\\hat{v}_{i}=\\sum_{j} a_{i j} v_{j}$ \"retrieved\" from all available tokens using attention. The above will reduce to GLU when $A$ is an identity matrix. Consistent with the findings in Liu et al. (2021), the presence of gating allows the use of a much simpler/weaker attention mechanism than MHSA without quality loss:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nZ=\\phi_{z}\\left(X W_{z}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times s} \\\\\nA=\\operatorname{relu}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{Q}(Z) \\mathcal{K}(Z)^{\\top}+b\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n| Modifications | PPLX (LM/MLM) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| original GAU | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 7 8 / 4 . 2 3}$ | 105 |\n| relu $^{2} \\rightarrow$ softmax | $17.04 / 4.31$ | 105 |\n| single-head $\\rightarrow$ multi-head | $17.76 / 4.48$ | 105 |\n| no gating | $17.45 / 4.58$ | 131 |\n\nTable 1: Impact of various modifications on GAU. where $Z$ is a shared representation $(s \\ll d)^{4}, \\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are two cheap transformations that apply per-dim scalars and offsets to $Z$ (similar to the learnable variables in LayerNorms), and $b$ is the relative position bias. We also find the softmax in MHSA can be simplified as a regular activation function in the case of $\\mathrm{GAU}^{5}$. The GAU layer and its\n\n[^2]| Modifications | PPLX (LM/MLM) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| original MHSA | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 8 7} / \\mathbf{4 . 3 5}$ | 110 |\n| softmax $\\rightarrow$ relu $^{2}$ | $17.15 / 4.77$ | 110 |\n| multi-head $\\rightarrow$ single-head | $17.89 / 4.73$ | 110 |\n| add gating | $17.25 / 4.43$ | 106 |\n\nTable 2: Impact of various modifications on MHSA. pseudocode are illustrated in Figure 2. Unlike Transformer's MHSA which comes with $4 d^{2}$ parameters, GAU's attention introduces only a single small dense matrix $W_{z}$ with $d s$ parameters on top of GLU (scalars and offsets in $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are negligible). By setting $e=2 d$ for GAU, this compact design allows us to replace each Transformer block (MLP/GLU + MHSA) with two GAUs while retaining similar model size and training speed. GAU vs. Transformers. Figure 3 shows that GAUs are competitive with Transformers (MSHA + MLP/GLU) on TPUs across different models sizes. Note these experiments are conducted over a relatively short context size (512). We will see later in Section 4 that GAUs are in fact even more performant when the context length is longer, thanks to their reduced capacity in attention. Layer Ablations. In Table $1 \\& 2$ we show that both GAUs and Transformers are locally optimal on their own. ## 3. Fast Linear Attention with GAU\n\nThere are two observations from Section 2 that motivate us to extend GAU to modeling long sequences:\n\n- First, the gating mechanism in GAU allows the use of a weaker (single-headed, softmax-free) attention without quality loss. If we further adapt this intuition into modeling long sequences with attention, GAU could also boost the effectiveness of approximate (weak) attention mechanisms such as local, sparse and linearized attention. - In addition, the number of attention modules is naturally doubled with GAU - recall MLP+MHSA $\\approx 2 \\times$ GAU in terms of cost (Section 2). Since approximate attention usually requires more layers to capture full dependency (Dai et al., 2019; Child et al., 2019), this property also makes GAU more appealing in handling long sequences. With this intuition in mind, we start by reviewing some related work on modeling long sequences with attention, and then show how we enable GAU to achieve Transformerlevel quality in linear time on long sequences. ### 3.1. Existing Linear-Complexity Variants\n\nPartial Attention. A popular class of methods tries to approximate the full attention matrix with different partial/sparse patterns, including local window (Dai et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2019), local+sparse (Child et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020), axial (Ho et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019), learnable patterns through hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020) or clustering (Roy et al., 2021). Though not as effective as full attention, these variants are usually able to enjoy quality gains from scaling to longer sequences. However, the key problem with this class of methods is that they involve extensive irregular or regular memory re-formatting operations such as gather, scatter, slice and concatenation, which are not friendly to modern accelerators of massive parallelism, particularly specialized ASICs like TPU. As a result, their practical benefits (speed and RAM efficiency), if any, largely depend on the choice of accelerator and usually fall behind the theoretical analysis. Hence, in this work, we deliberately minimize the number of memory re-formatting operations in our model. Linear Attention. Alternatively, another popular line of research linearizes the attention computation by decomposing the attention matrix and then re-arranging the order of matrix multiplications (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). Schematically, the linear attention can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}_{\\text {lin }}=Q \\underbrace{\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)}_{\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}} \\xrightarrow{\\text { approx }} \\hat{V}_{\\text {quad }}=\\operatorname{Softmax} \\underbrace{\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)}_{\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}} V\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}$ are the query, key and value representations, respectively. Re-arranging the computation reduces the complexity w.r.t $T$ from quadratic to linear. Another desirable property of linear attention is its constant ${ }^{6}$ computation and memory for each auto-regressive decoding step at inference time. To see that, define $M_{t}=K_{: t}^{\\top} V_{: t}$ and notice that the computation of $M_{t}$ can be fully incremental:\n\n$$\nM_{t}=M_{t-1}+K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}\n$$\n\n[^3]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-04.jpg?height=758&width=817&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=1055)\n\nFigure 4: (top) Quadratic attention, (mid) Linear attention, (bottom) Proposed mixed chunk attention with a chunk size $(C)$ of 2 ( $C$ is always greater than or equal to 128 in our experiments). Our method significantly reduces the compute in quadratic attention (red links), while requiring substantially less RNN-style steps (green squares) in conventional linear attention. This means we only need to maintain a cache with constant $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ memory and whenever a new input arrives at time stamp $t$, only constant $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ computation is required to accumulate $K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}$ into $M_{t-1}$ and get $M_{t}$. On the contrary, full quadratic attention requires linear $\\mathcal{O}(T d)$ computation and memory for each decoding step, as each new input has to attend to all the previous steps. However, on the other hand, re-arranging the computation in linear attention leads to a severe inefficiency during autoregressive training. As shown in Fig. 4 (mid), due to the causal constraint for auto-regressive training, the query vector at each time step $Q_{t}$ corresponds to a different cache value $M_{t}=K_{: t}^{\\top} V_{: t}$. This requires the model to compute and cache $T$ different values $\\left\\{M_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ instead of only one value $K^{\\top} V$ in the non-autoregressive case. In theory, the sequence $\\left\\{M_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ can be obtained in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T d^{2}\\right)$ by first computing $\\left\\{K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ and then performing a large cumulative sum (cumsum) over $T$ tokens. But in practice, the cumsum introduces an RNN-style sequential dependency of $T$ steps, where an $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ state needs to be processed each step. The sequential dependency not only limits the degree of parallelism, but more importantly requires $T$ memory access in the loop, which usually costs much more time than computing the element-wise addition on modern accelerators. As a result, there exists a considerable gap between the theoretical complexity and actual running time. In practice, we find that directly computing the full quadratic attention matrix is\neven faster than the re-arranged (linearized) version on both TPUs (Figure 6(a)) and GPUs (Appendix C.1). ### 3.2. Our Method: Mixed Chunk Attention\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of existing linearcomplexity attentions, we propose mixed chunk attention, which merges the benefits from both partial attention and linear attention. The high-level idea is illustrated in Figure 4. Below we reformulate GAU to incorporate this idea. Preparation. The input sequence is first chunked into $G$ non-overlapping chunks of size $C$, i.e. $[T] \\rightarrow[T / C \\times$ $C]$. Then, $U_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times e}, V_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times e}$ and $Z_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times s}$ are produced for each chunk $g$ following the GAU formulation in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/51 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n# Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training \n\nSonglin Yang ${ }^{1 *}$ Bailin Wang ${ }^{1 *}$ Yikang Shen ${ }^{2}$ Rameswar Panda ${ }^{2}$ Yoon Kim ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form. GLA has a 2D forget gate $\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\in(0,1)^{d_{k} \\times d_{v}}$ that varies over time:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere we now allow the hidden state to have varying dimensions. This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1. Central to the design of gated linear attention is the parameterization of $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ which requires a balance between parameter-efficiency, state size, and training efficiency.

However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Michael Poli, Armin W.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba.

Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan, Yuan-Fang Li, Yuxuan Liang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaoming Shi, James Y. Zhang, Zhixuan Chu, Lintao Ma, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. LiDAR4D: Dynamic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Changjun Jiang, Guang Chen, Weiyi Xue, Fan Lu, Zehan Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS), LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction.

MaxQ: Multi-Axis Query for N:M Sparsity Network\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Yong liu, Linpeng Peng, Tianxin Huang, Zhuangzhi Chen, JunHao Chen, Siqi Li, Jingyang Xiang*\n\n**Abstract:** N:M sparsity has received increasing attention due to its remarkable performance and latency trade-off compared with structured and unstructured sparsity. However, existing N:M sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides, they directly apply N:M sparsity to the whole network, which will cause severe information loss. Thus, they are still sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology, dubbed as MaxQ, to rectify these problems. During the training, MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:M masks, considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile, a sparsity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:M weight blocks is applied, which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime, the N:M soft masks can be precomputed as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring additional computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improvements across diverse CNN architectures in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern, MaxQ can achieve 74.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8\\% over the state-of-the-art.

This involves adapting the sparsity of the attention matrix based on the input data, which can reduce computational complexity and memory usage. While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss dynamic sparsity patterns, the concept is closely related to optimizing attention mechanisms. For instance, models like Lightning Attention-2 and BASED, though not explicitly mentioned in the sources, are known to benefit from such optimizations.\n\n## Gated Attention Units\n- The introduction of gated attention units can control the flow of information and enhance the model's adaptability. The paper on AGaLiTe (Approximate Gated Linear Transformers) is particularly relevant here. It describes a gated structure that allows the model to uncover relationships far in the past and control the flow of past information through a learned decay mechanism. This gating mechanism can be integrated into linear attention to improve efficiency and performance.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n- Linear attention mechanisms, such as those described in AGaLiTe, offer significant computational efficiency improvements by reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. This makes them suitable for handling long sequences in language models. The AGaLiTe model introduces a parameterized feature map and a gating mechanism, which can be adapted to enhance the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n\n## Integration with Other Techniques\n- Combining linear attention with techniques like sliding window attention and dynamic sparsity patterns can further optimize efficiency. The concept of using sliding window attention, as seen in models like BASED, can be integrated with dynamic sparsity to create a more efficient and scalable model. Additionally, incorporating IO-aware algorithms and hardware-friendly designs, as in Lightning Attention-2, can help realize the theoretical benefits of linear attention in practice.\n\n## Empirical Validation\n- Conducting empirical validation is crucial to assess the impact of proposed modifications on model performance and efficiency. This involves comparing the modified models with existing state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, and training and inference efficiency. The paper on Dynamic Temporal Denoise Neural Network with Multi-Head Attention provides a framework for evaluating such models, including metrics and ablation analysis, which can be adapted for language models.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- **Gated Mechanisms**: Implementing gated attention units, as in AGaLiTe, can control the flow of information and enhance model performance and adaptability.\n- **Dynamic Sparsity**: Incorporating dynamic sparsity patterns can reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency, although this would require further research and implementation.\n- **Linear Attention**: Leveraging linear attention mechanisms can significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage, making them ideal for efficient language modeling.\n- **Empirical Evaluation**: Conduct thorough empirical evaluations to validate the performance and efficiency of the modified models.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and adaptive autoregressive language models that outperform existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives.

Additional architecture details are provided in (Appendix B). Mixture of Sequence Experts We further introduce to our MAD analysis a layer inspired by sparsely gated channel mixers, the Hyena experts layer. In a Hyena experts layer with $E$ experts and $K$ active experts, a router selects from a set of smaller Hyena mixers, using a router $G(u): u \\mapsto s$ from input sequence $u \\in R^{T \\times D}$ to scores $s \\in R^{T \\times K}$, defined as\n\n$$\ns_{t}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\operatorname{top}_{K}\\left(u_{t} \\mathrm{~W}_{g}\\right)\\right), \\quad \\mathrm{W}_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times E}, \\quad t=1, \\ldots, L\n$$\n\nresulting in\n\n$$\n\\text { HyenaExperts }(u)_{t}=\\sum_{k^{\\prime}=1}^{k} s_{t k^{\\prime}} \\text { Hyena }(u)_{t k^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nAn advantage of the Hyena experts layer is that only a subset of the total state dimension is used to compose the output at each time step. We note that sparsely gated recurrences have also been explored for recurrences in [32], and that other similar schemes for sparse gating at the state level are also possible using input-varying recurrent primitives. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_46d2059d3f5ccf0ee670g-08.jpg?height=766&width=1545&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=240)\n\nFigure 3.7: MAD analysis: An extensive evaluation of a suite of model architectures, built from common sequence- and channel-mixing layer types, across six synthetic tasks, each designed to probe a specific skill relevant for sequence modeling at scale. ### 3.4 Results\n\nWe test a suite of architectures in the MAD protocol. In addition to ranking overall model performances across the synthetic tasks (Fig. 3.7), we take a high-level view on general patterns in model performances related to their design, including the presence of specific computational primitives in an architecture and the architecture's topology. We indicate a model's performance by its accuracy in correctly predicting tokens in the synthetic tasks. Note that model performances in MAD can likewise be measured through their evaluation loss (see Appendix B.1). Both performance metrics yield similar model rankings. Hybridization to combine specialized layers Inspecting the performance on individual tasks via a stratified analysis (Appendix B.5) reveals specialization of architectures built with a single type of primitive, such as Mamba excelling at compression and Hyena at fuzzy recall. Finding 1: Striped architectures outperform all non-striped architectures on composite metrics, with an average gain in accuracy of $8.1 \\%$ across the MAD synthetic tasks (Fig. 3.7). We further find MAD performance to increases with models' total fixed state dimension, underscoring the importance of normalizing state dimensions when comparing model capabilities, further motivating a state-optimal scaling law analysis (Fig. 4.3). Head expansion trick It is beneficial to arrange the fixed state dimension into larger heads with fewer states instead of smaller heads with additional states (in the limit case, in a mSISO configuration). Finding 2: Architectures that expand their total state dimension through heads (see Sec. 2.2) outperform architectures without heads, with an average gain of $2.3 \\%$ in accuracy across the MAD synthetic tasks (Fig. 3.7). We note that the head expansion trick also linearly increases the computation in the layer, and for this reason it introduces a trade-off between compute-optimality and state-optimality. In Sec. 4, we will explore the trade-offs of this state configuration by comparing compute-optimal and state-optimal scaling of models with and without heads. Sparse layers We find sparsely gated layers to outperform dense layers in MAD synthetics, in line with the literature on mixture of experts and their benefits. Finding 3: MAD performance improves with the addition of sparsely activated mixture of expert channel-mixing layers, when compared to architectures using SwiGLU channel mixers, with an average gain in accuracy of $1.7 \\%$ across tasks (Fig. 3.7). In our later analyses, we will connect the performance of architectures on MAD to their performance at scale on The Pile [33] (Fig. 5.1). Additional MAD analysis results are provided in Appendix B.5. ## 4 Scaling Analysis\n\nWe seek to verify the connection between mechanistic design tasks and performance at scale. For this reason, we execute an extensive scaling law analysis on language pretraining, expanding on the framework of [1, 2]. We train more than 500 models of different architectures on The Pile [33]. Let $\\mathcal{M}_{w, \\xi}$ be a model with parameters $w$ and architecture $\\xi$. Denote with $N=|w|$ the number of parameters, with $D$ the total number of training tokens, and the training cost (in floating point operations, FLOPS) with $c_{\\xi}(N, D)$. Let $\\mathcal{A}_{\\xi}(C)$ be the set of tuples $(N, D)$ such that the training cost is exactly $C$, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\xi}(C):=\\left\\{(N, D) \\mid c_{\\xi}(N, D)=C\\right\\}$. Given a tuple $(N, D) \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\xi}(C)$ one can evaluate $\\mathcal{L}_{\\xi}(N, D)$, the loss achievable for that combination of parameters/tokens. A point $(C, \\ell(C))$ in the locus of the compute-optimal frontier in the loss-compute plane is defined as\n\n$$\n(C, \\ell(C)): \\ell(C)=\\min _{(N, D) \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\xi}(C)} \\mathcal{L}_{\\xi}(N, D)\n$$\n\nwith $\\ell(C)$ indicating the best loss achievable by training $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta, \\xi}$ at compute budget $C$, optimizing the allocation of compute to model size $N$ and training tokens $D$, for architecture $\\xi$. Relatedly, one may seek the functional form of the compute-optimal frontier in the parameter-compute or token-compute planes, composed of tuples $\\left(C, N^{*}\\right)$ and $\\left(C, D^{*}\\right)$, where $D^{*}, N^{*}$ represent the optimal i.e., achieving lowest loss, allocation subject to the $\\left(N^{*}, D^{*}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\xi}(\\mathcal{C})$ constraint. A primary objective of scaling law analyses is to determine such optimal allocation of the computational budget. To estimate efficient frontiers, we use an IsoFLOP approach, which explores different allocation ratios of model parameters and number of tokens at each compute budget. The loss optimum is then estimated via a quadratic fit (see Fig 4.2 as an example). ### 4.1 Compute-optimal frontier for new architectures\n\nOur first set of findings is related to the efficient frontier of the baseline Transformer++ [4] in relation to other architectures. [2] finds that when $\\xi$ is a standard Transformer architecture (combining attention and MLP), the optimal ratios between the number or model parameters, training tokens, and compute budget, are explained by a linear relationship in $\\log$-log space, i.e., $\\log N^{*} \\propto a \\log C$ and $\\log D^{*} \\propto b \\log C$. Finding 5: Let $a_{\\mathrm{H}}, a_{\\mathrm{T}}, b_{\\mathrm{H}}, b_{\\mathrm{T}}$ be the parameter size and data allocation coefficients for striped and Transformer models, respectively. We estimate $a_{\\mathrm{T}}>a_{H}$ and $b_{\\mathrm{T}}<b_{H}$ (Fig. 4.1). Optimal allocation of tokens and parameters is relatively stable under striping, with marginal differences. One notable difference is that optimal compute allocation in emerging efficient architectures is skewed towards additional data i.e., training smaller models for longer. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_46d2059d3f5ccf0ee670g-09.jpg?height=568&width=1676&top_left_y=1944&top_left_x=235)\n\nFigure 4.1: Compute optimal scaling. [Top:] For each architecture, we train models of different sizes for a constant number of FLOPs (so-called IsoFLOP groups). For each of these IsoFLOP groups, we determine an optimum model size based on a polynomial fit to the observed training perplexities. [Bottom:] Using these estimates, we predict optimal model sizes and number of training tokens for each architecture. Beyond the efficient frontier Next, we look at optimality gaps when training outside the efficient frontier. By optimality gap, we refer to the increase in loss by training outside the compute-optimal frontier i.e., $\\mathcal{L}(C(\\tilde{N}, \\tilde{D}, \\xi))$ where $\\tilde{N}=N^{*}+\\delta N^{*}$ and the number of tokens $\\tilde{D}$ is adjusted to preserve the total compute cost. Finding 6: The off compute-optimal perplexity gap is proportional to the hybridization ratio (Fig.4.2), for all IsoFLOP groups. Intuitively, models with \"flatter\" IsoFLOP perplexity curves are preferred for overtraining smaller models, a setting particularly common in practice, as it results in smaller models with faster inference. Interestingly, the suboptimality gap in hybrids is smaller than Transformers, meaning they are better suited to training outside the optimal frontier. Striping schedule and topology We study compute-optimal ratio and allocation of attention operators in striped architectures, as well as their overall topology (Fig. D.1). Finding 7: The compute-optimal hybridization ratio for striped models is $25 \\%$ across all IsoFLOP groups ${ }^{8}$ (Fig.4.2 and Table D.1). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_46d2059d3f5ccf0ee670g-10.jpg?height=374&width=1595&top_left_y=1023&top_left_x=237)\n\nFigure 4.2: Optimal striping ratio. We find that StripedHyena architectures outperform non-striped Hyena ( $0 \\%$ Attention) and Transformer++ ( $100 \\%$ Attention) architectures across all evaluated FLOPS groups. In particular, we find a ratio of $25 \\%$ to be optimal. Batch sizes and hyperparameters Batch size and learning rate are two high-impact hyperparameters for scaling laws, as they visibly shift the compute-efficient frontier. We find that scaling the batch size with FLOP budgets, thus keeping it fixed within each IsoFLOP group, to be a simple and robust approach.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mixture of A Million Experts (Avg.

Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nSparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost.

Here we conduct an ablation study on the effect of the number of experts $N$, which determines the total parameter count $P$ in Eq. 9 . We selected the model at the isoFLOP-optimal position and vary the number of experts $\\left(N=128^{2}, 256^{2}, 512^{2}, 1024^{2}\\right)$ in the PEER layer while keeping the number of active experts constant $(h=8, k=16)$. The results are shown in Fig. 3 (a). As can be seen, the isoFLOP curve interpolates between the PEER model with $1024^{2}$ experts and the corresponding dense backbone without replacing the FFW layer in the middle block by a PEER layer. This demonstrates that simply increasing the number experts can improve model performance. Varying the Number of Active Experts We also conducted an ablation study on the effect of the number of active experts $h k$, which equals the granularity $G$ in Eq. 9. We systematically varied the number of\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-07.jpg?height=852&width=1656&top_left_y=289&top_left_x=240)\n\nFigure 3: We conduct two ablation studies using the same PEER model configuration. In (a), we vary the total number of experts $N$ while keeping the same number of active experts $h k=128$. In (b), we vary the number of active experts $G=h k$ by jointly changing $h$ and $k$ while keeping the total number of experts at $N=1024^{2}$. active experts $(h k=32,64,128,256,512)$ while keeping the number of total experts constant $\\left(N=1024^{2}\\right)$. Furthermore, for a given $h k$, we jointly varied $h$ and $k$ to identify the optimal composition. The resulting isoFLOP curves, plotted over the number of heads $(h)$, are shown in Fig. 3(b). The results indicate that, within the range of values considered, higher $h k$ generally leads to improved performance. Notably, the optimal $h$ increases as $h k$ increases. However, the performance gradually saturates, and increasing the number of active experts also increases device memory consumption and may necessitate additional accelerator devices. Thus in practice, the appropriate $h k$ values should be selected based on the trade-off between performance, device number and computational resource requirements. Table 2: KL and expert usage for different memory sizes, with and without query BN. Similar to the findings in PKM, using query BN results in a more balanced usage of the experts. | Expert num $N$ | 16 k |  | 65 k |  | 262 k |  | 1 M |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| BatchNorm | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Perplexity | 23.47 | 23.47 | 22.61 | 22.55 | 21.54 | 21.47 | 20.73 | 20.64 |\n| Expert Usage (\\%) | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 99.8 | 100.0 |\n| Unevenness ( $\\downarrow$ ) | 0.45 | 0.30 | 0.63 | 0.44 | 0.97 | 0.66 | 1.52 | 1.06 |\n\nExpert Usage and Query Batch Normalization Given the presence of over a million experts in the PEER layer, it is natural to inquire how many of these experts are actually selected during inference and whether their usage is evenly distributed. To analyze this, we kept an accumulated router score, denoted as $z_{i}^{\\prime}=$ $\\sum_{x} g_{i}(x)$ for each expert $e_{i}$ across all tokens $x$ within the C 4 validation set. Here $g_{i}(x)$ is the router score used to aggregate the expert output when token $x$ is given as input, with $g_{i}(x)=0$ if expert $e_{i}$ is not selected. From these accumulated router scores, we can obtain an empirical probability distribution vector, denoted as $z=z^{\\prime} /\\left\\|z^{\\prime}\\right\\|_{1}$, representing the distribution of all experts over the C 4 validation set. Then we computed the following metrics proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to assess the usage and distribution of experts:\n\n- Expert Usage: the fraction of experts retrieved during inference: $\\#\\left\\{z_{i} \\neq 0\\right\\}$\n- Unevenness: KL divergence between $z$ and the uniform distribution: $\\log (N)+\\sum_{i} z_{i} \\log \\left(z_{i}\\right)$\nwhere $N$ is the number of total experts. By default, we also added a batch normalization (BN) layer on top of the query network, as proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to increase the expert usage during training. Here we study the effect of adding this BN layer on the above-mentioned metrics. Table 2 presents the expert usage and unevenness for varying numbers of experts, with and without BN. We can see that even for 1 M experts, the expert usage is close to $100 \\%$, and using BN can lead to more balanced utilization of the experts and lower perplexities. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEER model in utilizing a large number of experts. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-08.jpg?height=722&width=985&top_left_y=845&top_left_x=559)\n\nFigure 4: Query BatchNorm Ablation. IsoFLOP curves of a PEER model with 1 M experts on the C4 dataset, with and without query BatchNorm. We additionally compared isoFLOP curves with and without BN. Fig. 4 shows that the PEER model with BN generally achieves lower perplexities. While the difference is not significant, it is most pronounced around the isoFLOP-optimal region. ## 4 Related Works\n\nMixture of Expert Since Shazeer et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparsely-gated Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) in efficiently increasing model capacity on GPU clusters, MoEs have emerged as a popular technique for scaling large models efficiently. Subsequent research (Fedus et al. 2022 Lepikhin et al. 2020 , Du et al., 2022 has proposed variations to address challenges such as load balancing, communication overhead, and training instability. These methods usually replace feedforward (FFW) layers in certain Transformer blocks with sparsely-gated MoE layers, which consist of multiple FFW layers as experts. Typically each expert matches the size of the regular dense FFW layer. Gating scores are calculated for each expert and token, and only the top k experts are activated for each token. These methods are known as token-choice methods. More recently, Zhou et al. (2022) introduced the Expert Choice routing method, where experts choose the top k tokens instead of tokens selecting experts. However, both token-choice and expert-choice methods require the top-k operator on a gating score matrix of size $N \\times M$ ( $N$ : number of experts, $M$ : number of tokens), resulting in a routing cost of at least $O(N)$. This limits their practical application to a small number of experts (typically less than 128). Instead of using the top-k operator, some works also proposed using deterministic hash tables as routers (Roller et al. 2021, dos Santos et al. 2023). With $O(1)$ average lookup complexity, these methods offer potential scalability to a large number of experts. However, these routers are fixed and not learned. Clark et al. (2022) showed that deterministic routing does not scale as well as trainable routers. Furthermore, Dikkala et al. (2023) proved theoretically that learned routers offer non-trivial advantages over their fixed counterparts, such as removing spurious directions and identifying latent clusters in data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed PEER layer employs a learned router with sublinear $(O(\\sqrt{N}))$ complexity. Since PEER uses lightweight experts, our work is also related to recent studies on parameter-efficient MoEs Wang et al. 2022, Zadouri et al., 2024). These methods utilize parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) adapters as experts instead of full-sized FFWs. Their focus is on minimizing the number of parameters updated during fine-tuning, allowing storage of only one copy of the large backbone model. In PEER, parameter efficiency refers to the small number of active parameters in the MoE layer, which directly affects FLOPs and activation memory consumption during pre-training and inference. However, PEER could potentially be adapted to retrieve a large number of PEFT adapters. Retrieval-Augmented Models Our proposed method, with its retrieval mechanism for a large number of experts, aligns with the emerging field of retrieval-augmented models. These models facilitate large model memorization by retrieving knowledge from external databases, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency on knowledge-intensive tasks. Some notable works in this domain include ones by Khandelwal et al. (2019); Borgeaud et al. (2022a); Guu et al. (2020). While these methods retrieve data in various formats, for instance, tokens (Khandelwal et al. 2019), chunks (Borgeaud et al. 2022b) or knowledge graphs (Kang et al., 2023) (see (Gao et al. 2023) for a comprehensive survey on this topic), they differ from the proposed method in that they retrieve data rather than learned functions (experts). This distinction sets our parameter-efficient expert retrieval approach apart from existing retrieval-augmented models. Efficient Feedforward Layers Enhancing the efficiency of feedforward networks has been a long-standing area of research. Similar to PEER, most approaches are based on the idea of conditional computation (Bengio, 2013), where a gating mechanism is trained to determine which subset of neurons to compute. For instance, Davis \\& Arel (2013) utilized low-rank weight matrix approximation to estimate the sign of prenonlinearity activations. Neurons with negative activations are omitted as they will produce zeros after the nonlinearity. Bengio et al. (2015) explored reinforcement learning to develop an activation-dependant policy for dropping blocks of neurons. More recently, Belcak \\& Wattenhofer (2023) introduced the Fast FeedForward (FFF) layer that employs a differentiable balanced binary tree to select a neuron block for computation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nDuring inference, only one leaf (corresponding to one block) is selected, hence it has $O(\\log (N))$ complexity, where $N$ is the total number of blocks in the tree. However, during training, all leaves and intermediate nodes are activated for gradient calculation, imposing a training complexity of $O(N)$ and limiting the total number of blocks. The most relevant work to ours is the Product Key Memory (PKM) (Lample et al., 2019), whose retrieval technique is utilized as the router in the PEER layer. However, PKM retrieves memory vectors instead of functions, thus their values cannot vary according to the inputs. As we show in Section 3 by changing the memory vectors to input-dependent expert networks, PEER can achieve significantly higher efficiency than PKM. Finally, Csord\u00e1s et al. (2023) presented a unified view encompassing FFW, MoE and PKM and proposed to change the router normalization function in MoE and PKM from softmax to sigmoid or ReLU. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces a fine-grained MoE architecture that decomposes an extremely wide dense feedforward layer into a large number of small experts. This design is supported by the recent discovery of the finegrained MoE scaling law. To overcome the computational overhead of routing to a large number of experts, we apply the product keys to efficiently select a small subset of hidden neurons within a wide MLP layer. Empirical analysis using language modeling tasks demonstrate that given the same compute budget, PEER significantly outperforms dense transformers, coarse-grained MoEs and product key memory layers. ## Acknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Adam Santoro, Arthur Guez, Arthur Szlam, Andrei Rusu, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Simon Schug, Utku Evci, Doina Precup and Razvan Pascanu for their insightful discussions and invaluable advice.

UTNet: A Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architectures*\n\n*Dimitris Metaxas, Mu Zhou, Yunhe Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has emerged to be successful in a number of natural language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end, we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. SSR: Spatial Sequential Hybrid Architecture for Latency Throughput Tradeoff in Transformer Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architectures*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increase in the computation intensity of the chip, the mismatch between computation layer shapes and the available computation resource significantly limits the utilization of the chip. Driven by this observation, prior works discuss spatial accelerators or dataflow architecture to maximize the throughput. However, using spatial accelerators could potentially increase the execution latency. In this work, we first systematically investigate two execution models: (1) sequentially (temporally) launch one monolithic accelerator, and (2) spatially launch multiple accelerators. From the observations, we find that there is a latency throughput tradeoff between these two execution models, and combining these two strategies together can give us a more efficient latency throughput Pareto front. To achieve this, we propose spatial sequential architecture (SSR) and SSR design automation framework to explore both strategies together when deploying deep learning inference. We use the 7nm AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 board to implement SSR accelerators for four end-to-end transformer-based deep learning models. SSR achieves average throughput gains of 2.53x, 35.71x, and 14.20x under different batch sizes compared to the 8nm Nvidia GPU A10G, 16nm AMD FPGAs ZCU102, and U250. The average energy efficiency gains are 8.51x, 6.75x, and 21.22x, respectively. Compared with the sequential-only solution and spatial-only solution on VCK190, our spatial-sequential-hybrid solutions achieve higher throughput under the same latency requirement and lower latency under the same throughput requirement.

This reduces computational complexity and memory usage, which is vital for handling long sequences efficiently[Analysis].\n\n## Flexible and Efficient Execution\n\n- **Hybrid Programming Model**: The concept of a hybrid programming model, as seen in the HybridFlow framework, can be applied to language models. This model allows for flexible representation and efficient execution of complex dataflows, which can be beneficial for intra-node computation and inter-node data resharding in distributed language model training. It enables efficient distributed execution and flexible inter-node data transfer, which are critical for scaling large language models.\n\n## Scalability and Flexibility\n\n- **Modular Design**: Modern architectures, such as those using microservices or serverless designs, emphasize scalability and flexibility. These architectures allow individual components to be scaled independently based on demand, which is crucial for large-scale language models. This modular approach ensures that the system can grow and adapt without significant overhead.\n\n## Empirical Validation\n\n- **Empirical Validation**: Conducting extensive empirical validation is essential to assess the impact of proposed modifications on model performance and efficiency.

Introduction\n\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the new engine of state-of-the-art deep learning systems, leading to many recent breakthroughs in language (Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020) and vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Although they have been growing in model size, most Transformers are still limited to short context size due to their quadratic complexity over the input length. This limitation prevents Transformer models from processing long-term information, a critical property for many applications. Many techniques have been proposed to speedup Transformers over extended context via more efficient attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2019; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). Despite the linear theoretical complexity for some of those methods, vanilla Transformers still remain as the dominant choice in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-01.jpg?height=589&width=763&top_left_y=622&top_left_x=1104)\n\nFigure 1: TPU-v4 training speedup of FLASH relative to the vanilla Transformer (TFM) and an augmented Transformer (TFM++) for auto-regressive language modeling on Wiki40B - All models are comparable in size at around 110M and trained for 125 K steps with $2^{18}$ tokens per batch. state-of-the-art systems. Here we examine this issue from a practical perspective, and find existing efficient attention methods suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks:\n\n- Inferior Quality. Our studies reveal that vanilla Transformers, when augmented with several simple tweaks, can be much stronger than the common baselines used in the literature (see Transformer vs. Transformer++ in Figure 1). Existing efficient attention methods often incur significant quality drop compared to augmented Transformers, and this drop outweighs their efficiency benefits. - Overhead in Practice. As efficient attention methods often complicate Transformer layers and require extensive memory re-formatting operations, there can be a nontrivial gap between their theoretical complexity and empirical speed on accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs. - Inefficient Auto-regressive Training. Most attention linearization techniques enjoy fast decoding during inference, but can be extremely slow to train on auto-regressive tasks such as language modeling. This is primarily due to their RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps, making it infeasible to fully leverage the strength of modern accelerators during training. [^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-02.jpg?height=469&width=1690&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=179)\n\nFigure 2: (a) An augmented Transformer layer which consists of two blocks: Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), (b) Our proposed Gated Attention Unit (GAU), (c) Pseudocode for Gated Attention Unit. Skip connection and input normalization over the residual branch are omitted in (a), (b) for brevity. We address the above issues by developing a new model family that, for the first time, not only achieves parity with fully augmented Transformers in quality, but also truly enjoys linear scalability over the context size on modern accelerators. Unlike existing efficient attention methods which directly aim to approximate the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in Transformers, we start with a new layer design which naturally enables higher-quality approximation. Specifically, our model, named FLASH, is developed in two steps:\n\nFirst, we propose a new layer that is more desirable for effective approximation. We introduce a gating mechanism to alleviate the burden of self-attention, resulting in the Gated Attention Unit (GAU) in Figure 2. As compared to Transformer layers, each GAU layer is cheaper, and more importantly, its quality relies less on the precision of attention. In fact, GAU with a small single-head, softmax-free attention is as performant as Transformers. While GAU still suffers from quadratic complexity over the context size, it weakens the role of attention hence allows us to carry out approximation later with minimal quality loss. We then propose an efficient method to approximate the quadratic attention in GAU, leading to a layer variant with linear complexity over the context size. The key idea is to first group tokens into chunks, then using precise quadratic attention within a chunk and fast linear attention across chunks, as illustrated in Figure 4. We further describe how an accelerator-efficient implementation can be naturally derived from this formulation, achieving linear scalability in practice with only a few lines of code change. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of FLASH over a variety of tasks (masked and autoregressive language modeling), datasets (C4, Wiki-40B, PG19) and model scales (110M to 500M). Remarkably, FLASH is competitive with fully-augmented Transformers (Transformer++) in quality across a wide range of context sizes of practical interest (512-8K), while achieving linear scalability on modern hardware accelerators. For example, with comparable quality, FLASH achieves a speedup of $1.2 \\times-$ $4.9 \\times$ for language modeling on Wiki-40B and a speedup of $1.0 \\times-4.8 \\times$ for masked language modeling on C 4 over Transformer++. As we further scale up to PG-19 (Rae et al., 2019), FLASH reduces the training cost of Transformer++ by up to $12.1 \\times$ and achieves significant gain in quality. ## 2. Gated Attention Unit\n\nHere we present Gated Attention Unit (GAU), a simpler yet more performant layer than Transformers. While GAU still has quadratic complexity over the context length, it is more desirable for the approximation method to be presented in Section 3. We start with introducing related layers:\n\nVanilla MLP. Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}$ be the representations over $T$ tokens. The output for Transformer's MLP can be formulated as $O=\\phi\\left(X W_{u}\\right) W_{o}$ where $W_{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times e}, W_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{e \\times d}$. Here $d$ denotes the model size, $e$ denotes the expanded intermediate size, and $\\phi$ is an element-wise activation function. Gated Linear Unit (GLU). This is an improved MLP augmented with gating (Dauphin et al., 2017). GLU has been proven effective in many cases (Shazeer, 2020; Narang et al., 2021) and is used in state-of-the-art Transformer language models (Du et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& U=\\phi_{u}\\left(X W_{u}\\right), \\quad V=\\phi_{v}\\left(X W_{v}\\right) \\quad \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times e} \\\\\n& O=(U \\odot V) W_{o} \\quad \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ stands for element-wise multiplication. In GLU, each representation $u_{i}$ is gated by another representation $v_{i}$ associated with the same token. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-03.jpg?height=485&width=1567&top_left_y=230&top_left_x=256)\n\nFigure 3: GAU vs. Transformers for auto-regressive and masked language modeling on short context length (512). Gated Attention Unit (GAU). The key idea is to formulate attention and GLU as a unified layer and to share their computation as much as possible (Figure 2). This not only results in higher param/compute efficiency, but also naturally enables a powerful attentive gating mechanism. Specifically, GAU generalizes Eq. (2) in GLU as follows:\n\n$$\nO=(U \\odot \\hat{V}) W_{o} \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\hat{V}=A V\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ contains token-token attention weights. Unlike GLU which always uses $v_{i}$ to gate $u_{i}$ (both associated with the same token), our GAU replaces $v_{i}$ with a potentially more relevant representation $\\hat{v}_{i}=\\sum_{j} a_{i j} v_{j}$ \"retrieved\" from all available tokens using attention. The above will reduce to GLU when $A$ is an identity matrix. Consistent with the findings in Liu et al. (2021), the presence of gating allows the use of a much simpler/weaker attention mechanism than MHSA without quality loss:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nZ=\\phi_{z}\\left(X W_{z}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times s} \\\\\nA=\\operatorname{relu}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{Q}(Z) \\mathcal{K}(Z)^{\\top}+b\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n| Modifications | PPLX (LM/MLM) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| original GAU | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 7 8 / 4 . 2 3}$ | 105 |\n| relu $^{2} \\rightarrow$ softmax | $17.04 / 4.31$ | 105 |\n| single-head $\\rightarrow$ multi-head | $17.76 / 4.48$ | 105 |\n| no gating | $17.45 / 4.58$ | 131 |\n\nTable 1: Impact of various modifications on GAU. where $Z$ is a shared representation $(s \\ll d)^{4}, \\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are two cheap transformations that apply per-dim scalars and offsets to $Z$ (similar to the learnable variables in LayerNorms), and $b$ is the relative position bias. We also find the softmax in MHSA can be simplified as a regular activation function in the case of $\\mathrm{GAU}^{5}$. The GAU layer and its\n\n[^2]| Modifications | PPLX (LM/MLM) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| original MHSA | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 8 7} / \\mathbf{4 . 3 5}$ | 110 |\n| softmax $\\rightarrow$ relu $^{2}$ | $17.15 / 4.77$ | 110 |\n| multi-head $\\rightarrow$ single-head | $17.89 / 4.73$ | 110 |\n| add gating | $17.25 / 4.43$ | 106 |\n\nTable 2: Impact of various modifications on MHSA. pseudocode are illustrated in Figure 2. Unlike Transformer's MHSA which comes with $4 d^{2}$ parameters, GAU's attention introduces only a single small dense matrix $W_{z}$ with $d s$ parameters on top of GLU (scalars and offsets in $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are negligible). By setting $e=2 d$ for GAU, this compact design allows us to replace each Transformer block (MLP/GLU + MHSA) with two GAUs while retaining similar model size and training speed. GAU vs. Transformers. Figure 3 shows that GAUs are competitive with Transformers (MSHA + MLP/GLU) on TPUs across different models sizes. Note these experiments are conducted over a relatively short context size (512). We will see later in Section 4 that GAUs are in fact even more performant when the context length is longer, thanks to their reduced capacity in attention. Layer Ablations. In Table $1 \\& 2$ we show that both GAUs and Transformers are locally optimal on their own. ## 3. Fast Linear Attention with GAU\n\nThere are two observations from Section 2 that motivate us to extend GAU to modeling long sequences:\n\n- First, the gating mechanism in GAU allows the use of a weaker (single-headed, softmax-free) attention without quality loss. If we further adapt this intuition into modeling long sequences with attention, GAU could also boost the effectiveness of approximate (weak) attention mechanisms such as local, sparse and linearized attention. - In addition, the number of attention modules is naturally doubled with GAU - recall MLP+MHSA $\\approx 2 \\times$ GAU in terms of cost (Section 2). Since approximate attention usually requires more layers to capture full dependency (Dai et al., 2019; Child et al., 2019), this property also makes GAU more appealing in handling long sequences. With this intuition in mind, we start by reviewing some related work on modeling long sequences with attention, and then show how we enable GAU to achieve Transformerlevel quality in linear time on long sequences. ### 3.1. Existing Linear-Complexity Variants\n\nPartial Attention. A popular class of methods tries to approximate the full attention matrix with different partial/sparse patterns, including local window (Dai et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2019), local+sparse (Child et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020), axial (Ho et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019), learnable patterns through hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020) or clustering (Roy et al., 2021). Though not as effective as full attention, these variants are usually able to enjoy quality gains from scaling to longer sequences. However, the key problem with this class of methods is that they involve extensive irregular or regular memory re-formatting operations such as gather, scatter, slice and concatenation, which are not friendly to modern accelerators of massive parallelism, particularly specialized ASICs like TPU. As a result, their practical benefits (speed and RAM efficiency), if any, largely depend on the choice of accelerator and usually fall behind the theoretical analysis. Hence, in this work, we deliberately minimize the number of memory re-formatting operations in our model. Linear Attention. Alternatively, another popular line of research linearizes the attention computation by decomposing the attention matrix and then re-arranging the order of matrix multiplications (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). Schematically, the linear attention can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}_{\\text {lin }}=Q \\underbrace{\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)}_{\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}} \\xrightarrow{\\text { approx }} \\hat{V}_{\\text {quad }}=\\operatorname{Softmax} \\underbrace{\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)}_{\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}} V\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d}$ are the query, key and value representations, respectively. Re-arranging the computation reduces the complexity w.r.t $T$ from quadratic to linear. Another desirable property of linear attention is its constant ${ }^{6}$ computation and memory for each auto-regressive decoding step at inference time. To see that, define $M_{t}=K_{: t}^{\\top} V_{: t}$ and notice that the computation of $M_{t}$ can be fully incremental:\n\n$$\nM_{t}=M_{t-1}+K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}\n$$\n\n[^3]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_969875b4cce3c3c484feg-04.jpg?height=758&width=817&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=1055)\n\nFigure 4: (top) Quadratic attention, (mid) Linear attention, (bottom) Proposed mixed chunk attention with a chunk size $(C)$ of 2 ( $C$ is always greater than or equal to 128 in our experiments). Our method significantly reduces the compute in quadratic attention (red links), while requiring substantially less RNN-style steps (green squares) in conventional linear attention. This means we only need to maintain a cache with constant $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ memory and whenever a new input arrives at time stamp $t$, only constant $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ computation is required to accumulate $K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}$ into $M_{t-1}$ and get $M_{t}$. On the contrary, full quadratic attention requires linear $\\mathcal{O}(T d)$ computation and memory for each decoding step, as each new input has to attend to all the previous steps. However, on the other hand, re-arranging the computation in linear attention leads to a severe inefficiency during autoregressive training. As shown in Fig. 4 (mid), due to the causal constraint for auto-regressive training, the query vector at each time step $Q_{t}$ corresponds to a different cache value $M_{t}=K_{: t}^{\\top} V_{: t}$. This requires the model to compute and cache $T$ different values $\\left\\{M_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ instead of only one value $K^{\\top} V$ in the non-autoregressive case. In theory, the sequence $\\left\\{M_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ can be obtained in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T d^{2}\\right)$ by first computing $\\left\\{K_{t} V_{t}^{\\top}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ and then performing a large cumulative sum (cumsum) over $T$ tokens. But in practice, the cumsum introduces an RNN-style sequential dependency of $T$ steps, where an $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ state needs to be processed each step. The sequential dependency not only limits the degree of parallelism, but more importantly requires $T$ memory access in the loop, which usually costs much more time than computing the element-wise addition on modern accelerators. As a result, there exists a considerable gap between the theoretical complexity and actual running time. In practice, we find that directly computing the full quadratic attention matrix is\neven faster than the re-arranged (linearized) version on both TPUs (Figure 6(a)) and GPUs (Appendix C.1). ### 3.2. Our Method: Mixed Chunk Attention\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of existing linearcomplexity attentions, we propose mixed chunk attention, which merges the benefits from both partial attention and linear attention. The high-level idea is illustrated in Figure 4. Below we reformulate GAU to incorporate this idea. Preparation. The input sequence is first chunked into $G$ non-overlapping chunks of size $C$, i.e. $[T] \\rightarrow[T / C \\times$ $C]$. Then, $U_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times e}, V_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times e}$ and $Z_{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times s}$ are produced for each chunk $g$ following the GAU formulation in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/51 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n# Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training \n\nSonglin Yang ${ }^{1 *}$ Bailin Wang ${ }^{1 *}$ Yikang Shen ${ }^{2}$ Rameswar Panda ${ }^{2}$ Yoon Kim ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form.

This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1.

However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Michael Poli, Armin W.

Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan, Yuan-Fang Li, Yuxuan Liang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaoming Shi, James Y. Zhang, Zhixuan Chu, Lintao Ma, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. LiDAR4D: Dynamic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Changjun Jiang, Guang Chen, Weiyi Xue, Fan Lu, Zehan Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS), LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction.

MaxQ: Multi-Axis Query for N:M Sparsity Network\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Yong liu, Linpeng Peng, Tianxin Huang, Zhuangzhi Chen, JunHao Chen, Siqi Li, Jingyang Xiang*\n\n**Abstract:** N:M sparsity has received increasing attention due to its remarkable performance and latency trade-off compared with structured and unstructured sparsity. However, existing N:M sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides, they directly apply N:M sparsity to the whole network, which will cause severe information loss. Thus, they are still sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology, dubbed as MaxQ, to rectify these problems. During the training, MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:M masks, considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile, a sparsity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:M weight blocks is applied, which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime, the N:M soft masks can be precomputed as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring additional computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improvements across diverse CNN architectures in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern, MaxQ can achieve 74.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8\\% over the state-of-the-art.

These models use a gated structure that allows them to uncover relationships far in the past and employ a self-attention mechanism that is highly parallelizable and efficient. The gating mechanism controls the flow of information, enabling the network to learn the decay rate for each element of the recurrent states, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently.\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity Patterns\n\n- Dynamic sparsity patterns can significantly optimize computational complexity and memory usage. The idea of sparse attention mechanisms, as discussed in, can be adapted to incorporate dynamic sparsity. Sparse attention focuses only on the most relevant tokens, reducing both memory and computational requirements. This approach can be integrated into gated attention units to further enhance efficiency.\n- The use of efficient architectures like Linformer or Performer, which aim to reduce the complexity of self-attention, can also be beneficial. These architectures often employ techniques that can be adapted to dynamic sparsity patterns, such as linear element-wise multiplications instead of quadratic matrix multiplications, as seen in SwiftFormer.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures and Specialized Layers\n\n- Hybrid architectures that combine different types of layers, such as gated mechanisms and specialized attention layers, offer significant potential for improving scalability and efficiency. The paper on \"Mechanic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures\" (though not directly referenced in the provided sources) suggests that integrating such layers can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of language models.\n- The \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" concept (referenced in the analysis) describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability, which is highly relevant for optimizing the performance of gated attention units.\n\n## Empirical Validation and Implementation\n\n- Empirical validation is crucial to assess the impact of these modifications on model performance and efficiency. Experiments such as those conducted with AGaLiTe, which showed improved performance and reduced computational and memory costs compared to state-of-the-art models like GTrXL, provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these approaches.\n\n## Key Strategies for Implementation\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Implement sparse attention to reduce the number of computations by focusing only on the most relevant tokens.\n- **Efficient Architectures**: Explore architectures like SwiftFormer, which replace traditional quadratic matrix multiplication operations with linear element-wise multiplications, enhancing computational efficiency.\n- **Gated Mechanisms**: Integrate gated attention units that control the flow of information, allowing for more efficient handling of long sequences.\n- **Dynamic Sparsity**: Adapt dynamic sparsity patterns to optimize computational complexity and memory usage based on input data.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage gated attention units and dynamic sparsity patterns to improve performance and reduce computational costs.\n",

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. $\\left[\\mathrm{LKV}^{+}\\right.$18] Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Charles Windolf, and Thomas Serre.

One Model To Learn Them All\n\n*From Search Query: gated sparse attention training*\n\n*Ashish Vaswani, Lukasz Kaiser, Llion Jones, Noam Shazeer, Jakob Uszkoreit, Aidan N. Gomez, Niki Parmar*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning yields great results across many fields, from speech\nrecognition, image classification, to translation. But for each problem,\ngetting a deep model to work well involves research into the architecture and a\nlong period of tuning. We present a single model that yields good results on a\nnumber of problems spanning multiple domains. In particular, this single model\nis trained concurrently on ImageNet, multiple translation tasks, image\ncaptioning (COCO dataset), a speech recognition corpus, and an English parsing\ntask. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multiple\ndomains. It contains convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and\nsparsely-gated layers. Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a\nsubset of the tasks we train on. Interestingly, even if a block is not crucial\nfor a task, we observe that adding it never hurts performance and in most cases\nimproves it on all tasks. We also show that tasks with less data benefit\nlargely from joint training with other tasks, while performance on large tasks\ndegrades only slightly if at all.\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. JetMoE: Reaching Llama2 Performance with 0.1M Dollars\n\n*From Search Query: gated sparse attention training*\n\n*Zengyi Qin, Tianle Cai, Zhen Guo, Yikang Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, but their increasing resource demand has become a major obstacle to the development of powerful and accessible super-human intelligence. This report introduces JetMoE-8B, a new LLM trained with less than $0.1 million, using 1.25T tokens from carefully mixed open-source corpora and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, the JetMoE-8B demonstrates impressive performance, with JetMoE-8B outperforming the Llama2-7B model and JetMoE-8B-Chat surpassing the Llama2-13B-Chat model. These results suggest that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. JetMoE-8B is based on an efficient Sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture, composed of attention and feedforward experts. Both layers are sparsely activated, allowing JetMoE-8B to have 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. Moreover, JetMoE-8B is highly open and academia-friendly, using only public datasets and training code. All training parameters and data mixtures have been detailed in this report to facilitate future efforts in the development of open foundation models. This transparency aims to encourage collaboration and further advancements in the field of accessible and efficient LLMs. The model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myshell-ai/JetMoE.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. DeepSpeed Ulysses: System Optimizations for Enabling Training of Extreme Long Sequence Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: long sequence optimization*\n\n*Shuaiwen Leon Song, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Minjia Zhang, Chengming Zhang, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs*\n\n**Abstract:** Computation in a typical Transformer-based large language model (LLM) can be characterized by batch size, hidden dimension, number of layers, and sequence length. Until now, system works for accelerating LLM training have focused on the first three dimensions: data parallelism for batch size, tensor parallelism for hidden size and pipeline parallelism for model depth or layers. These widely studied forms of parallelism are not targeted or optimized for long sequence Transformer models. Given practical application needs for long sequence LLM, renewed attentions are being drawn to sequence parallelism. However, existing works in sequence parallelism are constrained by memory-communication inefficiency, limiting their scalability to long sequence large models. In this work, we introduce DeepSpeed-Ulysses, a novel, portable and effective methodology for enabling highly efficient and scalable LLM training with extremely long sequence length. DeepSpeed-Ulysses at its core partitions input data along the sequence dimension and employs an efficient all-to-all collective communication for attention computation. Theoretical communication analysis shows that whereas other methods incur communication overhead as sequence length increases, DeepSpeed-Ulysses maintains constant communication volume when sequence length and compute devices are increased proportionally. Furthermore, experimental evaluations show that DeepSpeed-Ulysses trains 2.5x faster with 4x longer sequence length than the existing method SOTA baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mini-Sequence Transformer: Optimizing Intermediate Memory for Long Sequences Training\n\n*From Search Query: long sequence optimization*\n\n*Anima Anandkumar, Beidi Chen, Zhuoming Chen, Jiawei Zhao, Cheng Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT), a simple and effective methodology for highly efficient and accurate LLM training with extremely long sequences. MsT partitions input sequences and iteratively processes mini-sequences to reduce intermediate memory usage. Integrated with activation recomputation, it enables significant memory savings in both forward and backward passes. In experiments with the Llama3-8B model, with MsT, we measure no degradation in throughput or convergence even with 12x longer sequences than standard implementations. MsT is fully general, implementation-agnostic, and requires minimal code changes to integrate with existing LLM training frameworks. Integrated with the huggingface library, MsT successfully extends the maximum context length of Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2 by 12-24x.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-22\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware attention implementation*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware attention implementation*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on gated sparse attention, long sequence optimization, and hardware-specific implementations, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Training Methods and Stability Techniques for Gated Sparse Attention Models\n\n1. **SeerAttention**:\n   - This method introduces a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in an attention map, deeming the rest sparse. The training involves using a 2D max-pooled attention map from full attention as ground truth to guide the AttnGate. This approach ensures stable training and enhances model performance and sparsity ratios.\n\n2. **Probabilistic Sparse Attention**:\n   - In the context of the Conformer-CTC/Attention model, probabilistic sparse attention is used to reduce computational complexity and memory usage. This method helps in addressing convergence challenges during training, especially with long input feature sequences.\n\n### Memory Optimization Approaches for Handling Long Sequences\n\n1. **SeerAttention**:\n   - SeerAttention demonstrates effective memory optimization by achieving high sparsity ratios (up to 90%) with minimal loss in accuracy. This is particularly beneficial for long-context fine-tuning, where it can maintain performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.\n\n2. **PagedAttention and Virtual Memory Approaches**:\n   - Although not directly mentioned in the provided sources, references like \"Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\" suggest that virtual memory approaches can efficiently manage memory for long sequences, reducing the need for extensive memory resources (indirectly through the analysis note).\n\n### Hardware-Specific Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Memristor-Based Hardware Acceleration**:\n   - This approach leverages memristor-based in-memory computing to accelerate transformer self-attention. The hardware accelerator optimizes the training process by controlling the plasticity and stability of neural connections, which is crucial for neural network learning and memory storage.\n\n2. **IO-Aware Implementations**:\n   - FlashAttention and similar IO-aware algorithms are designed to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, providing significant performance gains. These implementations are essential for real-world efficiency improvements[Analysis Note].\n\n### Integration Strategies for Combining Gating with Sparse Attention Patterns\n\n1. **SeerAttention Integration**:\n   - SeerAttention integrates a learnable gate with sparse attention patterns, allowing for adaptive selection of significant blocks in the attention map. This integration enables flexible usage and adjustment of sparsity ratios during inference, balancing accuracy and efficiency.\n\n2. **Combining Gating and Sparsity**:\n   - The analysis note highlights that combining gating with sparsity requires careful design. Methods like Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) and Performers show promise in approximating full attention with linear complexity while reducing computation and memory consumption[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the SeerAttention mechanism stands out for its ability to learn intrinsic sparse attention, which is crucial for both training stability and memory optimization. Hardware-specific implementations, such as memristor-based accelerators and IO-aware attention algorithms, are vital for efficient processing. The integration of gating with sparse attention, as seen in SeerAttention, provides a robust framework for balancing accuracy and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al.

KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly.

Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a\nsignificant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt\nlengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\ncomputation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens\n(i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for\nspeeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency\nwhen applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference\n(Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate\npre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique\npatterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and\nBlock-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We\ndetermine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically\nbuild sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the\npattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations\nvia our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the\npre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly\napplied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or\nadditional fine-tuning.

This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose\nFlattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the\nKV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU\nutilization during attention computations.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Martin Jaggi, Daniele Paliotta, Matteo Pagliardini*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

This architecture replaces the standard attention layer with a gated linear attention mechanism, which computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. This approach reduces computational complexity and improves training stability and length generalization.\n\n- The GLA Transformer integrates data-dependent gates, which help in capturing more expressive relationships within the input data. This is particularly effective in moderate-scale language modeling experiments, showing competitive performance against other linear-time-inference baselines.\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity Patterns in Attention Mechanisms and Their Impact on Model Performance\n\n- Dynamic sparsity patterns can be implemented by adapting the attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence dynamically. For instance, the use of dynamic sparse attention can help in reducing computational complexity while maintaining model performance. However, there is a trade-off between sparsity and model quality, which needs careful balancing.\n\n- The concept of dynamic sparsity is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources, but the idea of adaptive spatial aggregation and advanced structural design in window-based transformers can be seen as a form of dynamic sparsity. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Sparse Operations in Neural Networks\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations can be achieved through specialized algorithms and hardware designs. For example, the FLASHLINEARATTENTION algorithm trades off memory movement against parallelizability, making it faster than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention even on short sequence lengths.\n\n- The use of memristor-based in-memory computing can also accelerate sparse operations. This approach integrates computation into memory using memristor crossbar arrays, which can perform matrix operations in an analog manner, reducing the overhead associated with data transfer.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Memory optimization can be achieved through efficient attention mechanisms such as linear attention. The GLA Transformer, for instance, enjoys linear-time inference complexity, which is beneficial for memory optimization. Additionally, the use of shared terms in linear attention reduces the computational complexity and memory requirements.\n\n- The Mix-FFN block proposed in the context of linear DiT (Denoising Transformers) incorporates depth-wise convolution to aggregate local information, which helps in reducing the need for positional encoding and thus optimizes memory usage.\n\n## Training Stability Considerations for Gated and Sparse Architectures\n\n- Training stability is a critical aspect, especially when integrating gated mechanisms with linear attention. The GLA Transformer has been found to perform competitively and maintain stability during training, which is attributed to the gated mechanisms that help in capturing diverse relationships within the input data.\n\n- The use of Mix-FFN blocks and other micro-designs in linear DiT also helps in improving training efficiency and stability. These designs compensate for the weaker local information-capturing ability of linear attention, leading to more stable convergence during training.\n\nIn summary, the integration of gated mechanisms with linear attention, as seen in the GLA Transformer, offers a promising approach for improving autoregressive language models. Dynamic sparsity can be explored through adaptive attention mechanisms, and hardware-efficient implementations can be achieved through specialized algorithms and hardware designs like memristor-based computing. Memory optimization techniques, such as shared terms in linear attention and efficient feed-forward networks, are also crucial for maintaining efficiency and stability during training.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: training stability sparse attention, hardware optimization attention, memory efficient transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: training stability sparse attention*\n\n*Rico Sennrich, Ivan Titov, Biao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off') for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Many of the state-of-the-arts methods use complex network structures with multiple branches that fuse multiple features while training or testing, using classification loss, Triplet loss or a combination of the two as loss function. However, the method that using Triplet loss as loss function converges slowly, and the method in which pull features of the same class as close as possible in features space leads to poor feature stability. This paper will combine the ranking motivated structured loss, proposed a new metric learning loss function that make the features of the same class are sparsely distributed into the range of small hyperspheres and the features of different classes are uniformly distributed at a clearly angle. And adopted a new single-branch network structure that only using global feature can also get great performance. The validity of our method is verified on the Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID person re-identification datasets. Finally acquires 90.9% rank-1 accuracy and 80.8% mAP on DukeMTMC-reID, 95.3% rank-1 accuracy and 88.7% mAP on Market1501. Codes and models are available in Github.https://github.com/Qidian213/Ranked_Person_ReID.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. We release the code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LeViT\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention*\n\n*Jian Ren, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Kamyar Salahi, Georgios Evangelidis, Yang Wen, Ju Hu, Yanyu Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. This work demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance even with MobileNet-level size and speed.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

This approach avoids predefined sparsity patterns and heuristics, allowing the model to adapt to various context lengths and sparsity ratios. SeerAttention trains an attention gate to learn block-level sparsity, which enhances efficiency and maintains near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels.\n\n### Load Balancing in Mixture of Experts\nMixture of Experts (MoE) models, such as the Switch Transformer, address training instability issues through load balancing. By adding an auxiliary loss (load balancing loss), the model ensures that all experts have equal importance, preventing overfitting on a subset of experts. This technique is crucial for maintaining training stability in sparse models.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations for Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly optimize the hardware for transformer networks. This approach leverages the properties of memristors to perform synaptic updates efficiently, which is crucial for attention mechanisms. The precise timing and duration of electrical pulses applied to memristors play a critical role in controlling the plasticity and stability of neural connections, making this hardware optimization highly relevant.\n\n### Customized FlashAttention Kernel\nSeerAttention develops a customized FlashAttention kernel that effectively obtains block-level attention map ground truth, enabling scalable learning of sparse attention. This kernel demonstrates up to a speedup over dense baseline attention mechanisms at high context sizes with significant sparsity, highlighting its hardware efficiency.\n\n## Memory Management and Efficiency Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Sparsity\nDynamic sparsity in attention mechanisms, as seen in SeerAttention, reduces the memory footprint while maintaining performance. This approach is particularly effective for long-context sequences, where sparsity becomes more pronounced and offers significant opportunities for optimization.\n\n### Mixture of Experts\nMoE models, like the Switch Transformer, optimize memory usage by activating only a subset of experts during inference. This sparse parameter activation reduces the computational requirements, even though the entire model needs to be loaded onto the device. This approach is memory-efficient and can handle longer sequences with fewer active parameters.\n\n### Head-Split Sparse-Dense Attention\nThe Head-Split Sparse-Dense Attention (HSDA) method divides attention heads into sparse and dense groups, which helps in capturing both temporal and spatial features efficiently. This method reduces computation by about 10% while maintaining performance, making it a viable strategy for memory-efficient transformer architectures.\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Gated Mechanisms with Sparse Attention Patterns\n\n### SeerAttention Integration\nSeerAttention integrates gated mechanisms with sparse attention patterns by training an attention gate to learn block-level sparsity. This integration allows for flexible usage, enabling users to adjust the Top-k ratio to balance accuracy and efficiency with a single model. The gate parameters can be learned during post-training or fine-tuning, making this approach highly adaptable.\n\n### Mixture of Experts with Sparse Attention\nCombining MoE with sparse attention can further enhance efficiency. By selecting a subset of experts based on the input, MoE models can leverage sparse attention patterns to reduce computational and memory requirements. The Switch Transformer's top-1 routing mechanism can be integrated with dynamic sparsity patterns to achieve both training stability and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the integration of adaptive sparsity learning (SeerAttention), memristor-based hardware accelerators, dynamic sparsity in MoE models, and head-split sparse-dense attention mechanisms can significantly improve the training stability, hardware efficiency, and memory management of autoregressive language models. These strategies offer a balanced approach to optimizing performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention optimization*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Rethinking Attention with Performers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention optimization*\n\n*Lukasz Kaiser, Andreea Gane, Valerii Likhosherstov, Lucy Colwell, Afroz Mohiuddin, Xingyou Song, Krzysztof Choromanski, Adrian Weller, Jared Davis, David Dohan, David Belanger, Tamas Sarlos, Peter Hawkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient transformer*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient transformer*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Hanrui Wang, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Ligeng Zhu, Han Cai, Chuang Gan*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with $\\textit{arbitrary encoder-decoder attention}$ and $\\textit{heterogeneous layers}$. Then we train a $\\textit{SuperTransformer}$ that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many $\\textit{SubTransformers}$ with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized $\\textit{SubTransformer}$ dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT'14 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve $\\textbf{3}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.7}\\times$ smaller size over baseline Transformer; $\\textbf{2.7}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.6}\\times$ smaller size over Evolved Transformer with $\\textbf{12,041}\\times$ less search cost and no performance loss.

Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: memory management attention*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. Few-Shot Generalization Across Dialogue Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: memory management attention*\n\n*Akela Drissner-Schmid, Vladimir Vlasov, Alan Nichol*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine-learning based dialogue managers are able to learn complex behaviors\nin order to complete a task, but it is not straightforward to extend their\ncapabilities to new domains. We investigate different policies' ability to\nhandle uncooperative user behavior, and how well expertise in completing one\ntask (such as restaurant reservations) can be reapplied when learning a new one\n(e.g. booking a hotel). We introduce the Recurrent Embedding Dialogue Policy\n(REDP), which embeds system actions and dialogue states in the same vector\nspace. REDP contains a memory component and attention mechanism based on a\nmodified Neural Turing Machine, and significantly outperforms a baseline LSTM\nclassifier on this task. We also show that both our architecture and baseline\nsolve the bAbI dialogue task, achieving 100% test accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2018-11-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention optimization, hardware-efficient transformer implementations, memory management strategies, and integration methods for combining sparse and gated attention patterns, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Optimization Techniques for Training Sparse Attention Models\n\n- The paper on \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" introduces the Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention mechanism, which optimizes sparse attention by sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads. This approach ensures that each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context, and achieves significant wall-clock speedups and strong downstream performance.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper argues that attention sparsity should be learned rather than predefined. This approach involves learning intrinsic sparse attention patterns, which can be more efficient and effective than predefined sparse patterns.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Transformer Architectures\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper highlights the importance of designing sparse attention mechanisms with hardware and software systems in mind. It emphasizes the use of hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention to balance efficiency and performance. The S2-Attention kernel provides optimized implementations for sparse attention, leading to substantial speedups compared to dense attention baselines.\n\n- The \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" paper introduces a memristor-based in-memory computing approach for accelerating transformer self-attention. This method leverages analog matrix operations in a memristor crossbar array, significantly improving efficiency in terms of power consumption and latency.\n\n## Memory Management Strategies for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The S2-Attention mechanism addresses the memory bottleneck by designing sparse attention that is compatible with accelerator parallelization and efficient memory access patterns. This approach ensures that the computational savings from sparse attention translate into real-world efficiency gains.\n\n- The \"Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-k Attention\" concept, though not directly mentioned in the provided sources, is referenced in the analysis note. It suggests processing queries in chunks and computing top-k scores with respect to the keys, which reduces memory usage to be linear in the input size[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Sparse and Gated Attention Patterns\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper proposes a hybrid design that combines sparse and dense attention. This approach ensures that the model has direct access to all tokens at certain layers, balancing efficiency and performance. The hybrid architecture is particularly beneficial for long-context tasks.\n\n- The \"MPSA-Conformer-CTC/Attention\" model integrates a Probabilistic Sparse Attention mechanism within a Conformer-CTC/Attention framework. This integration helps in reducing computational complexity and memory usage while enhancing the model's performance and stability. Although focused on speech recognition, the principles can be adapted for text-based models.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Sparse Attention Optimization**: Learning intrinsic sparse attention patterns (SeerAttention) and using context sharding among attention heads (S2-Attention) can significantly improve efficiency and performance.\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Memristor-based in-memory computing and optimized sparse attention kernels (S2-Attention) can provide substantial speedups and efficiency gains.\n\n- **Memory Management**: Hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention, along with chunk-based processing and top-k attention, can effectively manage memory usage and improve performance[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Integration Strategies**: Combining sparse attention with gated mechanisms, such as in the Conformer-CTC/Attention model, can enhance training stability and performance.\n\nThese insights and techniques can help researchers design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

Additionally, these models often struggle with generalization across varied input contexts. This proposal aims to address these limitations by integrating gated attention units and dynamic sparsity patterns into linear attention mechanisms, leveraging hardware-specific optimizations to enhance scalability and robustness.\n\n### Problem Analysis\nTraditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanisms incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability for long sequences. Moreover, fixed positional encodings restrict the model's adaptability to different contexts.

    "abstract": "The proposal introduces GatedSparseLinearAttention (GSLA), a novel enhancement to AdaptiveLinearAttention that integrates gated attention units with dynamic sparsity patterns. By combining the strengths of gated mechanisms and dynamic sparsity, GSLA achieves improved efficiency and scalability for long sequences while maintaining model expressiveness. The design leverages hardware-specific optimizations and efficient integration strategies to reduce memory footprint and computational overhead during both training and inference.",
