Clarity**\n\nThe proposal is clearly articulated with well-defined objectives. It aims to enhance the FastTTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and concepts from the RWKV architecture. The motivation behind the integration is to improve computational efficiency and scalability for long sequences while maintaining test-time training capabilities and preserving model expressiveness. The proposal provides comprehensive details on the modifications, including mathematical formulations and pseudo-code, which contributes to its clarity.\n\n**2. Innovation**\n\nThe proposed modification introduces new and valuable improvements. Integrating GLA with RWKV-inspired stateful representations within the FastTTTLinear GAU is an innovative approach that, based on current literature, has not been extensively explored. While GLA and RWKV architectures have been studied individually, their combination within a test-time training framework like TTTLinear presents a novel idea. This integration has the potential to enhance the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently while improving expressiveness and adaptability.\n\n**3. Feasibility**\n\nThe design is theoretically sound and feasible within the given framework. GLA can replace standard attention mechanisms, offering linear computational complexity, and RWKV-inspired stateful representations can enhance the efficient handling of long sequences. However, integrating these components may increase implementation complexity. Ensuring compatibility between GLA's gating mechanisms, RWKV's stateful updates, and TTTLinear's test-time training requires careful architectural design and validation.\n\n**4. Scalability**\n\nThe design is expected to scale efficiently with larger models and more data. By reducing computational and memory complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to sequence length, the model can handle long sequences without incurring prohibitive costs. The efficient state management provided by RWKV-inspired representations supports scalability, making the model suitable for large-scale language modeling tasks.\n\n**5. Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nThe integration of GLA is likely to enhance the model's expressiveness due to data-dependent gating, which can improve the ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data. RWKV-inspired stateful representations help in modeling long-range dependencies more effectively. Maintaining test-time training capabilities allows the model to adapt during inference, potentially improving robustness to diverse inputs and noisy data.\n\n**6. Efficiency**\n\nThe proposal offers potential improvements in computational efficiency and memory usage. GLA reduces complexity from quadratic to linear, significantly lowering computational overhead for long sequences. The efficient management of hidden states through RWKV-inspired stateful representations further contributes to computational and memory efficiency during both training and inference.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Novel Integration:** The combination of Gated Linear Attention with RWKV-inspired stateful representations within a test-time training framework is innovative and not covered extensively in existing research.\n- **Efficiency Gains:** Achieving linear computational and memory complexity enhances efficiency, especially for long-sequence processing.\n- **Enhanced Expressiveness:** Data-dependent gating from GLA can increase model expressiveness, improving the modeling of complex patterns.\n- **Adaptability:** Test-time training capabilities allow the model to adapt during inference, enhancing performance on unseen or diverse data.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Implementation Complexity:** Integrating multiple advanced mechanisms increases the model's complexity, requiring meticulous implementation and testing.\n- **Compatibility and Stability:** Ensuring seamless interaction between GLA, stateful representations, and test-time training may present challenges, potentially affecting training stability.\n- **Computational Overhead:** While the goal is increased efficiency, the added mechanisms could introduce some computational overhead that needs careful management.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Detailed Implementation Plan:** Provide comprehensive guidelines on integrating GLA with RWKV-inspired stateful representations and test-time training mechanisms. This should include architectural diagrams, parameter initialization strategies, and handling of potential compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Training Stability Strategies:** Develop methods to maintain numerical stability and convergence during training. Techniques such as gradient clipping, appropriate normalization layers, and learning rate scheduling can help mitigate potential training instabilities.\n\n3. **Modular Design Approach:** Implement the components in a modular fashion to facilitate independent testing and debugging. This approach can help manage complexity and make it easier to isolate and resolve issues.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation Plan:** Outline a plan for empirical evaluation of the proposed model on relevant benchmarks, particularly focusing on long-sequence language modeling tasks. This should include comparisons against baseline models to quantify improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.\n\n5. **Address Computational Overhead:** Analyze the computational cost introduced by the integration and optimize the implementation to minimize overhead. Using hardware-efficient training techniques and optimizing memory usage can help maintain the desired efficiency gains.\n\n---\n\n**Final Rating:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the proposal is excellent, demonstrating a high level of innovation with the potential for significant impact in autoregressive language modeling. While there are concerns regarding implementation complexity and training stability, these are addressable with careful planning and thorough validation.\n\n```rating 4.2```",

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer \n\nSimiao Zuo ${ }^{* \\ddagger}$, Xiaodong Liu ${ }^{* \\dagger \\wedge}$, Jian Jiao ${ }^{\\dagger \\diamond}$, Denis Charles ${ }^{\\diamond}$, Eren Manavoglu ${ }^{\\wedge}$,<br>Tuo Zhao ${ }^{\\ddagger}$ and Jianfeng Gao ${ }^{\\circ}$<br>${ }^{\\ddagger}$ Georgia Institute of Technology ${ }^{\\diamond}$ Microsoft\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

The first to obtain high performance on LRA was the S4 model (Gu et al., 2022a), an instance of linear RNNs augmented according to a complementary theory in continuous time (Gu et al, $2020,2022 b$ ). Following S4, multiple works have proposed simplifications to S4 (Gupta et al., 2022a; Gu et al.||2022b; Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023) or augmentations to other common architectures (Li et al., 2022;, Fu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2022), aimed at replicating biases observed in S4 and achieving similar performance on LRA.\n```\n\n#### 3. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/8 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu and Tri Dao. 2023.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4.

Efficient Long-Range Transformers: You Need to Attend More, but Not Necessarily at Every Layer\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Attention*\n\n*Qingru Zhang, Dhananjay Ram, Cole Hawkins, Sheng Zha, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans, is proposed, which is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost - quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Rao, Liu Yang, Sebastian Ruder, Donald Metzler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios is proposed, paving the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1366  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 6. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformers*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 215  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Linear State Space Models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview\n\n*From Search Query: Linear State Space Models*\n\n*Carmen Amo Alonso, Jerome Sieber, Melanie N. Zeilinger*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear\nstate-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation\nmodels. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better\nperformance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language\ntasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a\nlatent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The\nsame goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model\ndynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence\nmodeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the\ncorresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction\nto SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest\nresearch developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful\nSSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic\nperspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models,\nevaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing\na model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-25T16:10:47Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T16:10:47Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Linear State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\n*From Search Query: Linear State Space Models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Tri Dao, Khaled Saab, Karan Goel, Isys Johnson, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Conference:** combining-recurrent-convolutional-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficient Long-Range Attention Network for Image Super-resolution\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Attention*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Shi Guo, Hui Zeng, Xindong Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in various vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the self-attention (SA) for feature extraction. However, the computation of SA in most existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed operations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA computation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an efficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we first employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image local structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as 1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA) module, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using different window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly efficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading two shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a shared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a fairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based SR models but with significantly less complexity.

Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Range Attention*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 6.

However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

E-Tamba integrates Transformer layers with Mamba layers, achieving competitive language modeling perplexities and downstream NLP task performances while reducing memory usage significantly.\n- **Taipan**, another hybrid model, incorporates Selective Attention Layers (SALs) with Mamba to balance computational efficiency with enhanced long-range modeling capabilities. This approach allows for handling theoretically unlimited context lengths during inference with improved efficiency.\n\n## Key Components and Techniques\n\n- **State Space Duality (SSD)**: Mamba2 introduces SSD, which simplifies the matrix **A** into a scalar, enhancing the adaptability and performance of SSMs. This can be applied in both linear and quadratic forms, making it a valuable component for integrating into Transformer architectures.\n- **Selective Attention**: Taipan's use of SALs to focus attention on a subset of important tokens reduces computational costs while maintaining performance. This selective approach can be integrated into the FastTTTLinear GAU to enhance long-range modeling without increasing computational burden.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: When implementing SSMs, especially for long sequences, ensuring numerical stability is crucial. Techniques such as careful discretization of continuous-time models are essential.\n- **Compatibility with Test-Time Training**: The integration of SSMs should be designed to maintain the test-time training capabilities of the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n\n## Example Implementations\n\n- **SC-MAMBA2**: This model integrates SSMs with a bidirectional modeling approach under the SSM framework, enabling comprehensive analysis of long sequences. While it is applied in single-cell transcriptomics, the underlying principles can be adapted for language modeling.\n- **MambaIR**: Although focused on image restoration, MambaIR demonstrates the effectiveness of Residual State Space Blocks in capturing long-range dependencies. This can serve as a blueprint for adapting SSMs in other domains like language modeling.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo achieve the goal of integrating SSMs with Transformers for efficient long-range sequence modeling, the researcher should focus on:\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combine Transformer layers with SSM layers, as seen in E-Tamba and Taipan, to leverage the strengths of both approaches.\n- **Selective Attention**: Implement SALs to focus attention on critical tokens, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.\n- **State Space Duality**: Utilize SSD to simplify and enhance the performance of SSM components.\n- **Numerical Stability and Compatibility**: Ensure that the integration maintains numerical stability and compatibility with test-time training.\n\nBy following these insights, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that efficiently handles long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 4.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B). Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, and CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n#### 5.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: State Space Transformer Integration, Mamba SSM Architecture, Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. PIDformer: Transformer Meets Control Theory\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer Integration*\n\n*Tam Nguyen, C'esar A. Uribe, Tan M. Nguyen, R. Baraniuk*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel class of transformers is derived, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we address two main shortcomings of transformer architectures: input corruption and rank collapse in their output representation. We unveil self-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes smoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished representation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is sensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers. We empirically evaluate the model for advantages and robustness against baseline transformers across various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer Integration*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer Integration*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba SSM Architecture*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba SSM Architecture*\n\n*Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hybrid model is introduced, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently, and suggests that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. CAB: Comprehensive Attention Benchmarking on Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Jinchao Zhang, Shuyang Jiang, Jiangtao Feng, Lin Zheng, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self,Noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions, and sheds light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved remarkable success in language, image, and speech processing. Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer Integration*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer Integration*\n\n*Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Michael Kopp, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Andreas Auer, Markus Spanring, Korbinian P\u00f6ppel, Maximilian Beck*\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba SSM Architecture*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dual-path RNN: efficient long sequence modeling for time-domain single-channel speech separation\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Zhuo Chen, Yi Luo, Takuya Yoshioka*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in deep learning-based speech separation have proven the superiority of time-domain approaches to conventional time-frequency-based methods. Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain separation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of time steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences. Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling such long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level sequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length. In this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple yet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model extremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller chunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the input length can be made proportional to the square root of the original sequence length in each operation. Experiments show that by replacing 1-D CNN with DPRNN and apply sample-level modeling in the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a new state-of-the-art performance on WSJ0-2mix is achieved with a 20 times smaller model than the previous best system.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the efficiency and performance of the FastTTTLinear GAU (Generalized Autoregressive Unit) by integrating Linear State Space Models (SSMs) to better handle long-range dependencies in sequences, while maintaining computational efficiency and test-time training capabilities.\n\n### Key Insights and Useful Information\n\n#### Integration of SSMs with Transformers\n- The researcher is exploring hybrid architectures that combine SSMs with Transformer models.

These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets.

MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n3 2 2}$ | $\\mathbf{0 . 1 6 3}$ | $\\mathbf{0 . 1 4 2}$ |\n| TSM2-MLP | 0.386 | 0.339 | 0.197 | 0.173 |\n| Mamba + Linear Time | 0.388 | 0.334 | 0.220 | 0.151 |\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nWe present MambaMixer, an efficient selective state space model with dual token and channel selection. MambaMixer uses selective state space models ( S 6 blocks) in both token and channel directions, enabling the model to effectively and selectively fuse information across both of these dimensions. To enhance the information flow and capturing the complex dynamics of features, MambaMixer uses a learnable weighted averaging mechanism on early features, which allows each block to directly access to early features. As proof of concept, we further present ViM2 and TSM2 models based on MambaMixer block for vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our experimental evaluations show that In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models, i.e., ViT, MLPMixer, ConvMixer, and outperforms SSM-based vision models, i.e., ViM and VMamba. In time series forecasting, TSM2 outperforms all the baselines in most datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. ## References\n\nAoki, M.

MambaForGCN: Enhancing Long-Range Dependency with State Space Model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*A. Lawan, Juhua Pu, Haruna Yunusa, Aliyu Umar, Muhammad Lawan*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents MambaForGCN, a novel approach to enhance short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA, which incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment Analysis (ABSA) identifies and evaluates sentiments toward specific aspects of entities within text, providing detailed insights beyond overall sentiment. However, Attention mechanisms and neural network models struggle with syntactic constraints, and the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms hinders their adoption for capturing long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead to the misinterpretation of irrelevant con-textual words, restricting their effectiveness to short-range dependencies. Some studies have investigated merging semantic and syntactic approaches but face challenges in effectively integrating these methods. To address the above problems, we present MambaForGCN, a novel approach to enhance short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This innovative approach incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information. The Multihead Attention (MHA) and Mamba blocks in the MambaFormer module serve as channels to enhance the model with short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words. We also introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) gated fusion, an adaptively integrated feature representation system combining SynGCN and MambaFormer representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate MambaForGCN's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/29 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n274, Aug. 2023, doi: 10.1016/j.knosys. 2023.110648\n[19] A.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 160  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Caduceus: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba Architecture*\n\n*Yair Schiff, Chia-Hsiang Kao, Aaron Gokaslan, Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Volodymyr Kuleshov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and introduces pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale sequence modeling has sparked rapid advances that now extend into biology and genomics. However, modeling genomic sequences introduces challenges such as the need to model long-range token interactions, the effects of upstream and downstream regions of the genome, and the reverse complementarity (RC) of DNA. Here, we propose an architecture motivated by these challenges that builds off the long-range Mamba block, and extends it to a BiMamba component that supports bi-directionality, and to a MambaDNA block that additionally supports RC equivariance. We use MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models. Caduceus outperforms previous long-range models on downstream benchmarks; on a challenging long-range variant effect prediction task, Caduceus exceeds the performance of 10x larger models that do not leverage bi-directionality or equivariance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

FMMformer: Efficient and Flexible Transformer via Decomposed Near-field and Far-field Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling*\n\n*T. Nguyen, Vai Suliafu, S. Osher, Long Chen, Bao Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** FMMformers is a class of efficient and flexible transformers inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method for accelerating interacting particle simulation that can even outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant margin.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose FMMformers, a class of efficient and flexible transformers inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) for accelerating interacting particle simulation. FMM decomposes particle-particle interaction into near-field and far-field components and then performs direct and coarse-grained computation, respectively. Similarly, FMMformers decompose the attention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field attention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix. Computing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in computational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In contrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze and validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the Long Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant margin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of $60.74\\%$ over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better than the standard transformer's average accuracy of $58.70\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

The pitfalls of next-token prediction\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba Architecture*\n\n*Gregor Bachmann, Vaishnavh Nagarajan*\n\n**Abstract:** Can a mere next-token predictor faithfully model human intelligence? We\ncrystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions\nsurrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective.\n  As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of\nnext-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training\n-- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound\nduring autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has\nlearned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more\ndeep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can\nsimply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We\ndescribe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a\nminimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture\nempirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being\nstraightforward to learn.\n  Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved\nusing a simple modification that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope\nthis finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the\nnext-token prediction paradigm.

RecurFormer: Not All Transformer Heads Need Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba Architecture*\n\n*Ruiqing Yan, Linghan Zheng, Xingbo Du, Han Zou, Yufeng Guo, Jianfei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in modeling complex\nlanguage patterns but face significant computational costs during inference,\nespecially with long inputs due to the attention mechanism's memory overhead.\nWe observe that certain attention heads exhibit a distribution where the\nattention weights concentrate on tokens near the query token, termed as recency\naware, which focuses on local and short-range dependencies. Leveraging this\ninsight, we propose RecurFormer, a novel architecture that replaces these\nattention heads with linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically the\nMamba architecture. This replacement reduces the cache size without evicting\ntokens, thus maintaining generation quality. RecurFormer retains the ability to\nmodel long-range dependencies through the remaining attention heads and allows\nfor reusing pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs weights with continual training.\nExperiments demonstrate that RecurFormer matches the original model's\nperformance while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Our approach\nprovides a practical solution to the computational challenges of\nTransformer-based LLMs inference, making it highly attractive for tasks\ninvolving long inputs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-10T15:24:12Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-10T15:24:12Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets.

Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)**, particularly the **Mamba** architecture, into the **FastTTTLinear** GAU, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n## Key Benefits of Mamba Architecture\n\n- **Linear-Time Sequence Modeling**: Mamba models achieve linear scaling in sequence length, which is crucial for efficient long-range dependency modeling without the quadratic cost of traditional attention mechanisms.\n- **Dynamic State Propagation**: Mamba's selective SSMs allow for input-dependent state updates, enabling the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the current token.

The main ideas include introducing grouped-value attention (GVA) head structure, and moving all data-dependent projections to occur in parallel at the beginning of the block. The combination of the modified parallel Mamba block, together with using SSD as the inner SSM layer, results in the Mamba-2 architecture. We investigate Chinchilla scaling laws for Mamba-2 in the same setting as Mamba, finding that it Pareto dominates Mamba and Transformer++ in both perplexity and wall-clock time. We additionally train a family of\n\nMamba-2 models at varying sizes on the Pile, showing that it matches or outperforms Mamba and open source Transformers on standard downstream evaluations. For example, Mamba-2 with 2.7B parameters trained on 300B tokens on the Pile outperforms Mamba-2.8B, Pythia-2.8B and even Pythia-6.9B trained on the same dataset. Systems Optimizations. The SSD framework connects SSMs and Transformers, allowing us to leverage a rich body of work on systems optimizations developed for Transformers (Section 8). - For example, Tensor Parallelism (TP) is an important model parallelism technique to train large Transformer models by splitting each layer across GPUs on the same node. We design Mamba-2 to be TP-friendly, reducing the number of synchronization point per block by half. - For very long sequences whose activations do not fit on one device, sequence parallelism has been developed for the attention blocks. We describe how to train SSMs in general and Mamba-2 in particular with sequence parallelism, by passing the recurrent states between devices. - For finetuning with examples of different lengths, for best efficiency, Transformer requires sophisticated techniques to remove padding tokens and perform attention on variable length sequences. We show how Mamba-2 can be trained with variable sequence lengths efficiently, requiring no padding tokens. Section 9 empirically validates Mamba-2 on language modeling, training efficiency, and a difficult multi-query associative recall task (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024). Finally, in Section 10, we provide an extended related work and discuss potential research directions opened up by our framework.

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a 1-dimensional sequence $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top}$ through an implicit latent state $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, N)}$. A general discrete form of structured SSMs takes the form of equation (1). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A h_{t-1}+B x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A_{t} h_{t-1}+B_{t} x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C_{t}^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, N)}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}$. Structured SSMs are so named because the $A$ matrix controlling the temporal dynamics must be structured in order to compute this sequence-to-sequence transformation efficiently enough to be used in deep neural networks. The original structures introduced were diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022) and diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which remains the most popular structure. In this work, we use the term state space model (SSM) to refer to structured SSMs. There are many flavors of such SSMs, with deep ties to several major paradigms of neural sequence models such as continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). We provide a brief overview below, and refer to prior work for more context and details (Gu 2023; Gu and Dao 2023). Continuous-time Models. The original structured SSMs originated as continuous-time maps on functions $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto$ $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, rather than operating directly on sequences. In the continuous-time perspective, in equation (1a) the matrices $(A, B)$ are not directly learned but generated from underlying parameters $(\\AA, B)$, along with a parameterized step size $\\Delta$. The \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, \\AA, B)$ are converted to \"discrete parameters\" $(A, B)$ through fixed formulas $A=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\AA)$ and $B=f_{B}(\\Delta, B)$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Remark 1. While our main models adopt the same parameterization and discretization step as prior work (see Gu and Dao (2023) for details), for simplifying exposition and notation we omit it in the rest of this paper. We note that prior work on\nstructured SSMs referred to the continuous parameters $(\\AA$, have changed notation to simplify the presentation and focus directly on the discrete parameters, which govern the main SSM recurrence. Recurrent Models. Equations (1) and (2) take the form of a recurrence which is linear in its input $x$. Structured SSMs can therefore be viewed as types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the linearity endows them with additional properties and allows them to avoid the sequential computation of traditional RNNs. Conversely, despite this simplification, SSMs are still fully expressive as sequence transformations (in the sense of universal approximation) (Kaul 2020; Orvieto et al. 2023; Shida Wang and Xue 2023). Convolutional Models. When the SSM's dynamics are constant through time as in equation (1), the model is called linear time-invariant (LTI). In this case, they are equivalent to convolutions. Thus, SSMs can also be viewed as types of CNNs, but where (i) the convolution kernels are implicitly parameterized through the SSM parameters $(A, B, C)$ and (ii) the convolution kernels are generally global instead of local. Conversely, through classical signal processing theory all sufficiently well-behaved convolutions can be represented as SSMs. Commonly, previous LTI SSMs would use the convolutional mode for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (1) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one step at a time). Selective State Space Models. The form (2) where the parameters $(A, B, C)$ can also vary in time was introduced in Mamba as the selective SSM. Compared to the standard LTI formulation (1), this model can selectively choose to focus on or ignore inputs at every timestep. It was shown to perform much better than LTI SSMs on information-dense data such as language, especially as its state size N increases allowing for more information capacity. However, it can only be computed in recurrent instead of convolutional mode, and requires a careful hardware-aware implementation to be efficient. Even so, it is still less efficient than hardware-friendly models such as CNNs and Transformers because it does not leverage matrix multiplication units, which modern accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are specialized for. While time-invariant SSMs are closely related to continuous, recurrent, and convolutional sequence models, they are not directly related to attention. In this paper, we show a deeper relationship between selective SSMs and attention, and use it to significantly improve the training speed of SSMs while simultaneously allowing for much larger state sizes N . ## Structured SSMs as Sequence Transformations. Definition 2.1. We use the term sequence transformation to refer to a parameterized map on sequences $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ where $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ and $\\theta$ is an arbitrary collection of parameters. T represents the sequence or time axis; subscripts index into the first dimension, e.g. $X_{t}, Y_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P}$. Sequence transformations (e.g. SSMs, or self-attention) are the cornerstone of deep sequence models, where they are incorporated into neural network architectures (e.g. Transformers). The SSM in (1) or (2) is a sequence transformation with $P=1$; it can be generalized to $P>1$ by simply broadcasting across this dimension (in other words, viewing the input as $P$ independent sequences and applying the SSM to each). One can think of $P$ as a head dimension, which we will elaborate on in Section 7. Definition 2.2. We define the SSM operator $\\operatorname{SSM}(A, B, C)=\\operatorname{SSM}\\left(A_{0: T}, B_{0: T}, C_{0: T}\\right)$ as the sequence transformation $X \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})} \\mapsto Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ defined by equation (2). In SSMs, the $N$ dimension is a free parameter called the state size or state dimension. We also call it the state expansion factor, because it expands the size of the input/output by a factor of $N$, with implications for the computational efficiency of these models. Finally, we remark that many types of sequence transformations, such as attention, can be represented as a single matrix multiplication across the sequence dimension. Definition 2.3. We call a sequence transformation $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ a matrix transformation if it can be written in the form $Y=M_{\\theta} X$ where $M$ is a matrix depending on the parameters $\\theta$. We identify the sequence transformation with the matrix $M$, and often drop the dependence on $\\theta$ when clear from context. ### 2.2 Attention\n\nAttention broadly refers to a type of computation that assigns scores to every pair of positions in a sequence, allowing each element to \"attend\" to the rest. By far the most common and important variant of attention is softmax self-attention, which can be defined as\n\n$$\nY=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V\n$$\n\nfor $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, \\mathrm{P})}$. The mechanism of pairwise comparisons (induced by materializing $Q K^{\\top}$ ) leads to the characteristic quadratic training cost of attention. Many variants of attention have been proposed, but all share the underlying core of these attention scores, with various approximations (Tay et al. 2022). The most important variant for this work is linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Roughly speaking, this family of methods drops the softmax by folding it into a kernel feature map, and uses associativity of matrix multiplication to rewrite $\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V=Q \\cdot\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)$. Moreover, in the important case of causal (autoregressive) attention, they show that when the causal mask is incorporated into the left-hand side as $\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V$, where $L$ is the lower-triangular 1's matrix, then the right-hand side can be expanded as a recurrence.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis confirms recent findings at smaller scales (Park et al. 2024). In particular, we highlight the difficulty pure SSM models face with the standard five-shot MMLU (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020) and two-shot Phonebook tasks. For the former, after training for 1.1 T tokens, both Mamba and Mamba-2 models produce nearly 15 points lower accuracy when compared to a Transformer model on this task. While the MMLU accuracy gap is partially addressed by training with more tokens (e.g., 3.5T tokens), SSM models still lag behind Transformer models for this common benchmark. We find that Phonebook and standard long-context benchmark tasks remain challenging for SSM models regardless of the number of training tokens. Based on the above findings, we study in detail the potential for hybrid SSM-Transformer models to overcome the challenges faced by pure SSM architectures while retaining (some of) their inferencetime benefits. Similar to Lieber et al. 2024, we focus on LLMs consisting of a mixture of Mamba-2, self-attention, and MLP layers. Our ablation experiments aiming to identify the best hybrid model architecture lead us to design an 8B-parameter Mamba-2-Hybrid with 24 Mamba-2 layers, 4 self-attention layers, and 28 MLP layers. The self-attention and MLP layers are evenly distributed throughout the model. Extensive evaluations of this architecture show that it matches or exceeds Transformers on common natural language evaluations. When training for 3.5 T tokens, a Mamba-2-Hybrid model exceeds a corresponding Transformer on all 12 short-context benchmarks we evaluated. On MMLU, the hybrid model reaches a five-shot accuracy 3.5 points higher than the Transformer. We also study long-context extensions of Mamba-2-Hybrid and the corresponding Transformer to support 16 K and 32 K context lengths. On 23 long-context evaluations, the 16 K and 32 K models closely match or exceed the Transformer baselines on average. Our results show that the hybrid models are particularly good at retrieving, tracking, and aggregating information over long contexts. We highlight three multi-document question answering tasks, however, which challenged the long-context hybrid models. We discuss potential reasons for these results and highlight areas of future work related to\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_b92355d6bd48fca7f050g-03.jpg?height=744&width=1491&top_left_y=190&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 1: Mamba and Mamba-2 blocks with tensor model parallel size two. Mamba requires two all-reduces per layer while Mamba-2 requires only one. More details can be found in Dao and Gu 2024. extending hybrid SSM-Transformer models to long sequence lengths. Finally we highlight that, due to our use of global attention without any explicit position encoding in these models, long-context Mamba-2-Hybrid models can generalize beyond their trained sequence length. This is in contrast with recent hybrid models that use windowed attention and exhibit accuracy degradation on contexts larger than the window size but less than the pretraining sequence length (De et al. 2024). We find that a Mamba-2-Hybrid extended to support 128 K contexts can perform the Phonebook lookup task perfectly even when the phone book contains more than 150 K tokens. We present our findings above to highlight the promise for larger-scale SSM-based models to provide faster, more efficient language model inference without compromising training efficiency or model accuracy compared to Transformers. We hope that by releasing these results, the community is further excited by the potential of Mamba-based LLMs. To help enable further adoption, we release the code used to train our Mamba, Mamba-2, and Mamba-2-Hybrid hybrid models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM library (https:// github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). We also release the model weights for our Mamba-2 8B and Mamba-2-Hybrid 8B on Hugging Face. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we discuss briefly our implementation of SSM layers in Megatron-LM and discuss the training data and evaluations used throughout this report. ### 2.1 Model Implementation\n\nTo support efficient large-scale training, we implement Mamba and Mamba-2 layers with support for tensor (Shoeybi et al. 2019), sequence (Korthikanti et al. 2022), and pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al. 2021) (only for Mamba-2). As described in Dao and Gu 2024, tensor-parallel support for Mamba layers requires two all-reduces per block compared to just one all-reduce for Transformer layers (Figure 1), leading to increased communication overheads for training larger-scale Mamba models. Mamba-2 tensor parallel support, on the other hand, requires only one all-reduce per layer, but requires the use of GroupNorm rather than LayerNorm for the internal block normalization (see Figure 1). We found that using GroupNorm lead to no difference in validation loss when compared to using full LayerNorm as long as the group size (the model hidden dimension divided by the number of groups) is sufficiently large to allow for accurate calculations of the per-group normalization statistics (in our\nexperience this meant a group size greater than 256). To implement SSM-Transformer hybrid models, we combine our Mamba or Mamba-2 layers with the existing self-attention and MLP layers supported in Megatron-LM. These layers support all the previously mentioned parallelization strategies enabling us to immediately train hybrid models with tensor, sequence, and pipeline parallelism. ### 2.2 Training Data\n\nWe train the models discussed in this report on 1.1 T and 3.5 T token datasets. Both datasets are predecessors of the dataset used to train Nemotron-4 and are comprised of $70 \\%$ English, $15 \\%$ non-English, and $15 \\%$ code. For additional details, refer to the discussion included in the Nemotron- 4 technical report (Parmar et al. 2024). We use a vocabulary of 256 K tokens trained with SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson 2018). ### 2.3 Evaluation Tasks and Setup\n\nWe now discuss the evaluations used throughout the paper. Wherever possible, we use open-source LLM benchmark suites to ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible. We report results using a large number of common tasks:\n\n- Standard Short-Context Tasks: We use the open-source LM Evaluation Harness library (commit 94cc1850) (L. Gao et al. 2023) to evaluate the following 12 tasks (metric used for evaluation reported in parentheses): WinoGrande (accuracy) (Sakaguchi et al. 2021), PIQA (accuracy) (Bisk et al. 2020), HellaSwag (normalized accuracy) (Zellers et al. 2019), ARCEasy and ARC-Challenge (accuracy and normalized accuracy) (Clark et al. 2018), MMLU (accuracy) (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020), OpenBookQA (normalized accuracy) (Mihaylov et al. 2018), TruthFulQA (accuracy) (Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2021), PubMedQA (accuracy) (Jin et al. 2019), and RACE (accuracy) (Lai et al. 2017). Each of the proceeding tasks are evaluated by measuring the probability returned by the model for each possible answer choice. We also use the generation-based tasks Natural Questions (NQ) (exact match) (Lee, Chang, and Toutanova 2019) and SquadV2 (F1) (Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018). - Natural Long-Context Tasks: To evaluate long-context models, as above, we use three tasks from LM Evaluation Harness: NarrativeQA (F1) (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Key Insights and Benefits of Mamba and SSMs\n\n### Dynamic State Propagation and Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n- Mamba models use selective SSMs, which update states based on the input, allowing efficient capture of long-range dependencies. This is crucial for tasks involving long sequences and aligns with the goal of enhancing long-range dependency modeling in the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n\n### Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n- Mamba achieves linear scaling in sequence length, addressing the quadratic computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms in Transformers. This property is essential for improving computational efficiency in the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n\n### Compatibility with Attention Mechanisms\n- Hybrid models like **MambaFormer** and **Samba** demonstrate that integrating Mamba with attention mechanisms can leverage the strengths of both architectures. This suggests a potential strategy for integrating selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear, possibly alongside Gated Linear Attention (GLA).\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n### Local Modification Strategy\n- Focus on modifying specific components within the FastTTTLinear GAU, such as replacing or augmenting the linear attention mechanism with selective SSM layers. This approach ensures minimal disruption to the overall architecture while leveraging the benefits of SSMs.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Models like **Samba**, which combines Mamba with Sliding Window Attention, and **RecurFormer**, which replaces certain attention heads with Mamba-based linear RNNs, show that hybrid approaches can enhance performance and efficiency. These examples provide valuable insights for integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Numerical Stability\n- Integrating SSMs requires careful attention to numerical stability, especially for long sequences. Techniques from works like **MambaLRP** can inform strategies to maintain stability.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Training\n- Leveraging hardware-efficient training methods, as discussed in **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**, ensures optimized performance on modern hardware. This is crucial for maintaining computational efficiency in the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n\n### Preserving Expressiveness and Adaptability\n- Ensuring that the dynamic state propagation capabilities of SSMs are preserved during integration is crucial for achieving the desired performance improvements. The selective nature of Mamba allows it to adapt to varying input content, which can improve performance across diverse tasks and datasets.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Future Steps\n\n### Integration Complexity\n- Integrating selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear may introduce complexity due to differences in state management and update mechanisms. Adopting a modular design and incrementally integrating components can mitigate this complexity and facilitate testing.\n\n### Maintaining Test-Time Training (TTT) Capabilities\n- Aligning the selective state updates of SSMs with FastTTTLinear's TTT procedures is essential. Careful design of the state update functions to be compatible with test-time training is necessary.\n\n### Hyperparameter Tuning\n- Introducing SSM components brings additional hyperparameters. Systematic tuning and adopting strategies from Mamba implementations can help in finding optimal settings.\n\n## Most Useful References\n\n1. **Mamba in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**:\n   - This work highlights the efficiency and scalability of Mamba in handling long sequences and its potential to replace Transformers without compromising performance.

Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Bo Liu, Rui Wang, Lemeng Wu, Yihao Feng, Peter Stone, Qian Liu*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective, and shows that these models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The most fundamental capability of modern AI methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability to predict the next token in a long sequence of tokens, known as ``sequence modeling.\"Although the Transformers model is the current dominant approach to sequence modeling, its quadratic computational cost with respect to sequence length is a significant drawback. State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Itamar Zimerman, Ameen Ali, Lior Wolf*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A unified view of attention-free layers of Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs is presented, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers and providing a direct means for applying explainability methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient sequence modeling have led to attention-free layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, all featuring sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length and excellent scaling properties, enabling the construction of a new type of foundation models. In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/24 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n6 0}$ | $\\mathbf{8 6 . 4 0}$ | $\\mathbf{6 2 . 5 1}$ |\n\nPerturbation Tests To assess the faithfulness of explanations, we adopted an input perturbation scheme similar to [11, 10]. This method involves systematically masking image pixels based on their predicted relevance from the explanation method. We conducted two experiments: positive and negative perturbation. (1) Positive Perturbation: in this setup, a good explanation prioritizes relevant pixels. We expect the model's accuracy (specifically, top-1 accuracy) to gradually decrease as we mask pixels in descending order of relevance (most relevant first). (2) Negative Perturbation: Conversely, a robust explanation should maintain model accuracy even when irrelevant pixels are masked. Here, we mask pixels in ascending order of relevance (least relevant first). In both scenarios, we evaluate the explanation quality using the Area-Under-Curve (AUC) metric. AUC considers the model's accuracy as a function of the percentage of masked pixels (ranging from $10 \\%$ to $90 \\%$ ). The perturbations results are summarized in Table 2 for various explanation methods under both positive and negative perturbation scenarios on the ImageNet validation set. In the positive perturbation scenario, where lower AUC values indicate better performance, our proposed Mamba's attention method consistently outperforms the other methods. Specifically, our method achieves the lowest AUC values across all explanation methods, with an AUC of 13.264 for Raw-Attention, 12.830 for Attn-Rollout, and a notably low 11.350 for Attribution. In the negative perturbation scenario, where higher AUC values are better, our method shows the best performance, with AUC values of 47.705 for Raw-Attention, 50.035 for Attn-Rollout, and 51.310 for Attribution, outperforming both the method of [2] and the counterpart XAI methods for Vision Transformer. Perturbation experiments for the NLP domain can be found in Appendix C. In these settings, we fine-tune various LLMs with an additional linear layer classifier and append the [CLS] token to all samples to generate explanation maps, similar to methods used in vision models. These results also demonstrate that our attention formulation surpasses the previous formulation proposed by [2] over the mamba model and is effective also for the RWKV model. Ablation study The architectures we explored implicitly parametrize attention matrices through a composition of several different sub-layers, see Eq 9 , and 15 . Examples of these sub-layers include linear recurrent layers, gate mechanisms, and other components, such as token-shift or depth-wise convolutions. To better understand the contribution of each of these components, we\n\nTable 2: Positive and Negative perturbation AUC results (percentages) for the predicted class on the ImageNet validation set.

Initially, in Fig 5. we visualize the implicit attention of Mamba, ablating the Conv1D or the gate branch, or focusing solely on the S6 layer. As expected, it seems that the Conv1D layer causes a smoothing effect, and the final Mamba implicit attention is significantly sharper than that of the S6 matrices. In Tab3, we compare several ablation variants of our method. As can be seen, our method, which utilizes all the components of Mamba, achieves a much better score than the ablated versions, illustrating the importance of all components. This experiment reveals that including the Conv1D layer is crucial for high performance. However, the activation has a relatively low impact on the implicit representation. A similar ablation study was conducted for RWKV and presented in Appendix C. It is evident that including the gate branch, as presented in our method, consistently improves performance.

Our unified framework facilitates the exploration of similarities and differences among non-attention layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and Griffin, and their interconnections with transformer architectures. Additionally, it enables the development of innovative explainability techniques for the latest attention-free architectures. Our contributions provide the research community with new tools for analyzing the performance, fairness, and robustness of gated-linear RNN variants, while also identifying their potential vulnerabilities. These advancements set the stage for future improvements and support the implementation of weakly supervised downstream tasks. Looking ahead, we aim to incorporate additional layers, such as Hyena [44], and HGRN2 [46] into our framework, including their vision-specific variants [16, 18, 66, 51]. Furthermore, we plan to examine how differences in these architectures are reflected in their self-attention matrices and explore whether such insights can reveal more about the inductive biases inherent in each architecture. ## 6 Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Tel Aviv University Center for AI and Data Science (TAD).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Score: 0.81)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode. These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the TTTLinear GAU and incorporates concepts from the RWKV architecture, here are the key points and useful information:\n\n## Novelty Assessment\nThe researcher needs to determine if the proposed integration is novel.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode. These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Spectral State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Naman Agarwal, Daniel Suo, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Selective State Space Models\" \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Selective State Space Models\" \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Linearizing Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Selective State Space Models\" \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Jean Mercat, Igor Vasiljevic, Sedrick Keh, Kushal Arora, Achal Dave, Adrien Gaidon, Thomas Kollar*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear transformers have emerged as a subquadratic-time alternative to\nsoftmax attention and have garnered significant interest due to their\nfixed-size recurrent state that lowers inference cost. However, their original\nformulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched\ntransformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to\naddress these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating\narchitectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data\nand compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is\nlimited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a\ncost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose\nScalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to\nuptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong\npre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring\n5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to\ncompetitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent\nin-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest\nlinear models.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Selective State Space Models\" \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations\nof linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention\nimplementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that\nenable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when\ngenerating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Here are the key aspects of the researcher's goal and intent:\n\n## Integration of Advanced Concepts\n- The proposal involves integrating **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**, concepts from the **RWKV architecture**, and test-time training mechanisms similar to **TTTLinear GAUs**. This integration is intended to enhance computational efficiency, scalability, and the model's adaptability and expressiveness.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA):** This introduces data-dependent gates that modulate attention weights, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity.\n- **RWKV Architecture:** This involves stateful representations using Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) recurrences, which can be seen as the ratio of two State Space Models (SSMs).\n- **Test-Time Training:** This allows the model to adapt during inference to varying input contexts, a feature from TTTLinear GAUs.\n\n## Objectives\n- Achieve linear computational complexity.\n- Enhance efficiency and scalability for long sequences.\n- Maintain or improve accuracy and robustness.\n- Ensure compatibility and stability in training and inference.\n\n### Useful Information to Achieve the Goal\n\n#### Feasibility and Potential Benefits\n- The integration of GLA with RWKV-inspired stateful representations is theoretically feasible and can lead to significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. GLA can replace standard attention mechanisms, and RWKV's stateful representations can enhance efficiency.\n\n#### Compatibility and Implementation Challenges\n- Careful design is necessary to ensure that the gating mechanisms in GLA work seamlessly with the stateful updates from RWKV and the test-time training steps from TTTLinear. This includes managing numerical stability and training dynamics, which can be challenging due to the combination of gating, statefulness, and test-time adaptation.\n\n#### Alignment with Current Research Trends\n- The proposal aligns with current trends towards efficient architectures that handle long sequences, such as linear attention mechanisms and SSMs. Incorporating test-time training capabilities and stateful representations reflects emerging interests in adaptive and efficient models.\n\n#### Relevant References and Concepts\n\n- **Mamba and Mamba-2:** These models integrate selective SSMs with efficient algorithms, achieving fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. However, they do not explicitly combine GLA with TTTLinear or RWKV concepts.\n- **RWKV:** This architecture uses linear attention mechanisms and stateful representations but does not involve GLA or test-time training. It provides insights into how stateful models can be designed efficiently.\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers:** These models introduce data-dependent gates that enhance expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity. They do not specifically integrate with TTTLinear GAUs or RWKV-inspired mechanisms.\n\n#### Empirical Results and Best Practices\n- The researcher should look for empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness or challenges of integrating GLA with stateful models and test-time training. For example, the study by You et al. (2024) shows that augmented linearized LLMs can achieve significant reductions in perplexity and speedup during generation, which could be relevant when combining with GLA and RWKV concepts.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n#### Conduct Additional Searches\n- Use refined keywords such as \"Gated Linear Attention,\" \"Selective State Space Models,\" and \"RWKV architecture\" to find recent works that may be relevant.\n- Perform internal library searches for design proposals or implementations that combine GLA with stateful models inspired by RWKV or Mamba architectures and test-time training mechanisms.\n\n#### Analyze New Information\n- Examine newly found references for similarities or potential overlaps with the current proposal.\n- Investigate empirical results, reported challenges, or limitations in integrating GLA with stateful models and test-time training.\n\n#### Finalize Novelty Assessment\n- Determine definitively whether the proposal offers a novel contribution compared to existing research and previous design proposals.\n\nBy following these steps and focusing on the integration of GLA, RWKV-inspired stateful representations, and test-time training, the researcher can develop a novel LM block that addresses the current limitations in efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of existing models.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

A Faster and Better Large Language Model with Improved TransNormer (Avg.

Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** TransNormerLLM is presented, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency and develops a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** We present TransNormerLLM, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

While attention mechanisms like those used in Transformers provide powerful modeling capabilities, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting their scalability. The FastTTTLinear GAU addresses computational efficiency by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and RWKV-inspired stateful representations, achieving linear time and space complexity. However, there is room for improvement in modeling long-range dependencies and expressiveness.\n\nSelective State Space Models (SSMs), particularly those employed in the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling long sequences with linear computational complexity. By dynamically adjusting state propagation based on input content, selective SSMs enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\nThe motivation behind **EfficientSelectiveFastTTT** is to integrate selective SSMs into the FastTTTLinear GAU, thereby enhancing long-range dependency modeling while maintaining test-time training capabilities and computational efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### FastTTTLinear GAU\n\n- **FastTTTLinear** integrates Gated Linear Attention and RWKV-inspired stateful representations to achieve linear complexity and efficient state management.\n- **Limitations**: While efficient, FastTTTLinear may lack expressiveness in capturing long-range dependencies due to its reliance on linear attention mechanisms alone.\n\n### Mamba Architecture and Selective State Space Models\n\n- **Mamba** introduces selective SSMs where state updates are input-dependent, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information.\n- **Advantages**: Enhances the ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently, with linear computational complexity.\n- **Success in Multiple Domains**: Has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in language modeling, audio processing, and other modalities.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n\n- **MambaFormer and Samba**: Combine Mamba with attention mechanisms, showing that hybrid models can leverage the strengths of both architectures.\n- **Relevance**: Suggests that integrating selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear could enhance performance.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with FastTTTLinear\n\n1. **Limited Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: While efficient, FastTTTLinear may not capture long-range dependencies as effectively as desired.\n2. **Expressiveness**: Linear attention mechanisms may lack the expressiveness needed for complex sequential patterns.\n3. **Scalability**: There's potential to further improve scalability without compromising computational efficiency.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nIntegrate selective SSMs inspired by the Mamba architecture into the FastTTTLinear GAU to:\n\n- **Enhance Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: By dynamically adjusting state propagation, the model can capture long-range dependencies more effectively.\n- **Maintain Computational Efficiency**: Preserve the linear time and space complexity of FastTTTLinear.\n- **Preserve Test-Time Training Capabilities**: Ensure compatibility with the test-time training mechanisms of FastTTTLinear.\n- **Improve Expressiveness**: Increase the model's ability to represent complex sequential patterns through selective state updates.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n- **Selective State Propagation**: By making state updates input-dependent, the model can focus on relevant information and discard irrelevant details, improving long-range modeling.\n- **Linear Complexity**: Selective SSMs maintain linear computational complexity, aligning with the efficiency goals of FastTTTLinear.\n- **Compatibility with TTT**: Careful design of the state update functions ensures that test-time training capabilities are preserved.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nModify the FastTTTLinear GAU by:\n\n1. **Integrating Selective State Space Model Components**: Replace or augment the linear attention mechanism with a selective SSM layer inspired by Mamba.\n2. **Input-Dependent State Updates**: Implement state updates that are functions of the input, allowing selective propagation or forgetting of information.\n3. **Ensuring Compatibility with TTT**: Design the state update mechanism to work seamlessly with the test-time training capabilities of FastTTTLinear.\n4. **Preserving Computational Efficiency**: Utilize efficient algorithms and hardware-aware optimizations to maintain linear complexity.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.

For example, leverage `torch.cumsum` or other efficient operations.\n\n4. **Ensure Compatibility with TTT**\n\n   - Store the hidden states (`h_prev`) in the `Z` dictionary, allowing them to be updated during test-time training.\n   - Ensure gradients flow appropriately through the state updates.\n\n5. **Maintain Computational Efficiency**\n\n   - Optimize the implementation to avoid unnecessary memory usage.\n   - Leverage batch operations and hardware acceleration where possible.\n\n6. **Normalize Outputs**\n\n   - Use `RMSNorm` or another suitable normalization layer to maintain numerical stability.\n\n7. **Integration into the Model**\n\n   - Update the model's block instantiation to use `EfficientSelectiveFastTTT` instead of `FastTTTLinear`.\n   - Verify that input and output dimensions match those expected by the surrounding layers.\n\n### Mathematical Considerations\n\n- **Stability**:\n\n  - Activation functions and normalization help maintain numerical stability in the recurrent computations.\n\n- **Gradient Flow**:\n\n  - Ensure that backpropagation through time is correctly handled, and gradients are not vanishing or exploding.\n\n- **Computational Complexity**:\n\n  - The implementation should have time complexity \\( O(L) \\) where \\( L \\) is the sequence length.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed **EfficientSelectiveFastTTT** GAU enhances the FastTTTLinear by integrating selective state space models inspired by the Mamba architecture. This modification improves the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies through input-dependent state updates while maintaining test-time training capabilities and computational efficiency. By preserving linear time and space complexity and ensuring compatibility with existing mechanisms, this design offers a practical and effective solution to the limitations of current linear attention mechanisms in FastTTTLinear. The integration of selective SSMs is expected to result in improved performance on tasks involving long sequences, better scalability, and enhanced adaptability to diverse inputs.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Gu, A., & Dao, T.
