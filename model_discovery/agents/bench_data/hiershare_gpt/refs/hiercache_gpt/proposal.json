Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like TransformerXL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAiningfree Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer-based models (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) have achieved remarkable performance over the past few years. The key component of these model architectures is the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). However, the original attention design struggles to efficiently handle long sequences, which becomes particularly problematic in scenarios such as document-level translation (Werlen et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019) and large-scale text generation (Zhou et al., 2023), as its time and space computation costs increase quadratically with the sequence length (Tay et al., 2022). The primary factor for this elevated computational complexity can be traced back to the multiplication between queries and keys used in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_5c47e93541490f812b5fg-1.jpg?height=543&width=780&top_left_y=731&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: Two memory selection methods: For oracle, it selects memories with the highest attention scores after computing $Q K^{\\top}$. For TRAMS, it selects important $\\mathrm{key} / \\mathrm{value}$ pairs that are independent of queries based on our self-defined metric before computing $Q K^{\\top}$. the attention module. In general, the time complexity for calculation is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2} d\\right)$ if a transformer model with $d$ dimensions is set up with an input consisting of $N$ tokens. To tackle this computation bottleneck, numerous efforts have been made. The first line of work is to find a new efficient expression to compute the attention score. Despite the advancements made, these methods often compromise performance, thus paving the way for alternative solutions. Efficient architectures that provide an approximate expression of attention have been explored widely (Wang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2022b,a; Choromanski et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022b,a). The second line of work is to keep the calculation expression the same and use an external structure like hash function (Kitaev et al., 2019; Daras et al., 2020), clustering (Roy et al., 2021; Vyas et al., 2020) and memory selector (Pietruszka et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2019; Bertsch et al., 2023; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, 2019; Child et al., 2019) to find the suitable subset of queries and keys in the long sequence for attention calculation. Our work falls into the second category, in which we propose a training-free memory selection mechanism to select suitable tokens for attention computation. Specifically, we focus on pushing Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) architecture to a better position by selecting higher-quality tokens inside its memory. Based on our initial investigation, we construct a memory subset by selecting $50 \\%$ of the memories with the largest attention values and maintaining the same performance.\n```\n\n#### 2. DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba (Avg. Score: 0.66)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/27 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nYutao Sun, Li Dong, Barun Patra, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Xia Song, and Furu Wei. 2022.

Score: 0.55)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.26)\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Y. Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/34 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\n(Left) Memory Usage Comparison. (Right) Cumulative Time Comparison. only a vector. Measuring this empirically in comparable models, we found that Transformers used $3,152,384$ parameters. In contrast, the equivalent Aarens used 3, 152, 896 parameters, representing only a marginal $\\sim 0.016 \\%$ parameter increase - a minor trade-off for the significant gains in memory and time complexities. ## 5 Related Work\n\nClosest to Aaren are approximations of attention such as those by RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). These models proposed linearizations of the standard softmax-based attention that allow them to be formulated as an RNN. However, in doing so, these models also encode an exponential factor that biases tokens based on their timestamp, limiting their potential applications. In contrast, Aaren leverages an exact re-formulation of softmax attention as an RNN, allowing the model itself to compute the weight of each token. Feng et al. (2023) showed attention can be computed recurrently, using it to compress set-based inputs. Rabe and Staats (2022) introduced a recurrent formulation of attention, showing that self-attention can be computed efficiently. Katharopoulos et al. (2020) showed that Transformers with a causal mask can be viewed as an RNN. In contrast, we (1) show a more general result whereas any attention model can be viewed as an RNN. Furthermore, we (2) introduce Aaren, a new attention formulation based on parallel prefix sums, that achieves competitive results with that of Transformers while being more efficient. The problem of computing prefix scans/sums has been well studied with various efficient parallelized algorithms proposed for computing them. Since Aaren only requires the output of the prefix scan, any efficient algorithm for computing it can be used. In this work, we outlined the method by Hillis and Steele (1986). This method is time efficient for parallel computation, requiring $\\log _{2}(N)$ sequential steps and $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log (N))$ overall computation. In contrast, the method by Ladner and Fischer (1980) use mores sequential steps (specifically, $2 \\log _{2}(N)-2$ ) but only performs $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ overall computation. For a more in-depth introduction to parallel prefix sums algorithms, we refer the reader to the following work by Blelloch (1990). In this work, we applied Transformers to a subset of applications. For a broad overview of the applications of Transformers, we refer the reader to the following survey by Islam et al. (2023). For an overview of different transformer models applied to the specific settings considered in this paper, we refer the reader to the following surveys (1) on transformers in reinforcement learning by Li et al. (2023) and (2) on transformers in event forecasting, time series forecasting, time series classification, and more by Wen et al. (2022). ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we showed that attention can be formulated as an RNN whereas the conventional way of computing attention is a parallelized method of computing its many-to-one RNN output. Building on the RNN formulation, we showed that existing attention-based models can be formulated as RNNs. However, unlike traditional RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, these methods cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens. Addressing this, we introduced a new parallelized method of computing attention's many-to-many RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we introduced Aaren, a new module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be efficiently updated at inference time, thereby requiring only constant memory (like RNNs). Empirically, we showed that Aarens achieve performance competitive with Transformers on 38 datasets spread across four sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting. Finally, we empirically show that Aarens are significantly more time and memory-efficient than Transformers. ## References\n\nAgarwal, P., Rahman, A. A., St-Charles, P.-L., Prince, S.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Generating Distractors for Reading Comprehension Questions from Real\n  Examinations\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yifan Gao, Lidong Bing, Piji Li, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the task of distractor generation for multiple choice reading\ncomprehension questions from examinations. In contrast to all previous works,\nwe do not aim at preparing words or short phrases distractors, instead, we\nendeavor to generate longer and semantic-rich distractors which are closer to\ndistractors in real reading comprehension from examinations. Taking a reading\ncomprehension article, a pair of question and its correct option as input, our\ngoal is to generate several distractors which are somehow related to the\nanswer, consistent with the semantic context of the question and have some\ntrace in the article. We propose a hierarchical encoder-decoder framework with\nstatic and dynamic attention mechanisms to tackle this task. Specifically, the\ndynamic attention can combine sentence-level and word-level attention varying\nat each recurrent time step to generate a more readable sequence.

EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

Hybrid intelligence for dynamic job-shop scheduling with deep reinforcement learning and attention mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention mechanisms*\n\n*Bo Yuan, Xiu Li, Rong Wang, Yuanzhi Dai, Zijun Liao, Yunhui Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a class of scheduling tasks that specifically consider the inherent uncertainties such as changing order requirements and possible machine breakdown in realistic smart manufacturing settings. Since traditional methods cannot dynamically generate effective scheduling strategies in face of the disturbance of environments, we formulate the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement learning (RL). For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most appropriate dispatching rule. Furthermore, we present Gymjsp, a public benchmark based on the well-known OR-Library, to provide a standardized off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in the hybrid framework.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. DRAGNN: A Transition-based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ivan Bogatyy, Lingpeng Kong, David Weiss, Chris Alberti, Daniel Andor*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing novel\nrecurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the\nTransition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer\nactivations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections\nto be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By\nconnecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used\narchitectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and\nre-cursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an encoder for\ndownstream tasks and as a decoder for its own task simultaneously, resulting in\nmore accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent\nAcyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN. We show that DRAGNN is\nsignificantly more accurate and efficient than seq2seq with attention for\nsyntactic dependency parsing and yields more accurate multi-task learning for\nextractive summarization tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory-efficient transformer architectures, dynamic attention mechanisms, hardware optimization techniques, and token selection methods, here are some key insights and implementations from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Parallel Layer Execution\nMemory-efficient bidirectional transformers can utilize parallel layer execution, inspired by architectures like PaLM, which reduces training time by approximately 15% and optimizes resource utilization.\n\n### Efficient Architectures\nModels like Informer, Autoformer, and FEDformer offer lower complexity compared to traditional transformers. For example, FEDformer has a complexity of O(L), which is more efficient than the O(L^2) complexity of traditional transformers.\n\n### Adaptive Quantization\nThe use of adaptive quantization methods, such as the Adaptive Absolute Percentile (AAP) Linear layers, can improve the model\u2019s efficiency by achieving ternary weight representation. This approach is particularly beneficial in reducing memory footprint and computational complexity.\n\n## Dynamic Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Self-Attention Mechanism\nThe self-attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to dynamically adjust its focus on different parts of the input sequence. This is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies and global context.\n\n### Head Partitioning Self Attention (HPSA)\nHPSA is a novel self-attention mechanism that divides attention heads into two groups: first-ring and second-ring message passing. This division enhances efficiency by introducing a graph-structure inductive bias and reducing computational complexity.\n\n### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)\nGQA uses an intermediate number of key-value heads, achieving quality close to multi-head attention while being comparable in speed to multi-query attention. This method is efficient and can be upscaled from existing checkpoints[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer models. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing power consumption and latency. For example, a memristor-based scaled dot-product attention acceleration can achieve a power consumption of \\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\) and a latency of \\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\).\n\n### Optimized Key-Value Cache Mechanism\nAn optimized key-value cache mechanism can accelerate inference time by reducing the need for repeated computations and minimizing data dependencies. This is particularly useful in models where attention patterns are complex and need to be computed efficiently.\n\n## Token Selection Methods\n\n### Training-Free Memory Selection\nThe TRAMS approach allows for the selection of tokens for attention based on simple metrics, keeping tokens likely to have high attention scores without additional training or parameters. This method improves efficiency by selectively processing tokens that are most relevant[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Selective Computation\nGeometric gating in attention mechanisms, as seen in the \"geogate_gpt\" design, can be improved by incorporating selective computation techniques. This involves focusing computational resources on tokens that are most relevant to the current context, reducing unnecessary computations[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Balanced Efficiency and Expressiveness\nThere is a need for a better balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Hybrid approaches combining different techniques, such as geometric gating, rotary position embedding, and grouped-query attention, can help achieve this balance[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n### Integrated Memory-Attention Approach\nTreating memory and attention as integrated components rather than separate ones can lead to more efficient memory allocation based on attention patterns. This integrated approach can optimize information retention and reduce memory usage[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that address the challenges of memory management, dynamic attention, hardware optimization, and token selection.\n",

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.54)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 4 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: cascaded attention mechanisms, hardware optimization attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Beyond Self-attention: External Attention using Two Linear Layers for Visual Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: cascaded attention mechanisms*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Tai-Jiang Mu, Zheng-Ning Liu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms, especially self-attention, have played an increasingly important role in deep feature representation for visual tasks. Self-attention updates the feature at each position by computing a weighted sum of features using pair-wise affinities across all positions to capture the long-range dependency within a single sample. However, self-attention has quadratic complexity and ignores potential correlation between different samples. This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism which we call external attention, based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two normalization layers; it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing popular architectures. External attention has linear complexity and implicitly considers the correlations between all data samples. We further incorporate the multi-head mechanism into external attention to provide an all-MLP architecture, external attention MLP (EAMLP), for image classification. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, image generation, and point cloud analysis reveal that our method provides results comparable or superior to the self-attention mechanism and some of its variants, with much lower computational and memory costs.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: cascaded attention mechanisms*\n\n*Wancai Zhang, Hui Xiong, JianXin Li, Shuai Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shanghang Zhang, Haoyi Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention*\n\n*Jian Ren, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Kamyar Salahi, Georgios Evangelidis, Yang Wen, Ju Hu, Yanyu Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. This work demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance even with MobileNet-level size and speed.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on cascaded attention mechanisms and hardware optimization techniques, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis notes:\n\n## Cascaded Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Multiresolution Cascaded Attention\nThe Multiresolution Cascaded Attention U-Net (MCAU-Net) model provides a useful example of cascaded attention mechanisms. In this model, a cascaded channel and spatial attention framework is employed to enhance feature representation. This approach integrates both channel and spatial attention maps, which can be adapted for language models to improve the utilization of pertinent features and contextual information.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanism\nThe lightweight hybrid attention mechanism, such as the MCAttention mechanism, processes multiple feature information (e.g., channel information) to capture high-level feature information and dependencies between features. This can be translated to language models by using similar hybrid attention mechanisms to process different aspects of the input sequence, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex dependencies.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n### SeerAttention Mechanism\nThe SeerAttention mechanism is particularly noteworthy for its hardware-specific optimizations. It introduces a learnable gating module (Attention Gate) that identifies block-wise attention sparsity, allowing for the use of a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel. This significantly reduces I/O and computation overhead, achieving a speedup of 5.47\u00d7 compared to FlashAttention-2 at a sequence length of 128k with 90% sparsity. This approach is optimized for modern hardware like GPUs and can be integrated with tiling computation schemes, making it highly efficient.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Design\nThe Tiny-Transfer-Learning (TinyTL) approach, although primarily aimed at on-device learning, highlights the importance of memory-efficient design. By freezing weights and learning only bias modules, TinyTL reduces memory overhead significantly. For language models, similar techniques can be applied to optimize memory usage, especially when combined with other memory-efficient strategies like hierarchical memory architectures and dynamic context pruning.\n\n## Memory-Compute Trade-offs\n\n### Block-Sparse Attention\nSeerAttention's use of block-sparse attention kernels illustrates a effective memory-compute trade-off. By learning block-wise attention sparsity, the model reduces the computational and memory overhead without significant accuracy loss. This approach can be generalized to other cascaded attention mechanisms to balance memory and compute resources efficiently.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Architectures\nThe analysis notes mention hierarchical memory architectures for efficient context management. This approach can be combined with cascaded attention mechanisms to ensure that the model efficiently manages memory while maintaining or improving performance. Hierarchical structures can help in distributing the memory load and optimizing the information flow within the model[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration with Other Optimization Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Token Selection and Pruning\nIntegrating cascaded attention mechanisms with dynamic token selection and pruning techniques can further enhance efficiency. For example, dynamic context pruning can reduce up to 80% of the context without significant performance degradation. When combined with cascaded attention, this can lead to a more efficient and scalable model design[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\nThe integration of multiple optimization techniques, such as top-k attention, ring attention, and hierarchical memory architectures, requires careful orchestration to ensure hardware-aware design. This involves balancing memory and compute resources, leveraging blockwise computation for better parallelization, and optimizing for specific hardware like GPUs[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design:\n\n- **Cascaded Attention Mechanisms**: Implement multiresolution and hybrid attention mechanisms to enhance feature representation and capture complex dependencies.\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Use block-sparse attention kernels like SeerAttention to reduce I/O and computation overhead.\n- **Memory-Compute Trade-offs**: Balance memory and compute resources through block-sparse attention and hierarchical memory architectures.\n- **Integration with Other Optimization Techniques**: Combine cascaded attention with dynamic token selection, pruning, and other memory-efficient strategies to achieve a highly efficient and scalable model design.\n",

We can then rewrite the formula for softmax attention in Equation (1) as\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\frac{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right) \\boldsymbol{v}_{j}}{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{j}\\right)}{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere every query attends to every past key in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{2}\\right)$ time and space complexity. Furthermore, Katharopoulos et al. 24] show that linear attention has a fixed size recurrent state during generation. Letting $\\boldsymbol{s}_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{j}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{\\top}$ be a \"KV-state\" and \"K-state\" respectively, we can compute Equation (2) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{s}_{i-1}+\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{i}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{z}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{z}_{i-1}+\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\boldsymbol{s}_{i}}{\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right) \\boldsymbol{z}_{i}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{s}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times \\tilde{d}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{d}}$. Feature map. To approximate $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$, we use the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor series feature map, picking $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)=1+\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}+\\frac{\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nWhile Zhang et al. 13 note that picking a feature map with $\\tilde{d}=d^{2}$ results in linear attention with $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity and large recurrent state of size $O\\left(d^{3}\\right)$, we can tradeoff efficiency for recall capacity by projecting queries and keys to smaller dimensions i.e., $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d^{\\prime}}$ with $d^{\\prime}=16$. By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/72 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3 b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make Based competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable $24 \\times$ higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe choice of sequence mixer (e.g. attention, convolution) in a language model affects both its quality and efficiency [1, 2. Prior work shows that attention excels at recall, the ability to ground generations in previously seen tokens [1, 3]. On the other hand, the throughput of attention-based models is bottle-necked during training by quadratic compute complexity and during inference by aggressive memory consumption. The natural question is: can we improve the real-world speed and memory-use of language models without comprising on quality? Recently, a number of architectures have been proposed that enable substantially higher throughput while matching attention in perplexity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, coarse metrics like overall perplexity can obscure important differences in model quality. For example, recent work shows that a specific class of architectures, gated-convolutions, despite complexity scaling sub-quadratically in sequence length, are less efficient than\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-02.jpg?height=420&width=1620&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=247)\n\nFigure 1: Based overview. Combining linear attention with tiny sliding window softmax attention (e.g., 64 or 128 tokens in width) enables improved recall accuracy with limited efficiency overhead vs. smaller tile sizes.

(Center) Model recall accuracy ( $y$ ) vs. sliding window attention size $(x)$. We compare linear attention alone (dark blue), sliding window attention alone (light blue), and their combination (BASED, orange). (Right) Schematic diagram of BASED illustrating how the two components complement each other. attention at performing recall 1]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broader class of architectures across real-world recall-intensive tasks and show attention improves over the best attention-free alternative, Mamba, by 46.7 accuracy points (Table 1). ${ }^{1}$\n\nMotivated by these observations, we explore the pareto frontier of the tradeoff between high-recall and high-throughput models. We evaluate a range of architectures (e.g. attention, SSMs, and convolutions) on a popular synthetic associative recall task [1, 3, 9, Since generation throughput is bottle-necked by memory consumption, we vary hyperparameters (e.g. model dimension) that affect the size of the recurrent state during generation and demonstrate a fundamental recall-memory tradeoff that holds across architecture classes (Figure 2). Attention performs associative recall perfectly, but the recurrent state (i.e. the KV-cache) grows linearly with the sequence length. Sliding window attention can cap the size of the recurrent state at the cost of worse long-range recall 10 . However, Mamba, a recently proposed SSM architecture expands the Pareto frontier beyond sliding window. This begs the question: are there other, perhaps simpler, models that can also expand the pareto frontier? To reduce the memory consumption, we consider using two simple techniques: sliding window attention and softmax-approximating linear attention. Our results on language modeling (Table 1) and synthetic recall experiments (Figure 1, center) suggest neither primitive alone suffices to navigate the Pareto frontier. 1. We find that linear attention alone struggles to solve associative recall (Figure 1, center). We hypothesize that this is because linear attention lacks the precision to perform local token shifts and comparisons [1, 9. 2. In sliding window attention, associative recall range is limited by the width of the windows (Figure 1, center). As we increase the window size, the recurrent state grows linearly and has a non-linear affect on speed during parallel training and inference (Figure 1 , left). We combine these two techniques into a single architecture, which we call BASED (Figure 1, right). We find that sliding window attention and linear attention complement each other, enabling BASED to expand the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff (Figure 22. We suspect that (1) the large recurrent memory of linear attention could help model long-range token interactions in the sequence and (2) sliding window attention handles the precise local shifts needed to perform associative recall. To make BASED competitive with SoTA attention 11] and recurrent [5 models under wall-clock and throughput metrics, we introduce several IO-aware optimizations. 1. Despite the theoretically improved complexity, linear attention implementations are often slower than well-optimized attention implementations 12 . In BASED, we use the 2nd-order Taylor approximation of softmax as the linear attention feature map With sequence length $N$ and head dimension $d$, this\n\n[^1]na\u00efvely requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity [13, 14].\n```\n\n#### 2. Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/32 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIt is worth noting that their complexity is essentially quadratic, and the corresponding linear versions both suffer performance degradation (see Fig. 1 left). While it is true that the simple use of a chunk linearization strategy can rival the speed of SSMs, the drop in performance is significant. We, therefore, abandon this strategy and the softmax function to accelerate the linear attention operations of the kernel-based approach. In addition, long convolution (Fu et al., 2023b) is more efficient and easier to implement than the traditional SSMs. We believe combining these two modules could release the true power of the hybrid model with faster speed and better performance. However, the existence of such a dilemma is worth considering: (1) the linear attention in hybrid models is a speed bottleneck for long convolution, the comparison is shown in Fig. 1 right; (2) the instability of long convolution makes attention hard to optimize. Specifically, due to the intense memory access (I/O) on the GPU and cumulative summation (cumsum) operation in a casual setting,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-02.jpg?height=550&width=1454&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=300)\n\nFigure 1. Demonstration of (left) comparison of various popular models on the Long Range Arena Dataset, and (right) speed benchmark on different implementations of attentions. Figure left, despite showing promising performance of SSM-Attention models, the linear version of these models degenerated. Figure right benchmarks attention speed with around 200 M parameters, showing linear attention is not linear with sequence length and is significantly slower than S 4 , which can be a speed bottleneck in these hybrid designs. the notable reduction in complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ in linear attention is only theoretical (Qin et al., 2024); On the other hand, the long convolution needs hand-crafted regularizations to prevent over-fitting high-frequency noise. To escape the dilemma, we have developed a novel model called CHELA, which stands for short-long Convolutional with Hardware-Efficient $\\underline{\\text { Linear }} \\underline{\\text { Attention. This model is }}$ designed to effectively and efficiently capture complex dependencies in long inputs. Inspired by FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), the model comprises multiple layers of real linear token mixers with hardware-friendly implementation with a gating mechanism that achieves comparable performance to full attention. We have added a stabilizer, reparameterizable (Ding et al., 2022; 2023) short-long convolutions, to the bottom layer of the long convolution to integrate multiple frequencies with inputs. As a result, the top layers of CHELA capture more refined data-dependent information using linear attention, while the convolutions add a structural bias that enhances global abstraction in multi-level frequencies. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CHELA on various datasets and tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020b), which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, CHELA is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer but also yields better performance. In all the settings, CHELA outperforms the baselines. Finally, we provide further analysis and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness. Our contribution can be summarized in three folds:\n\n- Efficient Implementation: We release the potential speed of linear attention in the attention-ssm hybrid model, maintaining a constant rate regardless of sequence length with fixed memory. - New Design: We improve multi-frequency learning with multi-level convolutional hierarchies, leading to better performance and stability for long convolution. - Promising Results: By connecting the above two basic modules, we propose CHELA for efficient long sequence learners are capable of both global information abstraction and fine-grained data-dependent selection.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid attention mechanisms, memory efficient feature maps\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Hybrid intelligence for dynamic job-shop scheduling with deep reinforcement learning and attention mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms*\n\n*Bo Yuan, Xiu Li, Rong Wang, Yuanzhi Dai, Zijun Liao, Yunhui Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a class of scheduling tasks that specifically consider the inherent uncertainties such as changing order requirements and possible machine breakdown in realistic smart manufacturing settings. Since traditional methods cannot dynamically generate effective scheduling strategies in face of the disturbance of environments, we formulate the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement learning (RL). For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most appropriate dispatching rule. Furthermore, we present Gymjsp, a public benchmark based on the well-known OR-Library, to provide a standardized off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in the hybrid framework.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Hybrid Attention Mechanism for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms*\n\n*Richard Radke, Chengjiang Long, Ashraful Islam*\n\n**Abstract:** Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging vision task due to the absence of ground-truth temporal locations of actions in the training videos. With only video-level supervision during training, most existing methods rely on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework to predict the start and end frame of each action category in a video. However, the existing MIL-based approach has a major limitation of only capturing the most discriminative frames of an action, ignoring the full extent of an activity. Moreover, these methods cannot model background activity effectively, which plays an important role in localizing foreground activities. In this paper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention mechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to address these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an auxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background activity by introducing an \"action-ness\" score for each video snippet. Moreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two attention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less discriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2% mAP at IoU threshold 0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset, and by at least 1.3% mAP at IoU threshold 0.75 on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset.

Additionally, we propose an efficient Bottleneck-LSTM layer that\nsignificantly reduces computational cost compared to regular LSTMs. Our network\nachieves temporal awareness by using Bottleneck-LSTMs to refine and propagate\nfeature maps across frames. This approach is substantially faster than existing\ndetection methods in video, outperforming the fastest single-frame models in\nmodel size and computational cost while attaining accuracy comparable to much\nmore expensive single-frame models on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset. Our model\nreaches a real-time inference speed of up to 15 FPS on a mobile CPU.\n\n**Conference:** mobile-video-object-detection-with-temporally-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-11-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient feature maps*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format. Code and models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/EfficientViT.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hybrid attention mechanisms and memory-efficient feature maps, here are some key insights and strategies derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Different Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n### Hybrid Attention Separable Block (HASB)\nThe HASB, as described in the Hybrid Attention Separable Network (HASN) for image super-resolution, combines channel attention and spatial attention. This hybrid approach leverages the complementary advantages of both attention mechanisms, enhancing feature extraction capabilities without significantly increasing computational load or parameters.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanism in MedVisionLlama\nThis mechanism combines efficient attention (capturing global dependencies) and channel attention (refining feature representations by focusing on different channels). This balance between global and local feature learning is crucial for enhancing the feature extraction process and can be adapted for language models to improve contextual understanding and efficiency.\n\n### Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Attention\nThe HASTF model for EEG-based emotion recognition uses a hybrid attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal attention. This approach can be generalized to other domains, such as language models, to capture both spatial (or contextual) and temporal (or sequential) dependencies effectively.\n\n## Feature Map Design Choices\n\n### Efficient Feature Extraction\nUsing depthwise separable convolutions instead of standard convolutions, as in HASN, can significantly reduce computational load and the number of parameters while maintaining strong feature extraction capabilities. This strategy can be applied to language models by optimizing the feature extraction modules within the attention mechanisms.\n\n### Multi-Scale Fusion\nThe MedVisionLlama model uses a Multi-Scale Fusion Block to aggregate features across various scales, enriching the representation with multi-scale contextual information. A similar approach can be applied to language models to capture features at different scales or contexts, enhancing the model's ability to understand complex sequences.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n### Reduced Residual Connections\nIn HASN, using only a few necessary residual connections prevents the vanishing gradient problem while reducing the model's storage and computational cost. This strategy can be applied to language models to minimize unnecessary residual connections and optimize memory usage.\n\n### Top-k Attention Mechanisms\nTop-k attention mechanisms, mentioned in the analysis, reduce memory usage by selectively focusing on the most relevant elements. This can be integrated into hybrid attention architectures to optimize memory efficiency without compromising performance[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Architectures\nHierarchical memory architectures with efficient context management can help in managing memory efficiently. This involves organizing memory in a hierarchical manner to reduce the overhead of context switching and improve overall efficiency[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n## Integration with Hardware Optimizations\n\n### Tensor Core-Aware Implementations\nOptimizing attention mechanisms to utilize tensor cores, as mentioned in the analysis, can significantly improve computational efficiency. This involves designing attention mechanisms that are aware of the hardware capabilities, such as using small window sizes with tensor core awareness[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms\nIO-aware algorithms are crucial for practical efficiency, especially in large-scale language models. Ensuring that the attention mechanisms and feature map designs are optimized for input/output operations can lead to improved throughput and reduced latency[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n### Linear Attention Variants\nLinear attention variants, such as those in Lightning Attention-2, can achieve theoretical computational benefits while maintaining consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length. Integrating such linear attention mechanisms into hybrid architectures can enhance both efficiency and performance[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are not only highly performant but also memory-efficient and optimized for hardware capabilities. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n- **Hybrid Attention**: Combine different attention mechanisms (e.g., channel, spatial, efficient) to leverage their complementary advantages.\n- **Feature Map Optimization**: Use depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to enhance feature extraction while reducing computational load.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Implement top-k attention mechanisms, reduce unnecessary residual connections, and use hierarchical memory architectures.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Design attention mechanisms that are tensor core-aware and IO-aware to maximize computational efficiency.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving the goal of improving autoregressive language model design by balancing performance, memory efficiency, and hardware optimization.\n",

Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with $5 x$ fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinearly combining information using contentbased weights, a method generically known as attention, is a key building block in many deep neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Luong et al., 2015), convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Bello et al., 2019) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) (Velickovic et al., 2018). One particular type of such attention, called multi-head scaled dot-product attention, is one of the main components of the Transformer architecture proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017), which has been shown to push the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for various understanding and generation tasks. These include standard natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, document classification, entailment, summarization and question answering (Zaheer et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019; Baevski and Auli, 2019), as well as music generation (Huang et al., 2018), image generation (Parmar et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020) and genomics (Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020). The Transformer is also the backbone architecture for models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) (and its numerous relatives) and GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which have delivered impressive performance across many NLP tasks. However, the standard attention mechanism of the Transformer has a run time and memory usage that scales quadratically with sequence length. Therefore, this quadratic complexity has become a critical bottleneck in processing long sequences (over 1,000 tokens), and has since motivated many new attention algorithms, see (Tay et al., 2020d) for a survey of such work. In this paper, we draw inspiration from two branches in numerical analysis: Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000) and Multigrid method (Briggs et al., 2000). We propose a hierarchical attention that has linear complexity in run time and memory, and only utilizes dense linear algebra operations optimized for GPUs or TPUs. We hypothesize that the inductive bias embodied by the proposed hierarchical structure for the attention matrix is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typically seen in many natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The main benchmark we use in this paper is the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020c), which has been specifically designed to evaluate and compare various sub-quadratic attention algorithms. Our new hierarchical attention mechanism achieves best average performance to-date on the LRA benchmark by more than 6 points over the previous-best BigBird algorithm (Zaheer et al., 2020), while pushing SOTA performance higher\nin 4 of the 5 successful tasks. Furthermore, using this new attention, a Transformer-based language model trained on the One-Billion Word dataset (Chelba et al., 2014) sets a new SOTA performance record by reducing the test perplexity by 1.55 points comparing to the previousbest Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) with 5x more parameters. Overall, these empirical results both validate the soundness of our approximation method for computing attention weights, as well as the the appropriateness of the inductive bias present in the proposed hierarchical attention. ## 2 Related Works\n\nIt is well established in the NLP literature that the embeddings of nearby tokens tend to be more similar than the distant ones (Manning and Sch\u00fctze, 1999). This leads to the intuition that token similarity and hence the attention should decrease with the sequence distance between a query token and a key token ${ }^{1}$. This motivates the sliding-window local attention (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019) which amounts to truncating off-diagonal entries in the attention matrix beyond a user-specified sequence distance. A second approach is to keep $O(1)$ number of nonzeros per row in the attention matrix. The nonzero entry selection is either content-based (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020), handcrafted (Beltagy et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019) or simply random (Zaheer et al., 2020). It is also well known in the NLP literature that long-range contextual information is necessary for many NLP tasks (Khandelwal et al., 2018; Liu and Lapata, 2019). So a set of global tokens are also considered. This adds $O(1)$ number of dense rows and columns to the attention matrix (Zaheer et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). A third approach is to approximate the attention matrix with a lowrank factored form (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a). The first two approaches are based on the premise that one needs to explicitly zero out entries in the attention matrix in order to reduce the quadratic complexity. Decades of\n\n[^0]research by the scientific computing and numerical analysis community has resulted in more sophisticated algorithms to sparsify matrices. A small set of samples of these algorithms and their engineering applications include Fast Multipole Method (Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987; Greengard, 1994; Nabors et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1998), Pre-corrected FFT (Phillips and White, 1997; Zhu et al., 2005), Hierarchical Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Kapur and Long, 1997) and Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000; Zhu and White, 2005). These are generally called Multilevel Methods (Brandt and Lubrecht, 1990). The hierarchical attention proposed in this paper is inspired by these Multilevel Methods in general and the H-Matrix in particular. The hierarchical matrix structure allows a linear complexity in both constructing and applying the attention matrix. ## 3 Definition and Notation\n\nGiven matrices $Q, K$ and $V$, with rows representing sequences of token embedding or feature vectors for query, key and value respectively, the output weighted by the scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is defined as\n\n$$\nZ=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $Z, Q, K, V \\in R^{L \\times d}, L$ is the length of the sequences, and $d$ is the embedding or feature size. In a more compact matrix form, Eq. (1) can be written as\n\n$$\nZ=D^{-1} A V\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA & =e^{S} \\\\\nS_{i, j} & =\\frac{Q_{i} K_{j}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}} \\\\\nD & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left\\{A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}\\right\\} \\\\\n1_{L} & =[1,1, \\ldots, 1]^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $A, S \\in R^{L \\times L}, \\mathbf{1}_{L} \\in R^{L}$ is a vector with all ones, and $S_{i, j}$ represents the unnormalized cosine similarity between query embedding $Q_{i}$ (the $i$-th row in $Q$ ) and key embedding $K_{j}$ (the $j$-th row in $K)$. For the sake of clarity, we focus on the singlehead attention in the exposition of the proposed\nalgorithm. Extension to the multi-head case is straightforward since each attention head is computed independently (Vaswani et al., 2017). Computing the similarity matrix $S$ in Eq. (4) and the attention matrix $A$ in Eq. (3) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ memory. Similarly, computing $A V$ in Eq. (2) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time, and computing $A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}$ in Eq. (5) takes $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ time. The $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexities are the bottlenecks for applying the attention mechanism over very long sequences. ## 4 Introduction on H-Matrix and Multigrid Method\n\n### 4.1 H-Matrix\n\nThe singular-value decomposition of the attention matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2.

It is important to note that during inference when leveraging the Key-Value ( $\\mathrm{K}-\\mathrm{V}$ ) cache, the process for local attention layers deviates from Algorithm 1.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Attention with Bounded-memory Control (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Hao Peng, Jungo Kasai, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Zhaofeng Wu, Lingpeng Kong, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/39 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n4. \u00a7B. 2 presents a detailed derivation. Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n#### 5. Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling (Avg.

Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an efficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon previous methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size; (2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference speed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which improves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments show the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and for pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the cache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and show improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning tasks.

Interpretable Structure-aware Document Encoders with Hierarchical\n  Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Khalil Mrini, Claudiu Musat, Michael Baeriswyl, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a method to create document representations that reflect their\ninternal structure. We modify Tree-LSTMs to hierarchically merge basic elements\nsuch as words and sentences into blocks of increasing complexity. Our Structure\nTree-LSTM implements a hierarchical attention mechanism over individual\ncomponents and combinations thereof. We thus emphasize the usefulness of\nTree-LSTMs for texts larger than a sentence. We show that structure-aware\nencoders can be used to improve the performance of document classification. We\ndemonstrate that our method is resilient to changes to the basic building\nblocks, as it performs well with both sentence and word embeddings. The\nStructure Tree-LSTM outperforms all the baselines on two datasets by leveraging\nstructural clues. We show our model's interpretability by visualizing how our\nmodel distributes attention inside a document. On a third dataset from the\nmedical domain, our model achieves competitive performance with the state of\nthe art.

Fake News Detection on News-Oriented Heterogeneous Information Networks\n  through Hierarchical Graph Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yuxiang Ren, Jiawei Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The viral spread of fake news has caused great social harm, making fake news\ndetection an urgent task. Current fake news detection methods rely heavily on\ntext information by learning the extracted news content or writing style of\ninternal knowledge. However, deliberate rumors can mask writing style,\nbypassing language models and invalidating simple text-based models. In fact,\nnews articles and other related components (such as news creators and news\ntopics) can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN for short).\nIn this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, namely\nHierarchical Graph Attention Network(HGAT), which uses a novel hierarchical\nattention mechanism to perform node representation learning in HIN, and then\ndetects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments on two\nreal-world fake news datasets show that HGAT can outperform text-based models\nand other network-based models. In addition, the experiment proved the\nexpandability and generalizability of our for graph representation learning and\nother node classification related applications in heterogeneous graphs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-05T19:09:13Z  (*Updated: 2021-02-13T03:16:22Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learnable Multi-level Frequency Decomposition and Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Arjan Kuijper, Florian Kirchbuchner, Naser Damer, Meiling Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increased deployment of face recognition systems in our daily lives, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is attracting much attention and playing a key role in securing face recognition systems. Despite the great performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks (CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain adaption/shift problems. We successfully prove the design of our proposed PAD solution in a step-wise ablation study that involves our proposed learnable frequency decomposition, our hierarchical attention module design, and the used loss function.

Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ali Farhadi, Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Aniruddha Kembhavi*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context\nparagraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the\nquery. Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC.\nTypically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the\ncontext and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions\ntemporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we\nintroduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage\nhierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of\ngranularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a\nquery-aware context representation without early summarization.

FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models with a Single GPU\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization attention*\n\n*Ce Zhang, Ion Stoica, Christopher R\u00e9, Percy Liang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at Inference Time\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization attention*\n\n*Hua Wu, dianhai yu, Yu Sun, Shuohuan Wang, Tingwen Liu, Zhenyu Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Junyuan Shang, Guoxia Wang, Yilong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using hierarchical attention mechanisms and cache optimization strategies, here are some key insights and implementations that can be considered:\n\n### Different Hierarchical Attention Architectures\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN):**\n   HANs are designed to capture the hierarchical structure of data, such as documents or sentences. They use two levels of attention: word-level and sentence-level. This dual attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of words within sentences and sentences within documents, which can be particularly useful in natural language processing tasks.\n\n2. **Nova's Hierarchical Self-Attention:**\n   Nova uses a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to learn the low-information-density semantics in long sequences of assembly code. This mechanism captures semantics at three granularity levels, including per-statement attention labels and inter-instruction attention for long dependencies. This approach can be adapted for language models to handle long-range dependencies effectively.\n\n3. **LiGAR's Cross-Modal Guided Attention:**\n   The LiGAR framework employs a hierarchical transformer architecture with a cross-modal guided attention mechanism. This mechanism uses features from one modality (e.g., LiDAR) to enhance representations from other modalities (e.g., video and text). This hierarchical and multi-modal approach can be adapted to language models to enhance the processing of complex contextual information.\n\n### Cache Management Techniques and Memory Hierarchy Utilization\n\n1. **Memory-Efficient Attention Algorithms:**\n   Research has shown that attention mechanisms can be optimized to require O(1) memory with respect to sequence length, which is crucial for modern accelerators where device memory is often the limiting factor. Techniques such as selective computation through gating mechanisms and cache-aware implementations can significantly improve efficiency.\n\n2. **Feature Map Design Choices:**\n   The design of feature maps can significantly impact the efficiency and expressiveness of the model. For example, Taylor series feature maps can expand the recurrent state size without changing the number of parameters, providing a good balance between efficiency and expressiveness. Simple feature maps like ReLU and ELU can also be effective alternatives.\n\n3. **IO-Aware Algorithms:**\n   IO-aware algorithms are crucial for practical efficiency. Strategies such as using small window sizes (16-64) optimal for tensor cores and careful balancing in hybrid approaches can help in managing the memory hierarchy effectively.\n\n### Integration with Existing Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Hybrid Attention Architecture:**\n   Combining different types of attention mechanisms (e.g., local and global attention, linear and non-linear attention) can provide complementary benefits. For instance, global attention can capture long-range dependencies, while local attention can focus on detailed local features. Integrating these mechanisms can help in achieving a better balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n\n2. **Dynamic Attention Weights:**\n   Multi-modal attention models use dynamic attention weights to adapt to different contexts within the data. This approach can be integrated into hierarchical attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features and align different modalities effectively.\n\n### Cache Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Hardware-Aware Implementations:**\n   Implementations that are aware of the hardware constraints, such as tensor core utilization strategies, can significantly optimize cache management. For example, using small window sizes and careful memory management can help in reducing the memory footprint and improving the overall efficiency of the model.\n\n2. **Selective Computation:**\n   Techniques like selective computation through gating mechanisms can help in reducing unnecessary computations and optimizing cache usage. This approach ensures that the model only processes the most relevant information, thereby improving efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these hierarchical attention mechanisms, optimizing cache management, and utilizing the memory hierarchy effectively, researchers can develop more efficient and expressive autoregressive language models that balance performance and efficiency.\n",

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture. We support our insights with empirical results from more than 25,000 trained models.

Building Blocks for a Complex-Valued Transformer Architecture (Avg.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Why Spectral Normalization Stabilizes GANs: Analysis and Improvements\n\n*From Search Query: normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Giulia Fanti, Zinan Lin, Vyas Sekar*\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral normalization (SN) is a widely-used technique for improving the stability and sample quality of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, there is currently limited understanding of why SN is effective. In this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization. This connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs requires no hyper-parameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, SN preserves this property throughout training. Building on this theoretical understanding, we propose a new spectral normalization technique: Bidirectional Scaled Spectral Normalization (BSSN), which incorporates insights from later improvements to LeCun initialization: Xavier initialization and Kaiming initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSSN gives better gradient control than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that it outperforms SN in sample quality and training stability on several benchmark datasets.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. DeepNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000 Layers\n\n*From Search Query: normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Furu Wei, Dongdong Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to stabilize extremely deep Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a new normalization function (DeepNorm) to modify the residual connection in Transformer, accompanying with theoretically derived initialization. In-depth theoretical analysis shows that model updates can be bounded in a stable way. The proposed method combines the best of two worlds, i.e., good performance of Post-LN and stable training of Pre-LN, making DeepNorm a preferred alternative. We successfully scale Transformers up to 1,000 layers (i.e., 2,500 attention and feed-forward network sublayers) without difficulty, which is one order of magnitude deeper than previous deep Transformers. Remarkably, on a multilingual benchmark with 7,482 translation directions, our 200-layer model with 3.2B parameters significantly outperforms the 48-layer state-of-the-art model with 12B parameters by 5 BLEU points, which indicates a promising scaling direction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding INT4 Quantization for Transformer Models: Latency Speedup, Composability, and Failure Cases\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization case studies*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Zhewei Yao, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Cheng Li, Xiaoxia Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the deployment efficiency of transformer-based language models has been challenging given their high computation and memory cost. While INT8 quantization has recently been shown to be effective in reducing both the memory cost and latency while preserving model accuracy, it remains unclear whether we can leverage INT4 (which doubles peak hardware throughput) to achieve further latency improvement. In this study, we explore the feasibility of employing INT4 weight and activation (W4A4) quantization for language models. Our findings indicate that W4A4 quantization introduces no to negligible accuracy degradation for encoder-only and encoder-decoder models, but causes a significant accuracy drop for decoder-only models. To materialize the performance gain using W4A4, we develop a highly optimized end-to-end W4A4 encoder inference pipeline supporting different quantization strategies. Our INT4 pipeline is $8.5\\times$ faster for latency-oriented scenarios and up to $3\\times$ for throughput-oriented scenarios compared to the inference of FP16, and improves the SOTA BERT INT8 performance from FasterTransformer by up to $1.7\\times$. We provide insights into the failure cases when applying W4A4 to decoder-only models, and further explore the compatibility of INT4 quantization with other compression methods, like pruning and layer reduction.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Pareto-Optimal Quantized ResNet Is Mostly 4-bit\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization case studies*\n\n*Lukasz Lew, Chas Leichner, Oleg Rybakov, Jonathan Malmaud, Shivani Agrawal, Lisa Wang, Amirali Abdolrashidi*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization has become a popular technique to compress neural networks and reduce compute cost, but most prior work focuses on studying quantization without changing the network size. Many real-world applications of neural networks have compute cost and memory budgets, which can be traded off with model quality by changing the number of parameters. In this work, we use ResNet as a case study to systematically investigate the effects of quantization on inference compute cost-quality tradeoff curves. Our results suggest that for each bfloat16 ResNet model, there are quantized models with lower cost and higher accuracy; in other words, the bfloat16 compute cost-quality tradeoff curve is Pareto-dominated by the 4-bit and 8-bit curves, with models primarily quantized to 4-bit yielding the best Pareto curve. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet for 4-bit ResNet-50 with quantization-aware training, obtaining a top-1 eval accuracy of 77.09%. We demonstrate the regularizing effect of quantization by measuring the generalization gap. The quantization method we used is optimized for practicality: It requires little tuning and is designed with hardware capabilities in mind. Our work motivates further research into optimal numeric formats for quantization, as well as the development of machine learning accelerators supporting these formats. As part of this work, we contribute a quantization library written in JAX, which is open-sourced at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/aqt.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on stability, memory optimization, and hierarchical feature integration, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis notes:\n\n## Stability Analysis of Normalization Techniques\n\n- The paper on \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" highlights several techniques to enhance the stability of large language models (LLMs). It discusses the application of layer normalization after QK, Proj, and FC2 layers, as well as combining QK layer normalization with softmax capping. These methods significantly improve training stability and allow for higher learning rates without divergence.\n\n## Memory Optimization Case Studies\n\n- The analysis notes mention the importance of hardware-efficient implementations and cache management strategies. For instance, \"batch normalization computation fusion\" and \"convolutional acceleration algorithm\" in real-time systems demonstrate how to optimize memory access and computation for better performance[Analysis Note].\n- The paper on \"Training and Inference with Integers\" shows how replacing batch normalization with constant scaling layers can simplify components and reduce complexity, which is beneficial for memory optimization and efficient hardware deployment[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Strategies for Hierarchical Features\n\n- Hierarchical feature aggregation is crucial, as seen in the \"Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\" and \"ECAPA-TDNN\" models. These models use hierarchical attention mechanisms and aggregate features from different levels, providing complementary information and improving representation[Analysis Note].\n- For autoregressive language models, integrating hierarchical features could involve using multi-level attention mechanisms or aggregating features from different layers of the transformer architecture.\n\n## Performance Impact of Different Normalization Approaches\n\n- The comparison of various normalization methods in the \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" paper shows that QK layer normalization combined with softmax capping significantly improves model stability and reduces perplexity. This approach allows for higher learning rates and better convergence compared to other methods like Reparam, soft_temp, and LayerScale.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques\n\n- The importance of hardware-aware design is emphasized in the analysis notes. Techniques such as batch normalization fusion, integer-based implementations, and optimizing memory access patterns are crucial for performance improvement[Analysis Note].\n- For autoregressive models, implementing hardware-specific optimizations like those described in \"Training and Inference with Integers\" can help in reducing complexity and improving efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Cache Efficiency Measurements and Memory Access Pattern Optimization\n\n- Efficient cache management is vital, as highlighted by the need for structured patterns to improve cache efficiency. Tiling strategies and balancing complexity with performance are key considerations[Analysis Note].\n- The \"FlashAttention\" paper discusses IO-aware attention mechanisms that optimize memory access patterns, which could be adapted for autoregressive models to improve cache efficiency and reduce memory access costs[Analysis Note].\n\n## Normalization Convergence Analysis\n\n- The convergence analysis in \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" indicates that normalizing the outputs of QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers can help in stabilizing the training process. However, the main reason for divergence is often in the QK layers, suggesting that focusing on these layers is critical.\n\n## Feature Propagation Strategies\n\n- Hierarchical feature propagation, as seen in \"ECAPA-TDNN,\" involves aggregating and propagating features from different hierarchical levels. This can be applied to autoregressive models by ensuring efficient feature propagation between different layers of the transformer architecture[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Normalization Implementations\n\n- Implementing normalization techniques that are aware of hardware constraints, such as using constant scaling layers instead of batch normalization for integer-based implementations, can significantly improve efficiency and performance[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are more stable, memory-efficient, and optimized for hardware performance. Here are some specific recommendations:\n\n- **Use QK layer normalization combined with softmax capping** to improve training stability and allow for higher learning rates.\n- **Implement hardware-aware normalization techniques**, such as batch normalization fusion and integer-based implementations, to optimize for hardware efficiency[Analysis Note].\n- **Optimize memory access patterns** using techniques like tiling strategies and IO-aware attention mechanisms to improve cache efficiency[Analysis Note].\n- **Integrate hierarchical feature aggregation** using multi-level attention mechanisms to improve representation and feature propagation[Analysis Note].\n- **Conduct thorough convergence analysis** focusing on the normalization of QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers to ensure stable training.\n",

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.22)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

Linearizing Large Language Models (Avg.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/63 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nE. Hinton.

Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Image Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*David Wipf, Stefano Soatto, Zheng Zhang, Wei Xia, Yuanjun Xiong, Yongxin Wang, Tianjun Xiao, Tong He, Yifan Xing*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) model that learns how to cluster a set of images into an unknown number of identities using a training set of images annotated with labels belonging to a disjoint set of identities. Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components predicted at each level of the hierarchy to form a new graph at the next level. Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score and 8% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) relative to current GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node densities as intermediate steps of the clustering process. In contrast, our unified framework achieves a seven-fold decrease in computational cost. We release our training and inference code at https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/hilander.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*Arash Vahdat, Jan Kautz*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\\times$256 pixels.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating hierarchical normalization, cache-aware computation, and adaptive scaling, here are some relevant points and references that align with the researcher's intent:\n\n## Hierarchical Feature Aggregation in Normalization Layers\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss hierarchical normalization techniques, the concept of hierarchical feature aggregation can be inferred from models that use hierarchical structures. For example, the hierarchical graph neural network (h-GNN) described in uses a hierarchical approach to preserve both local and global information, which could be adapted to normalization layers by aggregating features at multiple levels.\n\n## Cache-Aware Computation Techniques for Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of cache-aware computation is crucial for efficient neural network design. Although the provided sources do not explicitly discuss cache-aware normalization, the idea of efficient cache utilization can be derived from general cache-aware neural network techniques. For instance, the \"Neurocache\" paper mentioned in the initial analysis (though not directly linked here) focuses on efficient vector retrieval for long-range language modeling, which could inspire cache-aware strategies for normalization layers.\n\n## Multi-Level Adaptive Normalization Methods\n\n- Adaptive normalization methods are key to dynamic feature importance weighting and context-dependent normalization. While the sources provided do not specifically address multi-level adaptive normalization, the transformer architecture discussed in uses a hierarchical structure for action recognition, which involves exploiting both visual and textual features. This hierarchical approach could be adapted to develop multi-level adaptive normalization techniques.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Normalization Implementations\n\n- Efficient hardware implementation is critical for real-world deployment. The hierarchical GNN (h-GNN) in demonstrates how hierarchical structures can be efficiently implemented by successively compressing graphs, which could be a model for designing hardware-efficient normalization layers.\n\n## Memory Access Patterns in Normalization Layers\n\n- Optimizing memory access patterns is essential for cache-aware computation. The h-GNN in discusses message-passing mechanisms that update node representations within and across hierarchical levels, which can provide insights into optimizing memory access patterns for normalization layers.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Sharing in Normalization\n\n- Dynamic parameter sharing can enhance efficiency and stability. The hierarchical action recognition model in uses a joint loss function to train the model for both coarse and fine-grained action recognition, which involves sharing parameters across different levels. This approach could be adapted for dynamic parameter sharing in normalization layers.\n\n## Context-Dependent Normalization Techniques\n\n- Context-dependent normalization is crucial for adaptive scaling. The action recognition model in exploits the hierarchical structure and sequential context of actions, which can be a blueprint for developing context-dependent normalization techniques.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Hierarchical Normalization\n\n- Stability analysis is vital for ensuring the robustness of the model. The study on random fully connected neural networks in discusses the emergence of effective network depth and the impact of depth-to-width ratio on network behavior, which could provide insights into the stability analysis of hierarchical normalization.\n\n## Cache Management Strategies for Neural Networks\n\n- Effective cache management is essential for performance. While the provided sources do not directly address cache management for normalization layers, general strategies for cache-aware neural networks, such as those mentioned in the initial analysis (e.g., \"Neurocache\"), can be applied to develop efficient cache management strategies.\n\n## Adaptive Scaling in Normalization Layers\n\n- Adaptive scaling is important for dynamic feature importance weighting. The hierarchical action recognition model in uses a joint loss function to adaptively learn both coarse and fine-grained actions, which can be a model for adaptive scaling in normalization layers.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Studies on hierarchical organization in complex systems, such as those in, can provide insights into how hierarchical structures can enhance the robustness and efficiency of neural networks.\n- **Efficient Computation**: Techniques like local response normalization (LRN) in, although not hierarchical, demonstrate how normalization can be optimized for better performance and stability.\n\nTo further improve the autoregressive language model design, the researcher should:\n- Investigate existing hierarchical normalization techniques and adapt them for autoregressive models.\n- Develop cache-aware strategies specifically for normalization layers, leveraging insights from cache-aware neural network techniques.\n- Implement multi-level adaptive normalization methods that incorporate context-dependent normalization and dynamic parameter sharing.\n- Optimize memory access patterns and cache management strategies to enhance hardware efficiency.\n- Conduct thorough stability analysis to ensure the robustness of the hierarchical normalization approach.\n",

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/19 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1811.02084, 2018.

LightRW: FPGA Accelerated Graph Dynamic Random Walks\n\n*From Search Query: cache-aware neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph dynamic random walks (GDRWs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph analytics and learning applications, including graph embedding and graph neural networks. Despite the fact that many existing studies optimize the performance of GDRWs on multi-core CPUs, massive random memory accesses and costly synchronizations cause severe resource underutilization, and the processing of GDRWs is usually the key performance bottleneck in many graph applications. This paper studies an alternative architecture, FPGA, to address these issues in GDRWs, as FPGA has the ability of hardware customization so that we are able to explore fine-grained pipeline execution and specialized memory access optimizations. Specifically, we propose LightRW, a novel FPGA-based accelerator for GDRWs. LightRW embraces a series of optimizations to enable fine-grained pipeline execution on the chip and to exploit the massive parallelism of FPGA while significantly reducing memory accesses. As current commonly used sampling methods in GDRWs do not efficiently support fine-grained pipeline execution, we develop a parallelized reservoir sampling method to sample multiple vertices per cycle for efficient pipeline execution. To address the random memory access issues, we propose a degree-aware configurable caching method that buffers hot vertices on-chip to alleviate random memory accesses and a dynamic burst access engine that efficiently retrieves neighbors. Experimental results show that our optimization techniques are able to improve the performance of GDRWs on FPGA significantly. Moreover, LightRW delivers up to 9.55x and 9.10x speedup over the state-of-the-art CPU-based MetaPath and Node2vec random walks, respectively.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Overcoming Recency Bias of Normalization Statistics in Continual Learning: Balance and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Liping Jing, Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Zicheng Sun, Xingxing Zhang, Liyuan Wang, Yilin Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning entails learning a sequence of tasks and balancing their knowledge appropriately. With limited access to old training samples, much of the current work in deep neural networks has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting of old tasks in gradient-based optimization. However, the normalization layers provide an exception, as they are updated interdependently by the gradient and statistics of currently observed training samples, which require specialized strategies to mitigate recency bias. In this work, we focus on the most popular Batch Normalization (BN) and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning. Our analysis demonstrates the dilemma between balance and adaptation of BN statistics for incremental tasks, which potentially affects training stability and generalization. Targeting on these particular challenges, we propose Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages. By implementing BN in a continual learning fashion, our approach achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of benchmarks, particularly for the challenging yet realistic online scenarios (e.g., up to 7.68%, 6.86% and 4.26% on Split CIFAR-10, Split CIFAR-100 and Split Mini-ImageNet, respectively). Our code is available at https://github.com/lvyilin/AdaB2N.\n\n**Conference:** overcoming-recency-bias-of-normalization\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on memory optimization, cache-aware algorithms, stability analysis of adaptive normalization, and other related aspects, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Neural Networks\n- The paper on \"NeuZip: Memory-Efficient Training and Inference with Dynamic Compression of Neural Networks\" introduces a weight compression scheme that reduces the memory footprint of neural networks without sacrificing performance. This method is particularly useful for large models, as it can significantly reduce memory usage during training and inference.\n\n## Cache-Aware Algorithms for Deep Learning\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss cache-aware algorithms for deep learning, the concept of optimizing memory access patterns is crucial. For instance, the \"NeuZip\" paper mentions the importance of managing memory efficiently, including techniques like activation checkpointing to save memory during back-propagation. This implies that optimizing cache usage can be achieved through careful management of memory access patterns and efficient storage of activations.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Adaptive Normalization Methods\n- The \"U-GAT-IT\" paper introduces the AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function, which demonstrates the practical implementation of adaptive normalization. However, the stability analysis of such methods is not explicitly covered in the provided sources. Future research should focus on analyzing the convergence properties and stability of adaptive normalization techniques, such as those used in \"U-GAT-IT\" and \"LaPE\".\n\n## Efficient Implementation of Hierarchical Neural Architectures\n- Hierarchical architectures, such as those described in \"NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder,\" are effective in capturing multi-scale features. This concept can be applied to autoregressive language models by designing hierarchical structures that balance computational overhead with feature expressiveness.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Adaptation in Deep Learning\n- The \"NeuZip\" paper touches on dynamic compression and optimization of neural network parameters, which can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter adaptation. However, for autoregressive models, dynamic parameter sharing strategies, such as those mentioned in the future search plan, need to be explored further to optimize performance and memory usage.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Normalization Techniques\n- The \"LaPE\" paper uses layer-adaptive and hierarchical position embedding with independent layer normalization, which is hardware-efficient. This approach can be adapted to autoregressive models to improve efficiency in normalization layers.\n\n## Analysis of Memory Access Patterns in Neural Networks\n- Efficient memory access patterns are crucial for performance. Techniques like activation checkpointing and dynamic compression, as discussed in the \"NeuZip\" paper, can help optimize memory access and reduce peak memory usage.\n\n## Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation Methods\n- Hierarchical architectures, as mentioned in \"NVAE\" and \"LaPE,\" are effective in capturing multi-scale features. These methods can be integrated into autoregressive language models to improve feature aggregation and expressiveness.\n\n## Cache Utilization Strategies in Deep Learning\n- While not explicitly covered, optimizing cache utilization involves careful management of memory access patterns. Techniques such as activation checkpointing and efficient storage of model parameters, as discussed in \"NeuZip,\" can help in this regard.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nTo further improve autoregressive language model design, the following areas should be explored:\n\n- **Specific Implementations of Cache-Aware Normalization**: Investigate how to integrate cache-aware strategies into normalization layers to optimize memory access patterns.\n- **Stability Analysis of Adaptive Normalization**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the convergence properties and stability of adaptive normalization methods.\n- **Hardware Efficiency in Normalization Layers**: Adapt layer-adaptive and hierarchical normalization techniques to ensure hardware efficiency.\n- **Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation**: Implement hierarchical structures to capture multi-scale features effectively.\n- **Dynamic Parameter Sharing Strategies**: Explore dynamic parameter adaptation to optimize performance and memory usage.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective  (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Yash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, Michael Hahn*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths, and a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power is identified.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/63 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nE. Hinton.

Score: 0.01)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

Real-Time Super-Resolution System of 4K-Video Based on Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*He Li, Yongming Tang, Changjun Song, Chengcheng Wang, Yanpeng Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video super-resolution (VSR) technology excels in reconstructing low-quality video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

Training and Inference with Integers in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Shuang Wu, Luping Shi, Guoqi Li, Feng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Researches on deep neural networks with discrete parameters and their\ndeployment in embedded systems have been active and promising topics. Although\nprevious works have successfully reduced precision in inference, transferring\nboth training and inference processes to low-bitwidth integers has not been\ndemonstrated simultaneously. In this work, we develop a new method termed as\n\"WAGE\" to discretize both training and inference, where weights (W),\nactivations (A), gradients (G) and errors (E) among layers are shifted and\nlinearly constrained to low-bitwidth integers. To perform pure discrete\ndataflow for fixed-point devices, we further replace batch normalization by a\nconstant scaling layer and simplify other components that are arduous for\ninteger implementation. Improved accuracies can be obtained on multiple\ndatasets, which indicates that WAGE somehow acts as a type of regularization.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate the potential to deploy training in hardware\nsystems such as integer-based deep learning accelerators and neuromorphic chips\nwith comparable accuracy and higher energy efficiency, which is crucial to\nfuture AI applications in variable scenarios with transfer and continual\nlearning demands.\n\n**Conference:** training-and-inference-with-integers-in-deep-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature aggregation neural networks*\n\n*Chuan Shi, Xiao Wang, Yanfang Ye, Peng Cui, P. Yu, Houye Ji, Bai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.\n\n**Conference:** heterogeneous-graph-attention-network-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 4. ECAPA-TDNN: Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation and Aggregation in TDNN Based Speaker Verification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature aggregation neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Current speaker verification techniques rely on a neural network to extract\nspeaker representations. The successful x-vector architecture is a Time Delay\nNeural Network (TDNN) that applies statistics pooling to project\nvariable-length utterances into fixed-length speaker characterizing embeddings.\nIn this paper, we propose multiple enhancements to this architecture based on\nrecent trends in the related fields of face verification and computer vision.\nFirstly, the initial frame layers can be restructured into 1-dimensional\nRes2Net modules with impactful skip connections. Similarly to SE-ResNet, we\nintroduce Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in these modules to explicitly model\nchannel interdependencies. The SE block expands the temporal context of the\nframe layer by rescaling the channels according to global properties of the\nrecording. Secondly, neural networks are known to learn hierarchical features,\nwith each layer operating on a different level of complexity. To leverage this\ncomplementary information, we aggregate and propagate features of different\nhierarchical levels. Finally, we improve the statistics pooling module with\nchannel-dependent frame attention. This enables the network to focus on\ndifferent subsets of frames during each of the channel's statistics estimation.\nThe proposed ECAPA-TDNN architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nTDNN based systems on the VoxCeleb test sets and the 2019 VoxCeleb Speaker\nRecognition Challenge.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations, hierarchical feature aggregation, and optimization techniques, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing, which significantly accelerates transformer self-attention operations. This approach optimizes the implementation of normalization layers by leveraging memristor technology, reducing the computational overhead and improving efficiency.\n\n## Hierarchical Feature Aggregation in Deep Learning\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss hierarchical feature aggregation in the context of autoregressive language models, the concept can be inferred from papers on efficient neural network architectures. For instance, the use of hierarchical structures in neural network design, as mentioned in the context of memristor-based transformers, suggests that hierarchical feature aggregation could be optimized through similar hierarchical architectures.\n\n## Cache-Aware Neural Network Architectures\n- The \"FlashAttention\" paper is particularly relevant here, as it introduces an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, making it optimal for a range of SRAM sizes and reducing HBM accesses. This demonstrates successful implementation of cache-aware algorithms in attention mechanisms, which can be applied to autoregressive models[Analysis Note, FlashAttention].\n\n## Memory Access Optimization in Neural Networks\n- The \"Loki\" paper discusses the use of low-rank keys for efficient sparse attention, which reduces data movement and compute costs. This approach highlights the importance of structured access patterns and dimensional reduction in cache management, which can be applied to optimize memory access in autoregressive models[Analysis Note, Loki].\n\n## Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Normalization\n- The \"AdaLomo\" paper provides insights into stable adaptive optimization using non-negative matrix factorization for second-order moment estimation and grouped update normalization. This helps in stabilizing the convergence of adaptive normalization methods, which is crucial for maintaining stability in autoregressive models[Analysis Note, AdaLomo].\n\n## Tiling Strategies for Efficient Computation\n- The \"FlashAttention\" paper emphasizes the use of tiling strategies to reduce memory reads/writes, which is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. This approach can be adapted to improve the computational efficiency of autoregressive models by minimizing memory access costs[Analysis Note, FlashAttention].\n\n## Dimensional Reduction in Neural Networks\n- The \"Loki\" paper shows potential for dimensional reduction in cache management by using low-rank keys for sparse attention. This reduces data movement and compute costs, which can be beneficial for optimizing the computational efficiency of autoregressive models[Analysis Note, Loki].\n\n## Structured Memory Access Patterns\n- The discussion on \"FlashAttention\" and \"Loki\" papers highlights the importance of structured access patterns in reducing memory access costs and improving cache efficiency. These strategies can be integrated into autoregressive models to optimize memory access[Analysis Note, FlashAttention and Loki].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Neural Network Design\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" and the concept of \"Flash-Sigmoid\" attention from Apple's paper demonstrate hardware-aware designs that optimize neural network operations. These designs leverage specific hardware capabilities to improve performance and efficiency, which can be applied to autoregressive language models.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Hierarchical Architectures\n- The \"AdaLomo\" paper provides insights into stability proofs for adaptive methods using grouped normalization and matrix factorization. This helps in ensuring the stability of hierarchical architectures, which is crucial for maintaining performance in autoregressive models[Analysis Note, AdaLomo].\n\nIn summary, the key insights from these sources suggest that:\n\n- **Hardware-efficient normalization** can be achieved through memristor-based in-memory computing and hardware-aware designs like Flash-Sigmoid attention.\n- **Hierarchical feature aggregation** can be optimized using hierarchical structures and cache-aware algorithms.\n- **Cache management** and **memory access optimization** can be improved through tiling strategies and structured access patterns as seen in FlashAttention and Loki[Analysis Note, FlashAttention and Loki].\n- **Convergence analysis** of adaptive normalization can be stabilized using techniques like non-negative matrix factorization and grouped update normalization[Analysis Note, AdaLomo].\n- **Dimensional reduction** and **tiling strategies** can reduce computational costs and improve efficiency[Analysis Note, Loki and FlashAttention].\n- **Hardware-aware design** and **stability analysis** are crucial for optimizing and stabilizing autoregressive language models[Analysis Note, AdaLomo].\n",
