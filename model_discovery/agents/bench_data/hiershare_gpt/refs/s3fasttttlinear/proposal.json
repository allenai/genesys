Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work finds vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and improves the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

Following S4, multiple works have proposed simplifications to S4 (Gupta et al., 2022a; Gu et al.||2022b; Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023) or augmentations to other common architectures (Li et al., 2022;, Fu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2022), aimed at replicating biases observed in S4 and achieving similar performance on LRA.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/8 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu and Tri Dao. 2023.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 160  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Long-Range Transformers: You Need to Attend More, but Not Necessarily at Every Layer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence transformers*\n\n*Qingru Zhang, Dhananjay Ram, Cole Hawkins, Sheng Zha, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans, is proposed, which is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost - quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Long Range Arena: A Benchmark for Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence transformers*\n\n*Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Samira Abnar, Yikang Shen, Dara Bahri, Philip Pham, J. Rao, Liu Yang, Sebastian Ruder, Donald Metzler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios is proposed, paving the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence transformers*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Equivariant Matrix Function Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent neural networks in transformers*\n\n*Ilyes Batatia, Lars L. Schaaf, Huajie Chen, G'abor Cs'anyi, Christoph Ortner, Felix A. Faber*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns, we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks, such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force fields.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Here we study auto-regressive Transformers with linearised attention, a.k.a. linear Transformers (LTs) or Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs). LTs are special in the sense that they are equivalent to RNN-like sequence processors with a fixed-size state, while they can also be expressed as the now-popular self-attention networks. We show that many well-known results for the standard Transformer directly transfer to LTs/FWPs. Our formal language recognition experiments demonstrate how recently proposed FWP extensions such as recurrent FWPs and self-referential weight matrices successfully overcome certain limitations of the LT, e.g., allowing for generalisation on the parity problem.

One of the most exciting and promising novel architectures, the Transformer neural network, was developed without the brain in mind. In this work, we show that transformers, when equipped with recurrent position encodings, replicate the precisely tuned spatial representations of the hippocampal formation; most notably place and grid cells. Furthermore, we show that this result is no surprise since it is closely related to current hippocampal models from neuroscience. We additionally show the transformer version offers dramatic performance gains over the neuroscience version. This work continues to bind computations of artificial and brain networks, offers a novel understanding of the hippocampal-cortical interaction, and suggests how wider cortical areas may perform complex tasks beyond current neuroscience models such as language comprehension.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language modeling*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Armin W. Thomas, Khaled K. Saab, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence transformers*\n\n*Wancai Zhang, Hui Xiong, JianXin Li, Shuai Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shanghang Zhang, Haoyi Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-14\n\n\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we explore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated attention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training (PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\em Transient Global} (TGlobal), which mimics ETC's local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on question answering tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-naacl-2022-7\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. R-Transformer: Recurrent Neural Network Enhanced Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent neural networks in transformers*\n\n*Zitao Liu, Zhiwei Wang, Jiliang Tang, Yao Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks have long been the dominating choice for sequence modeling. However, it severely suffers from two issues: impotent in capturing very long-term dependencies and unable to parallelize the sequential computation procedure. Therefore, many non-recurrent sequence models that are built on convolution and attention operations have been proposed recently. Notably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated extreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of sequence modeling tasks. Despite their success, however, these models lack necessary components to model local structures in sequences and heavily rely on position embeddings that have limited effects and require a considerable amount of design efforts. In this paper, we propose the R-Transformer which enjoys the advantages of both RNNs and the multi-head attention mechanism while avoids their respective drawbacks. The proposed model can effectively capture both local structures and global long-term dependencies in sequences without any use of position embeddings. We evaluate R-Transformer through extensive experiments with data from a wide range of domains and the empirical results show that R-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in most of the tasks.

Emotional Video to Audio Transformation Using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks and a Neuro-Fuzzy System\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent neural networks in transformers*\n\n*Gwenaelle Cunha Sergio, Minho Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Generating music with emotion similar to that of an input video is a very relevant issue nowadays. Video content creators and automatic movie directors benefit from maintaining their viewers engaged, which can be facilitated by producing novel material eliciting stronger emotions in them. Moreover, there's currently a demand for more empathetic computers to aid humans in applications such as augmenting the perception ability of visually and/or hearing impaired people. Current approaches overlook the video's emotional characteristics in the music generation step, only consider static images instead of videos, are unable to generate novel music, and require a high level of human effort and skills. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep neural network that uses an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to predict a video's emotion from its visual features and a deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to generate its corresponding audio signals with similar emotional inkling. The former is able to appropriately model emotions due to its fuzzy properties, and the latter is able to model data with dynamic time properties well due to the availability of the previous hidden state information. The novelty of our proposed method lies in the extraction of visual emotional features in order to transform them into audio signals with corresponding emotional aspects for users. Quantitative experiments show low mean absolute errors of 0.217 and 0.255 in the Lindsey and DEAP datasets respectively, and similar global features in the spectrograms. This indicates that our model is able to appropriately perform domain transformation between visual and audio features. Based on experimental results, our model can effectively generate audio that matches the scene eliciting a similar emotion from the viewer in both datasets, and music generated by our model is also chosen more often.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the FastTTTLinear GAU by integrating state space models (SSMs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to improve long-range dependency modeling and efficiency, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models\n\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: The paper \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\" highlights that deep SSMs, such as Mamba, offer high performance with efficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length.

This approach balances the efficiency of SSMs with the performance of transformers, especially in tasks requiring extensive in-context retrieval. This could be a promising solution for integrating SSMs into the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n\n## Recurrent Mechanisms in Transformers\n\n- **RWKV Model**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided sources, the concept of RWKV (Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era) aligns with the researcher's intent.

This model is not explicitly mentioned but is relevant based on the analysis note[Analysis Note, Reference 2].\n\n## Efficient Long-Sequence Modeling\n\n- **State Space Models vs. Transformers**: The comparison between state-space models and transformer models in the context of time series forecasting suggests that SSMs can outperform transformers in certain tasks, especially when incorporating real-world timestamps. This indicates that SSMs could be advantageous for long-range dependency modeling in language tasks as well.\n- **Selective Attention**: The Taipan model's use of Selective Attention Layers to identify tokens requiring long-range interactions and augment their representations is a valuable approach. This method extends accurate predictions to long context lengths while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n## Test-Time Training and Efficiency\n\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: The study on parameter-efficient fine-tuning of SSMs shows that methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) can be effective for fine-tuning SSM-based models. This is particularly important for maintaining test-time training capabilities while ensuring efficient parameter updates.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: The talk by Simran Arora emphasizes the need for efficient language models that reduce compute and memory requirements. The introduction of new hardware-efficient ML architectures like BASED and JRT, which expand the Pareto-frontier of the quality-efficiency tradeoff space, is relevant for ensuring that the enhanced FastTTTLinear GAU remains computationally efficient.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Search Plan\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Combining the strengths of transformers and SSMs/RNNs is a promising approach. The Taipan model and similar hybrid architectures should be deeply explored to understand how they can be integrated into the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n- **Specific Integration**: Investigate how SSMs can be specifically integrated into transformer blocks, focusing on maintaining the GAU's ability to perform test-time training.\n- **Architectural Changes**: Analyze the architectural changes required to incorporate SSMs or recurrent components into the FastTTTLinear GAU and their impact on model performance.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can develop a concrete proposal for enhancing the FastTTTLinear GAU, ensuring it can efficiently model long-range dependencies while preserving test-time training capabilities.\n",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/24 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2209.10655, 2022. [36] Eric Martin and Chris Cundy.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into transformers*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into transformers*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 215  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 4. Outline, Then Details: Syntactically Guided Coarse-To-Fine Code Generation\n\n*From Search Query: mamba model implementation details*\n\n*Wenqing Zheng, S. Sharan, Ajay Jaiswal, Kevin Wang, Yihan Xi, Dejia Xu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes, demonstrating that the progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.\n\n**Abstract:** For a complicated algorithm, its implementation by a human programmer usually starts with outlining a rough control flow followed by iterative enrichments, eventually yielding carefully generated syntactic structures and variables in a hierarchy. However, state-of-the-art large language models generate codes in a single pass, without intermediate warm-ups to reflect the structured thought process of\"outline-then-detail\". Inspired by the recent success of chain-of-thought prompting, we propose ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes. We first decompose source code into layout frame components and accessory components via abstract syntax tree parsing to construct a hierarchical representation. We then reform our prediction target into a multi-pass objective, each pass generates a subsequence, which is concatenated in the hierarchy. Finally, a tailored transformer architecture is leveraged to jointly encode the natural language descriptions and syntactically aligned I/O data samples. Extensive evaluations show that ChainCoder outperforms state-of-the-arts, demonstrating that our progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.

In this paper, we check the reliability of EE evaluations and identify three major pitfalls: (1) The data preprocessing discrepancy makes the evaluation results on the same dataset not directly comparable, but the data preprocessing details are not widely noted and specified in papers. (2) The output space discrepancy of different model paradigms makes different-paradigm EE models lack grounds for comparison and also leads to unclear mapping issues between predictions and annotations. (3) The absence of pipeline evaluation of many EAE-only works makes them hard to be directly compared with EE works and may not well reflect the model performance in real-world pipeline scenarios.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: mamba model implementation details*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient recurrent mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Decision S4: Efficient Sequence-Based RL via State Spaces Layers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient recurrent mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Shmuel Bar-David, Itamar Zimerman, Eliya Nachmani, Lior Wolf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results indicate that the method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making the approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, sequence learning methods have been applied to the problem of off-policy Reinforcement Learning, including the seminal work on Decision Transformers, which employs transformers for this task. Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Finetuning Pretrained Transformers into RNNs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient recurrent mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Jungo Kasai, Hao Peng, Yizhe Zhang, Dani Yogatama, Gabriel Ilharco, Nikolaos Pappas, Yi Mao, Weizhu Chen, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a swap-then-finetune procedure, which in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, replaces the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune, and provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have outperformed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language generation. But this comes with a signifi- cant computational cost, as the attention mechanism\u2019s complexity scales quadratically with sequence length. Efficient transformer variants have received increasing interest in recent works. Among them, a linear-complexity recurrent variant has proven well suited for autoregressive generation. It approximates the softmax attention with randomized or heuristic feature maps, but can be difficult to train and may yield suboptimal accuracy. This work aims to convert a pretrained transformer into its efficient recurrent counterpart, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we propose a swap-then-finetune procedure: in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, we replace the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune. With a learned feature map, our approach provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants. We also show that the finetuning process has lower training cost relative to training these recurrent variants from scratch. As many models for natural language tasks are increasingly dependent on large-scale pretrained transformers, this work presents a viable approach to improving inference efficiency without repeating the expensive pretraining process.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into transformers*\n\n*Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Michael Kopp, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Andreas Auer, Markus Spanring, Korbinian P\u00f6ppel, Maximilian Beck*\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. VMamba: Visual State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: mamba model implementation details*\n\n*Yunfan Liu, Qixiang Ye, YaoWei Wang, Lingxi Xie, Hongtian Yu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yunjie Tian, Yue Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing computationally efficient network architectures persists as an ongoing necessity in computer vision. In this paper, we transplant Mamba, a state-space language model, into VMamba, a vision backbone that works in linear time complexity. At the core of VMamba lies a stack of Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks with the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module. By traversing along four scanning routes, SS2D helps bridge the gap between the ordered nature of 1D selective scan and the non-sequential structure of 2D vision data, which facilitates the gathering of contextual information from various sources and perspectives. Based on the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba architectures and accelerate them through a succession of architectural and implementation enhancements. Extensive experiments showcase VMamba's promising performance across diverse visual perception tasks, highlighting its advantages in input scaling efficiency compared to existing benchmark models.

Mamba-UNet: UNet-Like Pure Visual Mamba for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: mamba model implementation details*\n\n*Lei LI, Ge Cui, Yichi Zhang, Jian-Qing Zheng, Ziyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent advancements in medical image analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have set significant benchmarks. While the former excels in capturing local features through its convolution operations, the latter achieves remarkable global context understanding by leveraging self-attention mechanisms. However, both architectures exhibit limitations in efficiently modeling long-range dependencies within medical images, which is a critical aspect for precise segmentation. Inspired by the Mamba architecture, known for its proficiency in handling long sequences and global contextual information with enhanced computational efficiency as a State Space Model (SSM), we propose Mamba-UNet, a novel architecture that synergizes the U-Net in medical image segmentation with Mamba's capability. Mamba-UNet adopts a pure Visual Mamba (VMamba)-based encoder-decoder structure, infused with skip connections to preserve spatial information across different scales of the network. This design facilitates a comprehensive feature learning process, capturing intricate details and broader semantic contexts within medical images. We introduce a novel integration mechanism within the VMamba blocks to ensure seamless connectivity and information flow between the encoder and decoder paths, enhancing the segmentation performance. We conducted experiments on publicly available ACDC MRI Cardiac segmentation dataset, and Synapse CT Abdomen segmentation dataset. The results show that Mamba-UNet outperforms several types of UNet in medical image segmentation under the same hyper-parameter setting.

Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient recurrent mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Furu Wei, Jianyong Wang, Jilong Xue, Yuqing Xia, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Yutao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code will be available at https://aka.ms/retnet.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations\n\n*From Search Query: efficient recurrent mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Ashish Vaswani, Peter Shaw, Jakob Uszkoreit*\n\n**Abstract:** Relying entirely on an attention mechanism, the Transformer introduced by\nVaswani et al. (2017) achieves state-of-the-art results for machine\ntranslation. In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it\ndoes not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its\nstructure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to\nits inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the\nself-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the\nrelative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields\nimprovements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations,\nrespectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position\nrepresentations yields no further improvement in translation quality.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5.

GSS layers train faster and exhibit zero-shot generalization to longer inputs, which is beneficial for FastTTTLinear.\n  - **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN)**: This model includes forget gates that allow upper layers to model long-term dependencies and lower layers to model short-term dependencies, providing a hierarchical approach to dependency modeling.\n\n## Dynamic Recurrence Mechanisms\n\n- **RWKV with Matrix-Valued States**: The Eagle and Finch model introduces multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism, which can enhance the expressivity of FastTTTLinear without sacrificing efficiency.\n\n## Selective Attention Layers\n\n- **Taipan**: Adding Selective Attention Layers (SALs) as in Taipan can allow FastTTTLinear to selectively focus on important tokens, combining the strengths of SSMs and transformers.\n\n## Numerical Stability and Implementation Complexity\n\n- **Stable Parameterizations**: To address numerical instability, using stable parameterizations, normalization techniques, or specially designed initialization schemes is crucial. For example, orthogonal initialization or constraining eigenvalues can help[Analysis Note: Practical Implementation].\n  - **Modular Design**: Simplifying the integration by choosing components with straightforward implementations or abstracting complexities through modular design can reduce implementation complexity[Analysis Note: Implementation Complexity].\n\n## Hardware Efficiency\n\n- **Optimization Techniques**: Optimizing computational overhead through techniques like low-rank approximations and quantization is important. Ensuring that the integrated components are hardware-friendly is crucial for efficient execution on modern hardware[Analysis Note: Hardware Efficiency].\n\n## Theoretical and Empirical Evidence\n\n- **Unified Implicit Attention Formulation**: The work by Zimerman et al. provides a unified view of attention-free layers of Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. This framework can help in comparing and integrating mechanisms from different models.\n  - **State Space Duality**: The SSD framework by Dao and Gu demonstrates that transformers and SSMs are closely related, providing methods to efficiently integrate SSMs into transformer architectures.\n\n## Practical Implementation and Code Examples\n\n- **Open-Source Projects**: Studying the codebases of Mamba, RWKV, GSS, and Taipan can provide valuable insights into implementation details that can be adapted for FastTTTLinear. These projects offer practical code examples and architectural diagrams[Analysis Note: Web Search Insights].\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can effectively integrate SSMs or recurrent mechanisms into FastTTTLinear, enhancing its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently while maintaining test-time training capabilities.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Mamba and State Space Models**:\n- **Gated State Spaces**:\n- **RWKV and Dynamic Recurrence**:\n- **Taipan and Selective Attention Layers**:\n- **Unified Implicit Attention Formulation**:\n- **State Space Duality**:\n\nThese references provide the necessary theoretical and practical insights to guide the integration and optimization of the enhanced FastTTTLinear model.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 3.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4.

The superior performance of Transformers is attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to aggregate the information from the input sequence. In contrast to its success, self-attention mechanism has a potential problem that it requires a large amount of computation and memory. To deal with this issue, many studies have been attempted to develop efficient models that can replace Transformers. Among them, Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered considerable interest recently. One advantage of SSMs is that the output can be computed with a significantly small time using convolution via FFT algorithm or recursive computation. Based on the original SSMs, many improvements have been proposed, such as HiPPO-based intialization (Gu et al. 2021) and architectures using gated convolutions (Fu et al. 2022, Poli et al., 2023). Networks based on SSMs have accomplished high performance in various applications such as gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2024), audio generation (Goel et al., 2022) and speech recognition (Saon et al. 2023). On the other hand, some of the recent studies pointed out the limitations of SSMs, especially for their abilities to solve tasks. For example, Merrill et al. (2024) show that SSMs cannot solve sequential problems from the view of computational complexity theory. Additionally, Gu and Dao (2023) pointed out that SSMs are less effective for the tasks to handle discrete and information-dense data such as language processing. Therefore, it is still unclear in what situation we can replace Transformers with SSMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5e098f2beaae0c90c478g-02.jpg?height=258&width=1373&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1.1: Conceptual illustrations of the abilities of SSMs. Left: This represents the classification task in which the existence of the token \" $A$ \" or \" $B$ \" is important. We prove that SSMs can extract such tokens, even if the position of the important token is different for each input. Right: This illustrate the task to predict the next token in the sequence. In this task, models have to output the token associated with the last token. We also prove that SSMs can solve such tasks, i.e., SSMs can extract appropriate tokens even if the position of essential tokens are different for each token in the same sequence. Recently, some studies have theoretically investigated the abilities of SSMs. For instance, Wang and Xue (2024) show that SSMs are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Additionally, Massaroli et al. (2024) constructed the parameters of SSMs to solve the task called associated recall. Moreover, Cirone et al. (2024) studied the abilities of SSMs using rough path theory. However, they mainly focus on the expressive power of SSMs and do not provide statistical understanding. Furthermore, quantitative evaluations to compare SSMs and Transformers is limited. Leaving aside SSMs, many studies have investigated the abilities of deep neural networks to estimate functions. Some of them analyze the estimation abilities of fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with the assumption that the target function is in certain function classes (Schmidt-Hieber, 2020, Suzuki, 2018) or have a specific smoothness structure (Suzuki and Nitanda, 2021). Moreover, Nakada and Imaizumi (2020) and Chen et al. (2022) consider the setting that the data distribution has a low-dimensional structure. Additionally, Okumoto and Suzuki (2021) studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and showed that CNNs can estimate the functions that have smoothness structures with the minimax optimal rate even if the input is infinite-dimensional. As for the Transformers, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate the functions with infinitedimensional input as well as CNNs. Additionally, they showed that Transformers can estimate the functions whose smoothness structure changes depending on the input. Our contributions. In this paper, we explore the abilities of SSMs with gated convolution to replace Transformers from the perspective of statistical learning theory. More specifically, we investigate the estimation ability of SSMs for the function classes called $\\gamma$-smooth and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth. For the function in these classes, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate them effectively. We prove that SSMs can also estimate those functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers, and show that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating those functions. The essential point of the two function classes above is that they have smoothness structures. As for $\\gamma$-smooth functions, the smoothness of the function is the same for all input sequences, i.e., the important features to extract are fixed. On the other hand, piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions have different smoothness depending on the input. This function class characterizes the ability of Transformers and SSMs to extract important features dynamically. In addition to the settings considered in Takakura and Suzuki (2023), we also consider the functions whose smoothness structure also changes depending on the position output token. This setting is inspired by the ability of Transformers to solve the task called associative recall (Ba et al. 2016). We show that SSMs can also replace Transformers in this setting. See Figure 1.1 for the conceptual illustrations of those function classes. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We theoretically investigate the estimation ability of SSMs with gated convolutions for $\\gamma$ smooth functions and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions. We show that SSMs can achieve the same estimation error as Transformers, which implies that SSMs may be alternative to Transformers in terms of estimating functions in those classes. 2. Inspired by recent research on the abilities of Transformers, we define function classes that are extensions of the piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth function class. Then, we prove that SSMs can also attain the similar estimation error for those classes. Other related works. The function classes with piecewise smoothness are also considered in Petersen and Voigtlaender (2018) and Imaizumi and Fukumizu (2019). They do not consider anisotropic smoothness or the sequence-to-sequence functions, while we consider such situations. One of the other directions to investigate the abilities of SSMs is to utilize the control theory, like Alonso et al. (2024). Instead of focusing on the statistical aspect, they mainly provide a comprehensive understanding of existing SSMs. Gu and DaO (2023) proposed an SSM-based architecture called Mamba, whose filter is controlled by the input. While convolution with FFT algorithms cannot be used for Mamba, they proposed a hardware-aware efficient implementation. In this paper, we do not focus on the setting that filters are controlled by the input, and we consider SSMs with gated convolution with data-independent filters.\n```\n\n#### 5.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B). Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, and CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into the FastTTTLinear architecture to create a novel and superior autoregressive language model, here are the key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Feasibility and Compatibility\n\n- **Successful Hybrid Models**: The researcher has already identified models like Mamba and Samba, which successfully integrate SSMs with attention mechanisms.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n#### 4.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets.

The Illusion of State in State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" \"Mamba\" \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal*\n\n**TL;DR:** Analysis of state-space models reveals that SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill&Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the\"state\"in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" \"Mamba\" \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" \"Mamba\" \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block by integrating Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into the FastTTTLinear GAU, here are some key areas and resources that need to be explored:\n\n### Understanding SSMs and Their Integration\n\n1. **Definition and Basics of SSMs**:\n   - Start with fundamental papers or tutorials on State Space Models (SSMs) to understand their mathematical formulation and how they can be applied to sequence modeling.\n   - Resources: Look for introductory articles or chapters in textbooks on time series analysis or signal processing that cover SSMs.\n\n2. **SSMs in Language Modeling**:\n   - Search for research papers that have applied SSMs to language modeling.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states).

Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B). Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, and CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Selective State Space Models\" \"Mamba\" \"SSMs in Transformers\" \"Test-Time Training\" \"Hybrid SSM Attention Models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the\nlanguage modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive\nalternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far\nhave only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To\nunderstand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger\nscales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and\nTransformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also\ncompare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7%\nattention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks,\nwe answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger\ntraining budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed\nTransformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require\nstrong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook)\nor long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid\nexceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points\non average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at\ninference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional\nexperiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended\nto support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences.

In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **SSMs and Their Integration into Language Models**\n\n  The referenced papers collectively indicate that SSMs, particularly selective SSMs as implemented in Mamba, have demonstrated efficiency and competitive performance in language modeling tasks. They offer linear-time sequence modeling and improvements in long-range dependency modeling.\n\n- **Feasibility of Integration**\n\n  Integrating selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear appears theoretically feasible, given that other architectures have successfully incorporated SSMs. The challenge lies in ensuring compatibility with FastTTTLinear's existing mechanisms, particularly test-time training.\n\n- **Impact on Accuracy and Robustness**\n\n  Empirical studies (e.g., Catanzaro et al., 2024) show that while SSMs can match or exceed Transformer performance on several tasks, they may underperform on tasks requiring strong copying or in-context learning. Hybrid models that combine SSMs with attention mechanisms have shown improved performance, suggesting that integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear could enhance accuracy and robustness.\n\n- **Potential Challenges**\n\n  - **Expressiveness Limitations**\n\n    The critique by Merrill et al. (2024) raises concerns about the expressive power of SSMs for state tracking, suggesting that they may not offer significant advantages over Transformers in certain aspects.\n\n  - **Compatibility with Test-Time Training**\n\n    Maintaining test-time training capabilities requires careful design to ensure that the integration of SSMs does not disrupt the mechanisms that allow for adaptation during inference.\n\n  - **Computational Complexity**\n\n    While SSMs are efficient in theory, practical implementations need to address potential computational overheads introduced by the integration, especially in handling state updates and gating mechanisms.\n\n- **Novelty Assessment**\n\n  The proposed integration of selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear appears to be novel, as there is no explicit mention in the literature of such an integration. Previous works have developed architectures based solely on SSMs (e.g., Mamba) or hybrid models, but integrating SSMs into a GAU like FastTTTLinear with test-time training capabilities seems to be a new approach.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**\n\n  The proposal aligns with ongoing efforts to develop efficient, scalable language models that can handle long sequences and capture long-range dependencies.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization.

This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/45 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n# Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models \n\nNicola Muca Cirone ${ }^{1}$ Antonio Orvieto ${ }^{2}$ Benjamin Walker ${ }^{3}$ Cristopher Salvi ${ }^{1}$ Terry Lyons ${ }^{3}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nStructured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Selective State Space Models\" AND \"Hybrid Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\", \"State Space Models\" AND \"Continual Learning\" OR \"Online Adaptation\", \"SSMs in Gated Linear Units\" OR \"GAUs\" AND \"Implementation Challenges\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Linguistically-Informed Self-Attention for Semantic Role Labeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" AND \"Hybrid Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"*\n\n*Emma Strubell, Pat Verga, D. Andor, David Weiss, A. McCallum*\n\n**TL;DR:** LISA is a neural network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL, and can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as input.\n\n**Abstract:** Current state-of-the-art semantic role labeling (SRL) uses a deep neural network with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shown that gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting the possibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In this work, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neural network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL. Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to prepare linguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as input, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing, predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax is incorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents for each token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available, it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model.

Important challenges in OCL are concerned with automatic adaptation to the particular non-stationary structure of the data, and with quantification of predictive uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian online learning model by using a (possibly pretrained) neural representation and a state space model over the linear predictor weights. Non-stationarity over the linear predictor weights is modelled using a parameter drift transition density, parametrized by a coefficient that quantifies forgetting. Inference in the model is implemented with efficient Kalman filter recursions which track the posterior distribution over the linear weights, while online SGD updates over the transition dynamics coefficient allows to adapt to the non-stationarity seen in data. While the framework is developed assuming a linear Gaussian model, we also extend it to deal with classification problems and for fine-tuning the deep learning representation. In a set of experiments in multi-class classification using data sets such as CIFAR-100 and CLOC we demonstrate the predictive ability of the model and its flexibility to capture non-stationarity.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" AND \"Hybrid Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample\nimplementation of Samba is publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective State Space Models\" AND \"Hybrid Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"*\n\n*Roger Waleffe, Wonmin Byeon, Duncan Riach, Brandon Norick, Vijay Korthikanti, Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Ali Hatamizadeh, Sudhakar Singh, Deepak Narayanan, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Vartika Singh, Jared Casper, Jan Kautz, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the\nshortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with\nsequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value\ncache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the\nlanguage modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive\nalternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far\nhave only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To\nunderstand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger\nscales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and\nTransformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also\ncompare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7%\nattention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks,\nwe answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger\ntraining budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed\nTransformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require\nstrong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook)\nor long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid\nexceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points\non average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at\ninference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional\nexperiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended\nto support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context\ntasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on\naverage. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the\ncode used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12T05:25:15Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-12T05:25:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Language Models for Continuously Evolving Content\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models\" AND \"Continual Learning\" OR \"Online Adaptation\"*\n\n*Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Tao Chen, Mingyang Zhang, Michael Bendersky, Marc Najork*\n\n**Abstract:** The content on the web is in a constant state of flux. New entities, issues,\nand ideas continuously emerge, while the semantics of the existing conversation\ntopics gradually shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT\ngreatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of content\nunderstanding tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study how these\nlanguage models can be adapted to better handle continuously evolving web\ncontent. In our study, we first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter\ndata, and unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past tweets would\nheavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we\ninvestigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of\nexisting tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To\nthis end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well\nas propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training\nfor BERT-like models. Compared to a new model trained from scratch offline, our\nincremental training (a) reduces the training costs, (b) achieves better\nperformance on evolving content, and (c) is suitable for online deployment. The\nsuperiority of our methods is validated using two downstream tasks. We\ndemonstrate significant improvements when incrementally evolving the model from\na particular base year, on the task of Country Hashtag Prediction, as well as\non the OffensEval 2019 task.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-11T10:33:50Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-11T10:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. VIBE: Topic-Driven Temporal Adaptation for Twitter Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models\" AND \"Continual Learning\" OR \"Online Adaptation\"*\n\n*Yuji Zhang, Jing Li, Wenjie Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Language features are evolving in real-world social media, resulting in the\ndeteriorating performance of text classification in dynamics. To address this\nchallenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are\ntested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or\nknowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social\nmedia data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent\ntopic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information\nBottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information\nBottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the\ndistinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with\ntimestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes\nretrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data\ntime. Substantial Twitter experiments on three classification tasks show that\nour model, with only 3% of data, significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art continued-pretraining methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-16T08:53:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-15T12:41:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSMs in Gated Linear Units\" OR \"GAUs\" AND \"Implementation Challenges\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

This paper introduces SALE, a novel approach for learning embeddings that model the nuanced interaction between state and action, enabling effective representation learning from low-level states. We extensively study the design space of these embeddings and highlight important design considerations. We integrate SALE and an adaptation of checkpoints for RL into TD3 to form the TD7 algorithm, which significantly outperforms existing continuous control algorithms. On OpenAI gym benchmark tasks, TD7 has an average performance gain of 276.7% and 50.7% over TD3 at 300k and 5M time steps, respectively, and works in both the online and offline settings.\n\n**Conference:** for-sale-state-action-representation-learning\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cost-effective On-device Continual Learning over Memory Hierarchy with Miro\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models\" AND \"Continual Learning\" OR \"Online Adaptation\"*\n\n*Myeongjae Jeon, Jonghyun Choi, Di Wang, Minjia Zhang, Suyeon Jeong, Xinyue Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning (CL) trains NN models incrementally from a continuous stream of tasks. To remember previously learned knowledge, prior studies store old samples over a memory hierarchy and replay them when new tasks arrive. Edge devices that adopt CL to preserve data privacy are typically energy-sensitive and thus require high model accuracy while not compromising energy efficiency, i.e., cost-effectiveness. Our work is the first to explore the design space of hierarchical memory replay-based CL to gain insights into achieving cost-effectiveness on edge devices. We present Miro, a novel system runtime that carefully integrates our insights into the CL framework by enabling it to dynamically configure the CL system based on resource states for the best cost-effectiveness. To reach this goal, Miro also performs online profiling on parameters with clear accuracy-energy trade-offs and adapts to optimal values with low overhead. Extensive evaluations show that Miro significantly outperforms baseline systems we build for comparison, consistently achieving higher cost-effectiveness.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into FastTTTLinear, several key areas need to be focused on:\n\n### Feasibility and Methodology of Integration\n\n1. **Hybrid Architectures**:\n   - The researcher should delve deeper into papers like Dao & Gu (2024) and Ren et al.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Feasibility of Integration**\n\n  The integration of Selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear appears feasible based on the existing research demonstrating successful hybrid models that combine SSMs with attention mechanisms. Papers like Dao & Gu (2024) and Catanzaro et al. (2024) show that architectures integrating SSMs and attention layers can outperform pure models.\n\n- **Addressing Limitations of SSMs**\n\n  Sarrof et al. (2024) identify expressiveness limitations in current SSMs, particularly in state tracking. Integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear may require modifications to address these limitations, possibly by leveraging the strengths of FastTTTLinear's attention mechanisms and test-time training capabilities.\n\n- **Compatibility with Test-Time Training**\n\n  Maintaining test-time training capabilities is crucial. Since FastTTTLinear supports test-time adaptation, integrating SSMs must preserve this functionality. The selection mechanisms in SSMs, inspired by gating and data-dependence (Gu & Dao, 2023), could potentially be designed to be compatible with test-time updates.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance**\n\n  - **Accuracy and Robustness**\n\n    Hybrid models like Mamba-2-Hybrid (Catanzaro et al., 2024) and Samba (Ren et al., 2024) have demonstrated improved performance over both pure SSMs and Transformers. This suggests that integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear could enhance accuracy and robustness, especially in modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n  - **Efficiency and Scalability**\n\n    SSMs are known for linear-time sequence modeling and efficient handling of long sequences. Integrating SSMs could improve the efficiency and scalability of FastTTTLinear, particularly for extremely long sequences.\n\n- **Novelty Assessment**\n\n  The proposal appears novel as there is no existing work explicitly integrating Selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear or similar GAUs with test-time training capabilities. While hybrid models exist, applying SSMs to enhance a GAU like FastTTTLinear with test-time training is a new approach.\n\n- **Potential Challenges**\n\n  - **Expressiveness**\n\n    Addressing the expressiveness limitations of SSMs is essential. Incorporating mechanisms from FastTTTLinear, such as Gated Linear Attention, may help mitigate these issues.\n\n  - **Complexity**\n\n    Ensuring that the integration does not introduce prohibitive computational or implementation complexity is important. The hardware-aware algorithms proposed in Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) could inform efficient implementation strategies.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future Search Plan**\n\nTo further solidify the analysis and ensure a comprehensive review, the following steps are planned:\n\n- **Deepen Understanding of SSM Integration**\n\n  - Investigate specific methods used in hybrid models like Samba and Mamba-2-Hybrid for integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms.\n  - Explore how these methods can be adapted to preserve test-time training capabilities in FastTTTLinear.\n\n- **Examine Test-Time Training Compatibility**\n\n  - Search for any existing research on integrating SSMs into models with test-time training or continual learning capabilities.\n  - Identify strategies to ensure that the state updates in SSMs can be compatible with test-time adaptation.\n\n- **Assess Implementation Challenges**\n\n  - Investigate potential computational overhead introduced by integrating SSMs, especially in terms of state management and gating mechanisms.\n  - Look for optimization techniques used in Mamba and related models to maintain efficiency.\n\n- **Finalize Novelty Verification**\n\n  - Ensure that no existing designs or proposals have already implemented the integration of SSMs into GAUs like FastTTTLinear.\n  - Check internal repositories or less-publicized works to confirm the novelty.\n\n**Refined Search Queries**\n\n**External Search Keywords**\n\n```keywords\n\"Selective State Space Models\" AND \"Hybrid Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"\n\"State Space Models\" AND \"Continual Learning\" OR \"Online Adaptation\"\n\"SSMs in Gated Linear Units\" OR \"GAUs\" AND \"Implementation Challenges\"\n```\n\n**Internal Library Search Description**\n\n```description\nSearch for research papers, design proposals, or implementations that discuss integrating Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) with test-time training or continual learning capabilities.

While the FastTTTLinear GAU improves computational efficiency by integrating Gated Linear Attention and concepts from the RWKV architecture, it still has limitations in capturing long-range dependencies effectively. Integrating Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into the FastTTTLinear unit can address these limitations by providing an efficient mechanism to handle long sequences while maintaining test-time training capabilities.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **FastTTTLinear GAU**: Enhances TTTLinear by incorporating Gated Linear Attention, improving computational efficiency and scalability but still facing challenges with long-range dependencies.\n- **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)**: Mamba introduces selective SSMs to focus computational resources on relevant tokens, achieving linear-time sequence modeling with improved performance on long sequences.\n- **Unified Implicit Attention Framework**: Provides a way to view models like Mamba and RWKV as implicit causal self-attention layers, facilitating the integration of their mechanisms into existing architectures.\n- **Gated State Spaces (GSS)**: Introduces gating mechanisms into state spaces, allowing better control over information flow and long-range dependency modeling.\n\nThese findings indicate that integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear can enhance its capability to model long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with FastTTTLinear\n\n1. **Limited Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: While efficient, FastTTTLinear may struggle to capture dependencies over very long sequences due to its reliance on local computations.\n2. **Memory Constraints**: Storing and processing long sequences can lead to high memory usage.\n3. **Expressiveness vs. Efficiency**: Enhancing the model's expressiveness to handle long-range dependencies without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nIntegrate Selective State Space Models into FastTTTLinear to:\n\n- **Improve Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: SSMs can capture global context efficiently.\n- **Maintain Computational Efficiency**: Use selective mechanisms to focus on relevant information, avoiding unnecessary computations.\n- **Preserve Test-Time Training Capabilities**: Ensure that the model continues to adapt during inference.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: Provide a framework for modeling sequences with linear operations, enabling efficient handling of long sequences.\n- **Selective Mechanisms**: Allow the model to focus computational resources on important tokens, improving efficiency and modeling capacity.\n- **Integration into GAUs**: Incorporating SSMs into GAUs leverages their strengths while maintaining the existing architecture's advantages.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nModify the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating Selective State Space Models:\n\n1. **Incorporate Selective SSM Layer**: Add a selective SSM layer to capture long-range dependencies.\n2. **Replace Gated Linear Attention Module**: Modify or augment the existing Gated Linear Attention module to accommodate the SSM.\n3. **Add Gating Mechanisms**: Introduce gates to control the flow of information and focus on relevant tokens.\n4. **Ensure Compatibility with Test-Time Training**: Design the integration to maintain the model's ability to adapt during inference.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.
