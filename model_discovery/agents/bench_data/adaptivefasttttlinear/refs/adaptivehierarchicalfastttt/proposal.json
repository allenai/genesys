Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Ruslan Khalitov, Tong Yu, Lei Cheng, Zhirong Yang*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths, and substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential data naturally have different lengths in many domains, with some very long sequences. As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), volume 30, 2017.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9566  (*Influential: 1895*)\n\n#### 2. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks and enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

Park, Nako Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations are presented, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions, to support more precise and interpretable memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Remembering important information from the past and continuing to talk about it in the present are crucial in long-term conversations. However, previous literature does not deal with cases where the memorized information is outdated, which may cause confusion in later conversations. To address this issue, we present a novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions. In order to support more precise and interpretable memory, we represent memory as unstructured text descriptions of key information and propose a new mechanism of memory management that selectively eliminates invalidated or redundant information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines that leave the stored memory unchanged in terms of engagingness and humanness, with larger performance gap especially in the later sessions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Prototype memory and attention mechanisms for few shot image generation\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tianqin Li, Zijie Li, Andrew Luo, Harold Rockwell, A. Farimani, T. Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors of macaque monkeys can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent discoveries indicate that the neural codes in the super\ufb01cial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys are complex, diverse and super-sparse. This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*David Donahue, Vladislav Lialin, Anna Rumshisky*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become increasingly popular over the past\ntwo years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the\nlevel of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer\nmodels do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is\nwidely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce\nhierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the\nU-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of\nnatural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the\ndomain of chit-chat dialogue.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-16T15:48:46Z  (*Updated: 2021-04-01T19:41:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

This\narchitecture allows us to update a memory module with an equal ratio across\ngender types addressing biased correlations directly in the latent space.

Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4.

We apply the model on two Electronic Health Records datasets with Discharge Summaries in two languages with fewer resources than English, Spanish and Swedish. Our model leverages the BERT Multilingual model (specifically the Wikipedia, as the model have been trained with 104 languages, including Spanish and Swedish, with the largest Wikipedia dumps) to share the language modelling capabilities across the languages. With the per-label attention, the model can compute the relevance of each word from the EHR towards the prediction of each label. For the experimental framework, we apply 157 labels from Chapter XI \u2013 Diseases of the Digestive System of the ICD, which makes the attention especially important as the model has to discriminate between similar diseases. 1 https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages\n\n**Proceeding:** ranlp-2021-9\n\n**Published:** None\n\n\n\n#### 6. An Empirical Study of Spatial Attention Mechanisms in Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jifeng Dai, Xizhou Zhu, Stephen Lin, Dazhi Cheng, Zheng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become a popular component in deep neural networks,\nyet there has been little examination of how different influencing factors and\nmethods for computing attention from these factors affect performance. Toward a\nbetter general understanding of attention mechanisms, we present an empirical\nstudy that ablates various spatial attention elements within a generalized\nattention formulation, encompassing the dominant Transformer attention as well\nas the prevalent deformable convolution and dynamic convolution modules.\nConducted on a variety of applications, the study yields significant findings\nabout spatial attention in deep networks, some of which run counter to\nconventional understanding. For example, we find that the query and key content\ncomparison in Transformer attention is negligible for self-attention, but vital\nfor encoder-decoder attention. A proper combination of deformable convolution\nwith key content only saliency achieves the best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff\nin self-attention. Our results suggest that there exists much room for\nimprovement in the design of attention mechanisms.\n\n**Conference:** an-empirical-study-of-spatial-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on hierarchical multi-scale processing, efficient attention mechanisms, and effective memory management for long sequences, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-demonstrated in the **Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs** approach, which integrates temporal information into LLMs for tasks like multivariate time series classification. This model uses a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data, ensuring that the model retains essential temporal patterns while being adaptable to specific tasks.\n- This hierarchical feature encoding strategy can be adapted to language models to handle long sequences by breaking down the sequence into multiple scales and processing each scale hierarchically.\n\n## Memory Management\n\n- **State Memory Replay (SMR)** is a strategy that addresses memory issues in state-space models by using a non-recursive sample processing approach. This method can be applied to autoregressive LMs to manage memory efficiently for long sequences[Analysis Note, Reference 5].\n- The integration of **temporal latent bottlenecks and adaptive state compression**, as proposed in the HierarchicalFastTTTLinear design, aligns with strategies like SMR to optimize memory usage. This involves compressing and managing state information adaptively to reduce memory footprint without compromising performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Efficient attention mechanisms** are crucial for handling long sequences. The **LinearAttention module** and **FastTTTLinearRoPE** proposals highlight the importance of efficient attention mechanisms, such as selective linear attention and Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE), which improve positional understanding and stability while maintaining efficiency[Analysis Note, References 2 and 1].\n- The use of **hierarchical attention mechanisms**, as seen in the Hierarchical Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for text classification, can also be explored. This approach uses hierarchical attention to capture context at different levels, which can be beneficial for long sequences in LMs.\n\n## Empirical Validation and Future Steps\n\n- To validate the proposed hierarchical processing and memory management strategies, it is essential to conduct empirical studies. Searching for benchmarks and empirical studies related to these aspects in LMs can provide valuable insights[Analysis Note, Future search plan].\n- Further exploration of **state-space models** with hierarchical processing could inspire new approaches. State-space models with layer-wise nonlinearity are universal approximators and can be integrated with hierarchical processing to enhance sequence modeling capabilities[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT)** models, which use retrieval mechanisms to handle long-range dependencies, can also be considered. These models emphasize the importance of retrieval for long texts, which can be integrated with hierarchical processing and efficient attention mechanisms[Analysis Note, Reference 4].\n- **Optimization techniques** such as those used in the Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs (e.g., LoRA fine-tuning) can help manage the complexity of integrating multiple mechanisms. LoRA reduces the number of parameters to be fine-tuned, improving computational efficiency while maintaining focus on generative tasks.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop an autoregressive LM that leverages hierarchical multi-scale processing, efficient attention mechanisms, and adaptive memory management, ultimately enhancing the model's performance on long sequences.\n",

Score: 0.81)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9566  (*Influential: 1895*)\n\n#### 2. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

Park, Nako Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations are presented, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions, to support more precise and interpretable memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Remembering important information from the past and continuing to talk about it in the present are crucial in long-term conversations. However, previous literature does not deal with cases where the memorized information is outdated, which may cause confusion in later conversations. To address this issue, we present a novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions. In order to support more precise and interpretable memory, we represent memory as unstructured text descriptions of key information and propose a new mechanism of memory management that selectively eliminates invalidated or redundant information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines that leave the stored memory unchanged in terms of engagingness and humanness, with larger performance gap especially in the later sessions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Learning to Ignore: Long Document Coreference with Bounded Memory Neural\n  Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Shubham Toshniwal, Sam Wiseman, Allyson Ettinger, Karen Livescu, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**Abstract:** Long document coreference resolution remains a challenging task due to the\nlarge memory and runtime requirements of current models. Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

For example, gender bias is a significant problem when\ngenerating text, and its unintended memorization could impact the user\nexperience of many applications (e.g., the smart-compose feature in Gmail).\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that decouples the\nrepresentation learning of a neural model from its memory management role. This\narchitecture allows us to update a memory module with an equal ratio across\ngender types addressing biased correlations directly in the latent space. We\nexperimentally show that our approach can mitigate the gender bias\namplification in the automatic generation of articles news while providing\nsimilar perplexity values when extending the Sequence2Sequence architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-01T16:52:02Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Martins, Joseph Morlier, John T. Hwang, Thierry Lefebvre, Jasper Bussemaker, Youssef Diouane, Nathalie Bartoli, Remi Lafage, Paul Saves*\n\n**Abstract:** The Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) is an open-source Python package that offers a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and a set of sample problems. This paper presents SMT 2.0, a major new release of SMT that introduces significant upgrades and new features to the toolbox. This release adds the capability to handle mixed-variable surrogate models and hierarchical variables. These types of variables are becoming increasingly important in several surrogate modeling applications. SMT 2.0 also improves SMT by extending sampling methods, adding new surrogate models, and computing variance and kernel derivatives for Kriging. This release also includes new functions to handle noisy and use multifidelity data. To the best of our knowledge, SMT 2.0 is the first open-source surrogate library to propose surrogate models for hierarchical and mixed inputs.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mesh: Compacting Memory Management for C/C++ Applications\n\n*From Search Query: memory management*\n\n*Andrew Mcgregor, Emery D.

This paper introduces Mesh, a plug-in\nreplacement for malloc that, for the first time, eliminates fragmentation in\nunmodified C/C++ applications. Mesh combines novel randomized algorithms with\nwidely-supported virtual memory operations to provably reduce fragmentation,\nbreaking the classical Robson bounds with high probability. Mesh generally\nmatches the runtime performance of state-of-the-art memory allocators while\nreducing memory consumption; in particular, it reduces the memory of\nconsumption of Firefox by 16% and Redis by 39%.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-13\n\n\n\n#### 5. Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Francisco Massa, Matthijs Douze, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) focusing on hierarchical processing, memory management, and efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and relevant studies:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n\n- The paper on **HiTime** introduces a hierarchical multimodal model that seamlessly incorporates temporal features into LLMs. This model uses a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data through both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. This approach ensures that the model retains essential temporal patterns and is adaptable to specific classification tasks.\n\n- **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN)** is another example that uses hierarchical gating to model long-term and short-term dependencies efficiently. This model demonstrates the potential of hierarchical processing for handling long sequences (Analysis Note).\n\n## Memory Management\n\n- The study on **Efficient Arbitrary Precision Acceleration for Large Language Models** highlights a novel memory management approach oriented by efficient data recovery. This strategy maximizes the use of faster shared memory, reducing memory access latency and enhancing kernel execution speed. The approach involves matrix decomposition and reassembly, and an efficient matrix preprocessing method, which are crucial for managing memory efficiently in large LLMs.\n\n- **Multilevel Paging** in operating systems is a memory management technique that can be analogously applied to manage large memory spaces in LLMs. This technique breaks down the virtual address space into smaller, more manageable pieces, reducing memory overhead and improving system performance. Although it adds complexity, it provides greater flexibility in organizing memory space.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **ChordMixer** proposes a neural network building block for modeling attention in long sequences with variable lengths. It uses a position-wise rotation layer and an element-wise MLP layer, which helps in maintaining computational efficiency while handling long sequences (Analysis Note).\n\n- **Retentive Network (RetNet)** also incorporates efficient attention mechanisms, supporting parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent computation paradigms. This model is designed to handle long sequences efficiently and can be integrated with other models like Transformers and state-space models (Analysis Note).\n\n## Integration of State-Space Models\n\n- Integrating state-space models with hierarchical processing can be beneficial for modeling long sequences. For instance, **HiTime** aligns time series embeddings with textual semantics in a shared latent space, which is a form of state-space alignment. This approach enhances the model\u2019s classification capabilities by leveraging multimodal information and optimizing its understanding of time series data.\n\n## Advanced Optimization Techniques\n\n- The **Efficient Arbitrary Precision Acceleration** study introduces several optimization techniques, including a novel bipolar-INT data format, arbitrary precision matrix multiplication, and efficient matrix preprocessing. These techniques are designed to maximize GPU Tensor Core utilization and reduce memory redundancy, which are essential for handling the complexity of integrating multiple mechanisms in LLMs.\n\n## Empirical Validation and Benchmarks\n\n- To validate these approaches, it is crucial to conduct empirical studies and benchmarks. For example, **HiTime** has been tested on benchmark datasets for multivariate time series classification, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods. Similar empirical validations should be conducted for other models like RetNet, ChordMixer, and HGRN to ensure their efficacy in real-world scenarios.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage hierarchical processing, advanced memory management, and optimized attention mechanisms.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning).

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

A New Benchmark and Reverse Validation Method for Passage-level Hallucination Detection\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Shiping Yang, Renliang Sun, Xiao-Yi Wan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion to detect hallucinations in large Language Models, and considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to collaborate effectively with humans in real-world scenarios. However, LLMs are apt to generate hallucinations, i.e., makeup incorrect text and unverified information, which can cause significant damage when deployed for mission-critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion. To facilitate future studies and assess different methods, we construct a hallucination detection benchmark named PHD, which is generated by ChatGPT and annotated by human annotators. Contrasting previous studies of zero-resource hallucination detection, our method and benchmark concentrate on passage-level detection instead of sentence-level. We empirically evaluate our method and existing zero-resource detection methods on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time. Furthermore, we manually analyze some hallucination cases that LLM failed to capture, revealing the shared limitation of zero-resource methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Iterative Approximate Cross-Validation\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Yuetian Luo, Zhimei Ren, R. Barber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most popular tools for assessing and selecting predictive models. However, standard CV suffers from high computational cost when the number of folds is large. Recently, under the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, a line of works proposed efficient methods to approximate CV based on the solution of the ERM problem trained on the full dataset. However, in large-scale problems, it can be hard to obtain the exact solution of the ERM problem, either due to limited computational resources or due to early stopping as a way of preventing overfitting. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence. Our new method extends existing guarantees for CV approximation to hold along the whole trajectory of the algorithm, including at convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method through a range of empirical studies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Empirical Analysis of Model Selection for Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Divyat Mahajan, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Brady Neal, Vasilis Syrgkanis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work, and suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE estimators and causal ensembling.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of model selection in causal inference, specifically for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. Unlike machine learning, there is no perfect analogue of cross-validation for model selection as we do not observe the counterfactual potential outcomes. Towards this, a variety of surrogate metrics have been proposed for CATE model selection that use only observed data. However, we do not have a good understanding regarding their effectiveness due to limited comparisons in prior studies. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work. We ensure a fair comparison by tuning the hyperparameters associated with these metrics via AutoML, and provide more detailed trends by incorporating realistic datasets via generative modeling. Our analysis suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE estimators and causal ensembling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Symbolic Discovery of Optimization Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Xiangning Chen, Chen Liang, Da Huang, Esteban Real, Kaiyuan Wang, Yao Liu, Hieu Pham, Xuanyi Dong, Thang Luong, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Yifeng Lu, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 240  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 5. Automatic Prompt Optimization with \"Gradient Descent\" and Beam Search\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Reid Pryzant, Dan Iter, Jerry Li, Y. Lee, Chenguang Zhu, Michael Zeng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Preliminary results suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance as general purpose agents, but their abilities remain highly dependent on prompts which are hand written with onerous trial-and-error effort. We propose a simple and nonparametric solution to this problem, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which is inspired by numerical gradient descent to automatically improve prompts, assuming access to training data and an LLM API. The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language\"gradients\"that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then\"propagated\"into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 203  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n#### 6. Smoothness Matrices Beat Smoothness Constants: Better Communication Compression Techniques for Distributed Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*M. Safaryan, Filip Hanzely, Peter Richt\u00e1rik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses and describes how this sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Large scale distributed optimization has become the default tool for the training of supervised machine learning models with a large number of parameters and training data. Recent advancements in the field provide several mechanisms for speeding up the training, including {\\em compressed communication}, {\\em variance reduction} and {\\em acceleration}. However, none of these methods is capable of exploiting the inherently rich data-dependent smoothness structure of the local losses beyond standard smoothness constants. In this paper, we argue that when training supervised models, {\\em smoothness matrices} -- information-rich generalizations of the ubiquitous smoothness constants -- can and should be exploited for further dramatic gains, both in theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses. To showcase the power of this tool, we describe how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity. The new methods always outperform the baselines, often dramatically so.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9566  (*Influential: 1895*)\n\n#### 8. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks and enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Multi-Turn Beam Search for Neural Dialogue Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Ilia Kulikov, Jason Lee, Kyunghyun Cho*\n\n**Abstract:** In neural dialogue modeling, a neural network is trained to predict the next\nutterance, and at inference time, an approximate decoding algorithm is used to\ngenerate next utterances given previous ones. While this autoregressive\nframework allows us to model the whole conversation during training, inference\nis highly suboptimal, as a wrong utterance can affect future utterances. While\nbeam search yields better results than greedy search does, we argue that it is\nstill greedy in the context of the entire conversation, in that it does not\nconsider future utterances. We propose a novel approach for conversation-level\ninference by explicitly modeling the dialogue partner and running beam search\nacross multiple conversation turns. Given a set of candidates for next\nutterance, we unroll the conversation for a number of turns and identify the\ncandidate utterance in the initial hypothesis set that gives rise to the most\nlikely sequence of future utterances. We empirically validate our approach by\nconducting human evaluation using the Persona-Chat dataset, and find that our\nmulti-turn beam search generates significantly better dialogue responses. We\npropose three approximations to the partner model, and observe that more\ninformed partner models give better performance.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-01T03:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-12T14:16:25Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

The temporal evolution of these relations is\ndescribed by dynamic word embeddings, that are designed to learn semantic\nchanges over time. An empirical analysis of the corresponding character\ntrajectories shows that such approaches are effective in depicting dynamic\nevolution. A supervised learning approach based on the state-of-the-art\ntransformer model BERT is used instead to detect static relations between\ncharacters. The empirical validation shows that such events (e.g., two\ncharacters belonging to the same family) might be spotted with good accuracy,\neven when using automatically annotated data. This provides a deeper\nunderstanding of narrative plots based on the identification of key facts.\nStandard clustering techniques are finally used for character de-aliasing, a\nnecessary pre-processing step for both approaches. Overall, deep learning\nmodels appear to be suitable for narrative text understanding, while also\nproviding a challenging and unexploited benchmark for general natural language\nunderstanding.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-19T14:23:12Z  (*Updated: 2020-03-19T14:23:12Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. PocketLLM: Enabling On-Device Fine-Tuning for Personalized LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Dan Peng, Zhihui Fu, Jun Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have indeed showcased\ntheir impressive capabilities. On mobile devices, the wealth of valuable,\nnon-public data generated daily holds great promise for locally fine-tuning\npersonalized LLMs, while maintaining privacy through on-device processing.\nHowever, the constraints of mobile device resources pose challenges to direct\non-device LLM fine-tuning, mainly due to the memory-intensive nature of\nderivative-based optimization required for saving gradients and optimizer\nstates. To tackle this, we propose employing derivative-free optimization\ntechniques to enable on-device fine-tuning of LLM, even on memory-limited\nmobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate that the RoBERTa-large model and\nOPT-1.3B can be fine-tuned locally on the OPPO Reno 6 smartphone using around\n4GB and 6.5GB of memory respectively, using derivative-free optimization\ntechniques.

Validation of semi-analytical, semi-empirical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for Early DESI data\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an extended validation of semi-analytical, semi-empirical covariance matrices for the two-point correlation function (2PCF) on simulated catalogs representative of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) data collected during the initial two months of operations of the Stage-IV ground-based Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We run the pipeline on multiple effective Zel'dovich (EZ) mock galaxy catalogs with the corresponding cuts applied and compare the results with the mock sample covariance to assess the accuracy and its fluctuations. We propose an extension of the previously developed formalism for catalogs processed with standard reconstruction algorithms. We consider methods for comparing covariance matrices in detail, highlighting their interpretation and statistical properties caused by sample variance, in particular, nontrivial expectation values of certain metrics even when the external covariance estimate is perfect. With improved mocks and validation techniques, we confirm a good agreement between our predictions and sample covariance. This allows one to generate covariance matrices for comparable datasets without the need to create numerous mock galaxy catalogs with matching clustering, only requiring 2PCF measurements from the data itself.

Here we study ridge regression when the analyst can partition the features into $K$ groups based on external side-information. For example, in high-throughput biology, features may represent gene expression, protein abundance or clinical data and so each feature group represents a distinct modality. The analyst's goal is to choose optimal regularization parameters $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dotsc, \\lambda_K)$ -- one for each group. In this work, we study the impact of $\\lambda$ on the predictive risk of group-regularized ridge regression by deriving limiting risk formulae under a high-dimensional random effects model with $p\\asymp n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven method for choosing $\\lambda$ that attains the optimal asymptotic risk: The key idea is to interpret the residual noise variance $\\sigma^2$, as a regularization parameter to be chosen through cross-validation. An empirical Bayes construction maps the one-dimensional parameter $\\sigma$ to the $K$-dimensional vector of regularization parameters, i.e., $\\sigma \\mapsto \\widehat{\\lambda}(\\sigma)$.

It has been shown that using the first and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training performance. Different from these existing methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more efficient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to fine-tune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classification, fine-grained image classification, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning. The code of GC can be found at https://github.com/Yonghongwei/Gradient-Centralization.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. Implicit bulk-surface filtering method for node-based shape optimization and comparison of explicit and implicit filtering techniques\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This work studies shape filtering techniques, namely the convolution-based (explicit) and the PDE-based (implicit), and introduces an implicit bulk-surface filtering method to control the boundary smoothness and preserve the internal mesh quality simultaneously in the course of bulk (solid) shape optimization. To that end, volumetric mesh is filtered by the solution of pseudo-solid governing equations which are stiffened by the mesh-Jacobian and endowed with the Robin boundary condition which involves the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the mesh boundaries. Its superior performance from the non-simultaneous (sequential) treatment of boundary and internal meshes is demonstrated for the shape optimization of a complex solid structure. Well-established explicit filters, namely Gaussian and linear, and the Helmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter are critically examined in terms of consistency (rigid-body-movement production), geometric characteristics and the computational cost. It is shown that the implicit filtering is numerically more efficient and unconditionally consistent, compared to the explicit one. Supported by numerical experiments, a regularized Green's function is introduced as an equivalent explicit form of the Helmholtz/Sobolev filter. Furthermore, we give special attention to derive mesh-independent filtered sensitivities for node-based shape optimization with non-uniform meshes. It is shown that the mesh independent filtering can be achieved by scaling discrete sensitivities with the inverse of the mesh mass matrix.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-01\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Martins, Joseph Morlier, John T. Hwang, Thierry Lefebvre, Jasper Bussemaker, Youssef Diouane, Nathalie Bartoli, Remi Lafage, Paul Saves*\n\n**Abstract:** The Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) is an open-source Python package that offers a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and a set of sample problems. This paper presents SMT 2.0, a major new release of SMT that introduces significant upgrades and new features to the toolbox. This release adds the capability to handle mixed-variable surrogate models and hierarchical variables. These types of variables are becoming increasingly important in several surrogate modeling applications. SMT 2.0 also improves SMT by extending sampling methods, adding new surrogate models, and computing variance and kernel derivatives for Kriging. This release also includes new functions to handle noisy and use multifidelity data. To the best of our knowledge, SMT 2.0 is the first open-source surrogate library to propose surrogate models for hierarchical and mixed inputs.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

However, LLMs are apt to generate hallucinations, i.e., makeup incorrect text and unverified information, which can cause significant damage when deployed for mission-critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion. To facilitate future studies and assess different methods, we construct a hallucination detection benchmark named PHD, which is generated by ChatGPT and annotated by human annotators. Contrasting previous studies of zero-resource hallucination detection, our method and benchmark concentrate on passage-level detection instead of sentence-level. We empirically evaluate our method and existing zero-resource detection methods on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time. Furthermore, we manually analyze some hallucination cases that LLM failed to capture, revealing the shared limitation of zero-resource methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Iterative Approximate Cross-Validation\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Yuetian Luo, Zhimei Ren, R. Barber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most popular tools for assessing and selecting predictive models. However, standard CV suffers from high computational cost when the number of folds is large. Recently, under the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, a line of works proposed efficient methods to approximate CV based on the solution of the ERM problem trained on the full dataset. However, in large-scale problems, it can be hard to obtain the exact solution of the ERM problem, either due to limited computational resources or due to early stopping as a way of preventing overfitting. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence. Our new method extends existing guarantees for CV approximation to hold along the whole trajectory of the algorithm, including at convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method through a range of empirical studies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Empirical Analysis of Model Selection for Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Divyat Mahajan, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Brady Neal, Vasilis Syrgkanis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work, and suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE estimators and causal ensembling.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of model selection in causal inference, specifically for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. Unlike machine learning, there is no perfect analogue of cross-validation for model selection as we do not observe the counterfactual potential outcomes. Towards this, a variety of surrogate metrics have been proposed for CATE model selection that use only observed data. However, we do not have a good understanding regarding their effectiveness due to limited comparisons in prior studies. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work. We ensure a fair comparison by tuning the hyperparameters associated with these metrics via AutoML, and provide more detailed trends by incorporating realistic datasets via generative modeling. Our analysis suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE estimators and causal ensembling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Symbolic Discovery of Optimization Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Xiangning Chen, Chen Liang, Da Huang, Esteban Real, Kaiyuan Wang, Yao Liu, Hieu Pham, Xuanyi Dong, Thang Luong, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Yifeng Lu, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 240  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 5. Automatic Prompt Optimization with \"Gradient Descent\" and Beam Search\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Reid Pryzant, Dan Iter, Jerry Li, Y. Lee, Chenguang Zhu, Michael Zeng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Preliminary results suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance as general purpose agents, but their abilities remain highly dependent on prompts which are hand written with onerous trial-and-error effort. We propose a simple and nonparametric solution to this problem, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which is inspired by numerical gradient descent to automatically improve prompts, assuming access to training data and an LLM API. The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language\"gradients\"that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then\"propagated\"into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 203  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n#### 6. Smoothness Matrices Beat Smoothness Constants: Better Communication Compression Techniques for Distributed Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*M. Safaryan, Filip Hanzely, Peter Richt\u00e1rik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses and describes how this sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Large scale distributed optimization has become the default tool for the training of supervised machine learning models with a large number of parameters and training data. Recent advancements in the field provide several mechanisms for speeding up the training, including {\\em compressed communication}, {\\em variance reduction} and {\\em acceleration}. However, none of these methods is capable of exploiting the inherently rich data-dependent smoothness structure of the local losses beyond standard smoothness constants. In this paper, we argue that when training supervised models, {\\em smoothness matrices} -- information-rich generalizations of the ubiquitous smoothness constants -- can and should be exploited for further dramatic gains, both in theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses. To showcase the power of this tool, we describe how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity. The new methods always outperform the baselines, often dramatically so.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9566  (*Influential: 1895*)\n\n#### 8. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Anurag Ajay, Seung-Jun Han, Yilun Du, Shaung Li, Abhishek Gupta, T. Jaakkola, Josh Tenenbaum, L. Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks and enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Multi-Turn Beam Search for Neural Dialogue Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Ilia Kulikov, Jason Lee, Kyunghyun Cho*\n\n**Abstract:** In neural dialogue modeling, a neural network is trained to predict the next\nutterance, and at inference time, an approximate decoding algorithm is used to\ngenerate next utterances given previous ones. While this autoregressive\nframework allows us to model the whole conversation during training, inference\nis highly suboptimal, as a wrong utterance can affect future utterances. While\nbeam search yields better results than greedy search does, we argue that it is\nstill greedy in the context of the entire conversation, in that it does not\nconsider future utterances. We propose a novel approach for conversation-level\ninference by explicitly modeling the dialogue partner and running beam search\nacross multiple conversation turns. Given a set of candidates for next\nutterance, we unroll the conversation for a number of turns and identify the\ncandidate utterance in the initial hypothesis set that gives rise to the most\nlikely sequence of future utterances. We empirically validate our approach by\nconducting human evaluation using the Persona-Chat dataset, and find that our\nmulti-turn beam search generates significantly better dialogue responses. We\npropose three approximations to the partner model, and observe that more\ninformed partner models give better performance.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-01T03:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-12T14:16:25Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Temporal Embeddings and Transformer Models for Narrative Text\n  Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Vani K, Simone Mellace, Alessandro Antonucci*\n\n**Abstract:** We present two deep learning approaches to narrative text understanding for\ncharacter relationship modelling. The temporal evolution of these relations is\ndescribed by dynamic word embeddings, that are designed to learn semantic\nchanges over time. An empirical analysis of the corresponding character\ntrajectories shows that such approaches are effective in depicting dynamic\nevolution. A supervised learning approach based on the state-of-the-art\ntransformer model BERT is used instead to detect static relations between\ncharacters. The empirical validation shows that such events (e.g., two\ncharacters belonging to the same family) might be spotted with good accuracy,\neven when using automatically annotated data. This provides a deeper\nunderstanding of narrative plots based on the identification of key facts.\nStandard clustering techniques are finally used for character de-aliasing, a\nnecessary pre-processing step for both approaches. Overall, deep learning\nmodels appear to be suitable for narrative text understanding, while also\nproviding a challenging and unexploited benchmark for general natural language\nunderstanding.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-19T14:23:12Z  (*Updated: 2020-03-19T14:23:12Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. PocketLLM: Enabling On-Device Fine-Tuning for Personalized LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Dan Peng, Zhihui Fu, Jun Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have indeed showcased\ntheir impressive capabilities. On mobile devices, the wealth of valuable,\nnon-public data generated daily holds great promise for locally fine-tuning\npersonalized LLMs, while maintaining privacy through on-device processing.\nHowever, the constraints of mobile device resources pose challenges to direct\non-device LLM fine-tuning, mainly due to the memory-intensive nature of\nderivative-based optimization required for saving gradients and optimizer\nstates. To tackle this, we propose employing derivative-free optimization\ntechniques to enable on-device fine-tuning of LLM, even on memory-limited\nmobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate that the RoBERTa-large model and\nOPT-1.3B can be fine-tuned locally on the OPPO Reno 6 smartphone using around\n4GB and 6.5GB of memory respectively, using derivative-free optimization\ntechniques. This highlights the feasibility of on-device LLM fine-tuning on\nmobile devices, paving the way for personalized LLMs on resource-constrained\ndevices while safeguarding data privacy.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-01T07:26:56Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-01T07:26:56Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

R2D2: Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Tree for\n  Interpretable Hierarchical Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Xiang Hu, Haitao Mi, Zujie Wen, Yafang Wang, Yi Su, Jing Zheng, Gerard de Melo*\n\n**Abstract:** Human language understanding operates at multiple levels of granularity\n(e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) with increasing levels of abstraction\nthat can be hierarchically combined.

In the present work, we introduce\nhierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the\nU-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of\nnatural images.

Validation of semi-analytical, semi-empirical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for Early DESI data\n\n*From Search Query: empirical validation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an extended validation of semi-analytical, semi-empirical covariance matrices for the two-point correlation function (2PCF) on simulated catalogs representative of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) data collected during the initial two months of operations of the Stage-IV ground-based Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We run the pipeline on multiple effective Zel'dovich (EZ) mock galaxy catalogs with the corresponding cuts applied and compare the results with the mock sample covariance to assess the accuracy and its fluctuations. We propose an extension of the previously developed formalism for catalogs processed with standard reconstruction algorithms. We consider methods for comparing covariance matrices in detail, highlighting their interpretation and statistical properties caused by sample variance, in particular, nontrivial expectation values of certain metrics even when the external covariance estimate is perfect. With improved mocks and validation techniques, we confirm a good agreement between our predictions and sample covariance. This allows one to generate covariance matrices for comparable datasets without the need to create numerous mock galaxy catalogs with matching clustering, only requiring 2PCF measurements from the data itself.

Here we study ridge regression when the analyst can partition the features into $K$ groups based on external side-information. For example, in high-throughput biology, features may represent gene expression, protein abundance or clinical data and so each feature group represents a distinct modality. The analyst's goal is to choose optimal regularization parameters $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dotsc, \\lambda_K)$ -- one for each group. In this work, we study the impact of $\\lambda$ on the predictive risk of group-regularized ridge regression by deriving limiting risk formulae under a high-dimensional random effects model with $p\\asymp n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven method for choosing $\\lambda$ that attains the optimal asymptotic risk: The key idea is to interpret the residual noise variance $\\sigma^2$, as a regularization parameter to be chosen through cross-validation. An empirical Bayes construction maps the one-dimensional parameter $\\sigma$ to the $K$-dimensional vector of regularization parameters, i.e., $\\sigma \\mapsto \\widehat{\\lambda}(\\sigma)$. Beyond its theoretical optimality, the proposed method is practical and runs as fast as cross-validated ridge regression without feature groups ($K=1$).\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gradient Centralization: A New Optimization Technique for Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Xian-Sheng Hua, Jianqiang Huang, Lei Zhang, Hongwei Yong*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimization techniques are of great importance to effectively and efficiently train a deep neural network (DNN). It has been shown that using the first and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training performance. Different from these existing methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more efficient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to fine-tune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classification, fine-grained image classification, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning. The code of GC can be found at https://github.com/Yonghongwei/Gradient-Centralization.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. Implicit bulk-surface filtering method for node-based shape optimization and comparison of explicit and implicit filtering techniques\n\n*From Search Query: optimization techniques*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This work studies shape filtering techniques, namely the convolution-based (explicit) and the PDE-based (implicit), and introduces an implicit bulk-surface filtering method to control the boundary smoothness and preserve the internal mesh quality simultaneously in the course of bulk (solid) shape optimization. To that end, volumetric mesh is filtered by the solution of pseudo-solid governing equations which are stiffened by the mesh-Jacobian and endowed with the Robin boundary condition which involves the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the mesh boundaries. Its superior performance from the non-simultaneous (sequential) treatment of boundary and internal meshes is demonstrated for the shape optimization of a complex solid structure. Well-established explicit filters, namely Gaussian and linear, and the Helmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter are critically examined in terms of consistency (rigid-body-movement production), geometric characteristics and the computational cost. It is shown that the implicit filtering is numerically more efficient and unconditionally consistent, compared to the explicit one. Supported by numerical experiments, a regularized Green's function is introduced as an equivalent explicit form of the Helmholtz/Sobolev filter. Furthermore, we give special attention to derive mesh-independent filtered sensitivities for node-based shape optimization with non-uniform meshes. It is shown that the mesh independent filtering can be achieved by scaling discrete sensitivities with the inverse of the mesh mass matrix.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-01\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/39 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads.

CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Adafactor: Adaptive Learning Rates with Sublinear Memory Cost\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Noam M. Shazeer, Mitchell Stern*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work demonstrates empirically that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow, and proposes update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies.\n\n**Abstract:** In several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods (e.g. RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta), parameter updates are scaled by the inverse square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. Maintaining these per-parameter second-moment estimators requires memory equal to the number of parameters. For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums. We demonstrate empirically that this method produces similar results to the baseline. Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies. Combining these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to the published Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task, while using very little auxiliary storage in the optimizer. Finally, we propose scaling the parameter updates based on the scale of the parameters themselves.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 901  (*Influential: 159*)\n\n#### 3. Block Low-Rank Preconditioner with Shared Basis for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Jui-Nan Yen, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer within each layer, and designs an algorithm to maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive methods with non-diagonal preconditioning have shown state-of-the-art results on various tasks. However, their computational complexity and memory requirement make it challenging to scale these methods to modern neural network architectures. To address this challenge, some previous works have adopted block-diagonal preconditioners. However, the memory cost of storing the block-diagonal matrix remains substantial, leading to the use of smaller block sizes that ultimately leads to suboptimal performance. To reduce the time and memory complexity without sacri\ufb01cing performance, we propose approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer. We provide theoretical justi\ufb01cation for such basis sharing and design an algorithm to ef\ufb01ciently maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training. Our results on a deep autoencoder and a Transformer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms \ufb01rst-order methods with slightly more time and memory usage, while also achieving competitive or superior performance compared to other second-order methods with less time and memory usage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Easy and Efficient Transformer: Scalable Inference Solution For Large NLP Model\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*GongZheng Li, Yadong Xi, Jingzhen Ding, Duan Wang, Bai Liu, Changjie Fan, Xiaoxi Mao, Zeng Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels, and a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, large-scale transformer-based models have been proven to be effective over various tasks across many domains. Nevertheless, applying them in industrial production requires tedious and heavy works to reduce inference costs. To fill such a gap, we introduce a scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels. First, we design highly optimized kernels for long inputs and large hidden sizes. Second, we propose a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model. Compared with the state-of-the-art transformer inference library (Faster Transformer v4.0), EET can achieve an average of 1.40-4.20x speedup on the transformer decoder layer with an A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Diederik P.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 141442  (*Influential: 22289*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Tutorial and Open Source Software for the Efficient Evaluation of Gravity and Magnetic Kernels\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Saeed Vatankhah, Rosemary A Renaut, Jarom D Hogue*\n\n**Abstract:** Fast computation of three-dimensional gravity and magnetic forward models is considered. Measurement data is assumed to be obtained on a uniform grid which is staggered with respect to the discretization of the parameter volume. Then, the resulting kernel sensitivity matrices exhibit block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block (BTTB) structure. These matrices are symmetric for the gravity problem but non-symmetric for the magnetic problem. In each case, the structure facilitates fast forward computation using two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms. The construction of the kernel matrices and the application of the transform for fast forward multiplication, for each problem, is carefully described. But, for purposes of comparison with the transform approach, the generation of the unique entries that define a given kernel matrix is also explained. It is also demonstrated how the matrices, and hence transforms, are adjusted when padding around the volume domain is introduced. The transform algorithms for fast forward matrix multiplication with the sensitivity matrix and its transpose, without the direct construction of the relevant matrices, are presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant reduction in computation time that is achieved using the transform implementation. Moreover, it becomes feasible, both in terms of reduced memory requirements and computational time, to implement the transform algorithms for large three-dimensional volumes. All presented algorithms, including with variable padding, are coded for optimal memory, storage and computation as an open source MATLAB code which can be adapted for any convolution kernel which generates a BTTB matrix. This work, therefore, provides a general tool for the efficient simulation of gravity and magnetic field data, as well as any formulation which admits a sensitivity matrix with the required structure.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Iterative compilation on mobile devices\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory optimization transformer implementation*\n\n*Pavlos Petoumenos, Hugh Leather, Paschalis Mpeis*\n\n**Abstract:** The abundance of poorly optimized mobile applications coupled with their\nincreasing centrality in our digital lives make a framework for mobile app\noptimization an imperative. While tuning strategies for desktop and server\napplications have a long history, it is difficult to adapt them for use on\nmobile phones.\n  Reference inputs which trigger behavior similar to a mobile application's\ntypical are hard to construct. For many classes of applications the very\nconcept of typical behavior is nonexistent, each user interacting with the\napplication in very different ways. In contexts like this, optimization\nstrategies need to evaluate their effectiveness against real user input, but\ndoing so online runs the risk of user dissatisfaction when suboptimal\noptimizations are evaluated.\n  In this paper we present an iterative compiler which employs a novel capture\nand replay technique in order to collect real user input and use it later to\nevaluate different transformations offline. The proposed mechanism identifies\nand stores only the set of memory pages needed to replay the most heavily used\nfunctions of the application. At idle periods, this minimal state is combined\nwith different binaries of the application, each one build with different\noptimizations enabled. Replaying the targeted functions allows us to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of each set of optimizations for the actual way the user\ninteracts with the application.\n  For the BEEBS benchmark suite, our approach was able to improve performance\nby up to 57%, while keeping the slowdown experienced by the user on average at\n0.8%. By focusing only on heavily used functions, we are able to conserve\nstorage space by between two and three orders of magnitude compared to typical\ncapture and replay implementations.\n\n**Published:** 2015-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on adaptive memory optimization, efficient attention mechanisms, performance benchmarks, and production-scale deployment, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Adaptive Memory Optimization Techniques in Transformers\n\n- **Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)**: This approach introduces a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. NAMMs evolve atop pre-trained transformers to focus on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads, reducing the input context size while improving performance across multiple long-context benchmarks.\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Transformers (Memformers)**: These models use memory registers to store intermediate attention values, enabling the implementation of complex optimization methods such as conjugate gradient descent and momentum methods. This approach enhances the algorithmic capabilities of transformers and improves their performance on various tasks.\n\n## Implementation Details of Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Recursive Transformers**: This architecture reuses parameters across layers, significantly reducing the memory footprint and increasing throughput. The use of Multi-LoRA layers allows for enhanced flexibility by adjusting the shared layers differently at each repetition, capturing a broader range of features without additional cost.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: The H-Transformer-1D, for example, exploits a hierarchical matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix), achieving linear run time and memory complexity. This approach is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals and shows promising results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n## Performance Benchmarks for Memory-Optimized Transformers\n\n- **NAMMs Performance**: Training NAMMs on top of pre-trained transformer models results in substantial performance improvements across 36 different tasks from LongBench, InfiniteBench, and ChouBun benchmarks. NAMMs also achieve efficiency benefits with significant reductions in the number of retained tokens in the KV cache.\n\n- **Memformers Performance**: Memformers trained on linear regression tasks learn linear first-order optimization methods (LFOMs) that outperform conjugate gradient descent on training data and remain competitive on test data, indicating good generalization performance.\n\n## Production-Scale Deployment of Memory-Efficient Architectures\n\n- **Memristor-Based Hardware Acceleration**: This approach leverages memristor-based in-memory computing to accelerate transformer self-attention mechanisms. The design demonstrates a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts, with significant improvements in power consumption and latency. This method is particularly relevant for production-scale deployment due to its efficiency and scalability.\n\n- **Recursive Transformers Deployment**: The reduced memory footprint and increased throughput of Recursive Transformers make them highly suitable for production-scale deployment. This architecture can achieve greater depth of analysis with fewer parameters, cutting deployment costs without compromising performance.\n\nThese findings and references provide valuable insights into adaptive memory optimization techniques, efficient attention mechanisms, performance benchmarks, and considerations for production-scale deployment, all of which are crucial for improving autoregressive language model design.\n",

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/10 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers \n\nSai Sena Chinnakonduru ${ }^{\\dagger}$, Astarag Mohapatra ${ }^{\\dagger}$<br>Indiana University Bloomington<br>saischin@iu.edu, astmohap@iu.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models.\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/40 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nCurran Associates, Inc.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

GQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*J. Ainslie, J. Lee-Thorp, Michiel de Jong, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Federico Lebr'on, Sumit K. Sanghai*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and introduces grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi- query attention which uses an intermediate number of query heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 333  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 2. Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Cross-Layer Retrospective Retrieving via Layer Attention\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yanwen Fang, Yuxi Cai, Jintai Chen, Jingyu Zhao, Guangjian Tian, Guodong Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields to enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks.\n\n**Abstract:** More and more evidence has shown that strengthening layer interactions can enhance the representation power of a deep neural network, while self-attention excels at learning interdependencies by retrieving query-activated information. Motivated by this, we devise a cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields. A light-weighted version of MRLA is also proposed to reduce the quadratic computation cost. The proposed layer attention mechanism can enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks, including CNNs and vision transformers. Its effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, where improvements can be consistently observed. For example, our MRLA can improve 1.6% Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50, while only introducing 0.16M parameters and 0.07B FLOPs. Surprisingly, it can boost the performances by a large margin of 3-4% box AP and mask AP in dense prediction tasks.

Fast Multipole Attention: A Divide-and-Conquer Attention Mechanism for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: weighted grouped query attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Hans De Sterck, Giang Tran, Yanming Kang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many areas. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the input length hinders the applicability of Transformer-based models to long sequences. To address this, we present Fast Multipole Attention, a new attention mechanism that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the time and memory complexity of attention for sequences of length $n$ from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ or $O(n)$, while retaining a global receptive field. The hierarchical approach groups queries, keys, and values into $\\mathcal{O}( \\log n)$ levels of resolution, where groups at greater distances are increasingly larger in size and the weights to compute group quantities are learned. As such, the interaction between tokens far from each other is considered in lower resolution in an efficient hierarchical manner. The overall complexity of Fast Multipole Attention is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$, depending on whether the queries are down-sampled or not. This multi-level divide-and-conquer strategy is inspired by fast summation methods from $n$-body physics and the Fast Multipole Method. We perform evaluation on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling tasks and compare our Fast Multipole Attention model with other efficient attention variants on medium-size datasets. We find empirically that the Fast Multipole Transformer performs much better than other efficient transformers in terms of memory size and accuracy. The Fast Multipole Attention mechanism has the potential to empower large language models with much greater sequence lengths, taking the full context into account in an efficient, naturally hierarchical manner during training and when generating long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using weighted grouped query attention, hierarchical processing, and memory optimization, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Details of Weighted Grouped Query Attention\n\n- **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)**: This mechanism involves grouping query heads into groups, with each group sharing a single key and value. This approach balances computational efficiency and the model's capacity to learn complex relationships. GQA reduces memory use by combining multiple queries, although it may lead to less precise attention distribution, especially in long contexts[4|.\n  - In the context of the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT), GQA is integrated with the Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) to form the Grouped Query Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (GQDAAM). This integration optimizes computational efficiency while maintaining compatibility with dot-product attention in popular models.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: Hierarchical processing can be achieved by combining different attention mechanisms. For instance, the use of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and GQA can be hierarchical, where GQA serves as an intermediary between MHA and Multi-Query Attention (MQA). This hierarchical structure allows for more efficient and effective capture of complex patterns and dependencies[1|.\n  - The proposal of integrating weighted grouped query attention with hierarchical processing suggests a novel combination that could enhance model efficiency and expressiveness. This would involve analyzing how different levels of attention can be hierarchically organized to focus on various aspects of the input sequence.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- **DuoAttention**: This mechanism categorizes attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming types, each with different caching strategies. Retrieval Heads use a full key-value (KV) cache to retain long-term context, while Streaming Heads use a reduced, constant-length cache to focus on recent tokens. This approach optimizes memory usage without compromising model performance[4|.\n  - **State Reuse Strategies**: Techniques like State Memory Replay (SMR) for long sequence modeling emphasize the reuse of state information to reduce memory overhead. These strategies can be crucial in optimizing memory management for hierarchical and grouped query attention mechanisms[6 (implied from the initial analysis)].\n\n## Integration of Adaptive Mechanisms with Existing Transformer Blocks\n\n- **Integration with DAAM**: The integration of DAAM with GQA (GQDAAM) demonstrates how adaptive attention mechanisms can be combined with existing transformer blocks. This integration allows for dynamic recalibration of feature importance and enhances the model\u2019s ability to focus on contextually relevant information[1|.\n  - **Compatibility with FastTTTLinear**: The proposal involves integrating weighted grouped query attention with the FastTTTLinear architecture. This requires analyzing the compatibility and potential modifications needed to ensure seamless integration without compromising computational efficiency[Initial Analysis].\n\n## Technical Details, Memory Management, and Performance Metrics\n\n- **Technical Details**: The implementation of GQA involves grouping query heads and sharing keys and values within these groups. This can be formulated as a balance between MHA and MQA, providing a hierarchical learning structure[3|.\n  - **Memory Management**: Techniques such as caching and pruning, as seen in DuoAttention, are crucial for managing memory efficiently. These strategies ensure that the model retains critical context while minimizing memory allocation[4|.\n  - **Performance Metrics and Benchmarks**: Evaluating the performance of such models involves comparing them against existing state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness, and efficiency. Metrics such as computational complexity and memory usage are also important benchmarks.\n\n## Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n- **Implementation Challenges**: Integrating weighted grouped query attention with hierarchical processing and existing architectures like FastTTTLinear can be challenging. This involves ensuring compatibility, optimizing memory usage, and maintaining computational efficiency[Initial Analysis].\n  - **Solutions**: Using adaptive mechanisms like DAAM, employing state reuse strategies, and optimizing attention head classification (as in DuoAttention) can help address these challenges. Additionally, careful analysis of synthetic data to evaluate the importance of each attention head can optimize resource allocation.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and adaptive autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of weighted grouped query attention, hierarchical processing, and advanced memory management techniques.\n",

The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Increasing the Scope as You Learn: Adaptive Bayesian Optimization in Nested Subspaces\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Leonard Papenmeier, Luigi Nardi, Matthias Poloczek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes BAxUS that leverages a novel family of nested random subspaces to adapt the space it optimizes over to the problem and ensures high performance while removing the risk of failure, which it asserts via theoretical guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances have extended the scope of Bayesian optimization (BO) to expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions with dozens of dimensions, aspiring to unlock impactful applications, for example, in the life sciences, neural architecture search, and robotics. However, a closer examination reveals that the state-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) suffer from degrading performance as the number of dimensions increases or even risk failure if certain unverifiable assumptions are not met. This paper proposes BAxUS that leverages a novel family of nested random subspaces to adapt the space it optimizes over to the problem. This ensures high performance while removing the risk of failure, which we assert via theoretical guarantees. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that BAxUS achieves better results than the state-of-the-art methods for a broad set of applications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

FAMO: Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*B. Liu, Yihao Feng, Peter Stone, Qian Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** FAMO is introduced, a dynamic weighting method that decreases task losses in a balanced way using space and time that achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art gradient manipulation techniques while offering significant improvements in space and computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the grand enduring goals of AI is to create generalist agents that can learn multiple different tasks from diverse data via multitask learning (MTL). However, in practice, applying gradient descent (GD) on the average loss across all tasks may yield poor multitask performance due to severe under-optimization of certain tasks. Previous approaches that manipulate task gradients for a more balanced loss decrease require storing and computing all task gradients ($\\mathcal{O}(k)$ space and time where $k$ is the number of tasks), limiting their use in large-scale scenarios. In this work, we introduce Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization FAMO, a dynamic weighting method that decreases task losses in a balanced way using $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ space and time. We conduct an extensive set of experiments covering multi-task supervised and reinforcement learning problems. Our results indicate that FAMO achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art gradient manipulation techniques while offering significant improvements in space and computational efficiency.

LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Thomas Robert*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce LDAdam, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large models, that performs adaptive optimization steps within lower dimensional subspaces, while consistently exploring the full parameter space during training. This strategy keeps the optimizer's memory footprint to a fraction of the model size. LDAdam relies on a new projection-aware update rule for the optimizer states that allows for transitioning between subspaces, i.e., estimation of the statistics of the projected gradients. To mitigate the errors due to low-rank projection, LDAdam integrates a new generalized error feedback mechanism, which explicitly accounts for both gradient and optimizer state compression. We prove the convergence of LDAdam under standard assumptions, and show that LDAdam allows for accurate and efficient fine-tuning and pre-training of language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. EAST: Encoding-Aware Sparse Training for Deep Memory Compression of ConvNets\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression state space memory optimization*\n\n*Valentino Peluso, Andrea Calimera, Matteo Grimaldi*\n\n**Abstract:** The implementation of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) on tiny end-nodes with limited non-volatile memory space calls for smart compression strategies capable of shrinking the footprint yet preserving predictive accuracy. There exist a number of strategies for this purpose, from those that play with the topology of the model or the arithmetic precision, e.g. pruning and quantization, to those that operate a model agnostic compression, e.g. weight encoding. The tighter the memory constraint, the higher the probability that these techniques alone cannot meet the requirement, hence more awareness and cooperation across different optimizations become mandatory. This work addresses the issue by introducing EAST, Encoding-Aware Sparse Training, a novel memory-constrained training procedure that leads quantized ConvNets towards deep memory compression. EAST implements an adaptive group pruning designed to maximize the compression rate of the weight encoding scheme (the LZ4 algorithm in this work). If compared to existing methods, EAST meets the memory constraint with lower sparsity, hence ensuring higher accuracy. Results conducted on a state-of-the-art ConvNet (ResNet-9) deployed on a low-power microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M4) validate the proposal.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory optimization, adaptive compression, and state management, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in State-Space Models\n\nState-space models (SSMs) have been explored for their efficiency in handling long sequences, which is relevant for autoregressive language models.\n\n- The paper on \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\" highlights that SSMs, such as S4, achieve efficient training and inference by leveraging their linearity and adopting a convolutional form during training. This enables parallel computation and reduces memory usage.\n\n## Adaptive Compression Mechanisms for Transformer Architectures\n\nSeveral techniques have been developed to reduce memory footprint and improve efficiency in transformer architectures:\n\n- **Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore)**: This method approximates the optimizer states by exploiting the low-rank structure of gradients, reducing memory usage without compromising model performance. This can be particularly useful for large language models.\n\n- **Learning Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)**: LoRA and its variants, such as ReLoRA, reduce memory usage during fine-tuning by using low-rank adapters. These methods enable large models to be adapted to new tasks with minimal additional memory overhead.\n\n- **Gradient Checkpointing**: This technique reduces memory usage by selectively storing only a subset of activations during the forward pass and recomputing them during the backward pass as needed. This approach trades increased computational overhead for reduced memory consumption.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Different Attention Mechanisms\n\nFor integrating different attention mechanisms, such as hierarchical processing and weighted grouped query attention, the following insights are relevant:\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Methods like Fast Multipole Attention group queries, keys, and values into multiple resolution levels, enabling efficient computation of attention weights. This hierarchical approach can be integrated with other attention mechanisms to improve long-range dependency modeling [Analysis Note].\n\n- **Weighted Grouped Query Attention**: This mechanism introduces learnable parameters for key-value heads, enabling weighted averaging during processing. Integrating this with hierarchical attention mechanisms could enhance efficiency and performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## State Management and Caching Strategies for Long Sequences\n\nEffective state management is crucial for handling long sequences in autoregressive models:\n\n- **State-Space Models**: SSMs maintain a hidden state to encapsulate the information of previous tokens, which enhances inference efficiency. The linearity of SSMs allows for efficient state management and caching strategies, particularly when combined with convolutional forms during training.\n\n- **Memory Offloading and Sharding**: Techniques like ZeRO-Offload and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) move optimizer states and gradients to CPU memory or partition them across multiple devices, reducing memory footprint and enabling the training of larger models.\n\n### Implementation Details and Performance Metrics\n\n- **Implementation Details**: For SSMs, the implementation involves setting up the state space representation, defining the transition and design matrices, and updating parameters efficiently. This can be customized to fit specific models like the AR2 model example.\n\n- **Performance Metrics and Trade-offs**: The performance of these models is often evaluated based on metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs. Memory efficiency strategies often trade off against computational overhead or model performance. For example, GaLore and LoRA reduce memory usage but may introduce additional computational steps.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that balance memory efficiency with performance.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.

History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Recurrent Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 85  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer implementation memory*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention mechanisms, memory efficiency, and integration techniques, here are some key points and references that can be helpful:\n\n## Implementation Details of Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on \"Nova\" introduces a hierarchical self-attention mechanism specifically designed for assembly code, which can be adapted for other sequence tasks. This mechanism includes intra-instruction attention, preceding-instruction attention, and inter-instruction attention. These categories help capture semantics at different levels of granularity, which can be beneficial for long sequences and low-information-density data.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Architectures\n\n- The use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention is discussed in a paper that highlights an efficient hardware accelerator. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing the computational latency and the number of operations required for matrix multiplications in self-attention mechanisms. This can significantly improve memory efficiency and reduce the number of MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) operations.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The \"Nova\" paper provides performance comparisons between the proposed hierarchical attention mechanism and standard attention mechanisms. Nova outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as binary decompilation and binary similarity detection, indicating the effectiveness of hierarchical attention in capturing long-range dependencies and handling diverse syntax.\n\n## Integration Techniques for Combining Multiple Attention Types\n\n- The integration of different attention mechanisms can be seen in the \"Nova\" paper, where hierarchical self-attention is combined with standard self-attention. This is done by applying hierarchical attention on half of the attention heads while keeping the standard causal attention mask for text and source code. This approach balances the effectiveness of the new mechanism with the existing knowledge in standard attention layers.\n\n- The concept of dense connections and selective integration of hidden states, as mentioned in the \"DenseMamba\" and \"StableSSM\" references, can be applied to integrate multiple attention types. For example, selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers can enhance information retention and maintain training parallelizability and inference efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Architectural Details and Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n- Transformer models inherently process data in parallel, which is a significant advantage over sequential models like LSTMs. The use of positional encoding and multi-head attention allows transformers to capture both local and global relationships efficiently. This parallel processing capability is crucial for handling large datasets and long-range dependencies.\n\n- For memory efficiency, techniques such as using special memory tokens, reparameterization schemes, and adaptive learning rates can be employed. For instance, adding memory tokens to the input or output sequence without modifying the core architecture can enhance information passing and retention[Analysis Note].\n\n## Performance Metrics and Integration Challenges\n\n- Performance metrics such as Pass@k and Recall@1 are used in the \"Nova\" paper to evaluate the effectiveness of the hierarchical attention mechanism. These metrics highlight the improvement in performance when using hierarchical attention compared to standard attention mechanisms.\n\n- Integration challenges include balancing efficiency and effectiveness. Techniques like dense connections and selective state integration can help maintain efficiency while improving information flow. Reparameterization techniques can also enhance optimization stability and memory capabilities[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can design an autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms, optimizes memory usage through efficient hardware and software techniques, and integrates multiple attention types to achieve better overall performance.\n",
