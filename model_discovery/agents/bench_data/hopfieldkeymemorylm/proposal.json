This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns.

We have introduced a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and the corresponding new update rule. This network can store exponentially many patterns, retrieves patterns with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. We analyzed the attention heads of BERT models. The new modern Hopfield networks have been integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. Hopfield layers that equip neural network layers with memories improved state-of-the-art in three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems and on immune repertoire classification, and on two drug design dataset. They yielded the best results among different machine learning methods on the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe ELLIS Unit Linz, the LIT AI Lab and the Institute for Machine Learning are supported by the Land Ober\u00f6sterreich, LIT grants DeepToxGen (LIT-2017-3-YOU-003), and AI-SNN (LIT2018-6-YOU-214), the Medical Cognitive Computing Center (MC3), Janssen Pharmaceutica, UCB Biopharma, Merck Group, Audi.JKU Deep Learning Center, Audi Electronic Venture GmbH, TGW, Primal, S3AI (FFG-872172), Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), Anyline, FILL, EnliteAI, Google Brain, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, T\u00dcV Austria, DCS, and the NVIDIA Corporation.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Salakhutdinov*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2019)\t**Cited by** 3248  (*Influential: 394*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence, which consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nOfir Press and Lior Wolf. 2016.

Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 93  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, Scatterbrain is proposed, a novel way to unify sparse and low-rank attention for accurate and efficient approximation and is unbiased with provably low error.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity or low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and memory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/51 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1910.10683, 2019.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/97 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 1910.10683, 2019.

Universal Hopfield Networks: A General Framework for Single-Shot Associative Memory Models\n\n*From Search Query: hopfield networks attention memory*\n\n*Beren Millidge, Tommaso Salvatori, Yuhang Song, Thomas Lukasiewicz, R. Bogacz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper extends the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derives a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics.\n\n**Abstract:** A large number of neural network models of associative memory have been proposed in the literature. These include the classical Hopfield networks (HNs), sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern continuous Hopfield networks (MCHNs), which possess close links with self-attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a general framework for understanding the operation of such memory networks as a sequence of three operations: similarity, separation, and projection. We derive all these memory models as instances of our general framework with differing similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derive a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics. Finally, using our framework, we empirically investigate the capacity of using different similarity functions for these associative memory models, beyond the dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically that Euclidean or Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better in practice on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity than existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

Our paper provides a unified framework for sparse Hopfield networks by establishing a link with Fenchel-Young losses. The result is a new family of Hopfield-Fenchel-Young energies whose update rules are end-to-end differentiable sparse transformations. We reveal a connection between loss margins, sparsity, and exact memory retrieval. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks via the SparseMAP transformation, which can retrieve pattern associations instead of a single pattern.

Simplicial Hopfield networks\n\n*From Search Query: hopfield networks attention memory*\n\n*Thomas F Burns, T. Fukai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, these networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** Hopfield networks are artificial neural networks which store memory patterns on the states of their neurons by choosing recurrent connection weights and update rules such that the energy landscape of the network forms attractors around the memories. How many stable, sufficiently-attracting memory patterns can we store in such a network using $N$ neurons? The answer depends on the choice of weights and update rule. Inspired by setwise connectivity in biology, we extend Hopfield networks by adding setwise connections and embedding these connections in a simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are higher dimensional analogues of graphs which naturally represent collections of pairwise and setwise relationships. We show that our simplicial Hopfield networks increase memory storage capacity. Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, our networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts. Such scenarios include non-trivial simplicial topology. We also test analogous modern continuous Hopfield networks, offering a potentially promising avenue for improving the attention mechanism in Transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Hopfield Networks is All You Need\n\n*From Search Query: hopfield networks attention memory*\n\n*Thomas Adler, Sepp Hochreiter, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Milena Pavlovi\u0107, Markus Holzleitner, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl, Victor Greiff, Michael Widrich, Michael Kopp, Johannes Brandstetter, Hubert Ramsauer, Lukas Gruber, Philipp Seidl, Johannes Lehner, Geir Kjetil Sandve, David Kreil*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets.

Tree Attention: Topology-aware Decoding for Long-Context Attention on GPU clusters\n\n*From Search Query: hopfield networks attention memory*\n\n*Beren Millidge, Quentin Anthony, Emily Shepperd, Jonathan Pilault, Vasudev Shyam*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer architectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity in the sequence length. In this work, we derive the scalar energy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with energy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction. Our algorithm, for parallelizing attention computation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed asymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than alternative approaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less communication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory.

Energy Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hopfield networks attention memory*\n\n*Dmitry Krotov, Mohammed J. Zaki, Duen Horng Chau, Hendrik Strobelt, Rameswar Panda, Bao Pham, Yuchen Liang, Benjamin Hoover*\n\n**Abstract:** Our work combines aspects of three promising paradigms in machine learning, namely, attention mechanism, energy-based models, and associative memory. Attention is the power-house driving modern deep learning successes, but it lacks clear theoretical foundations. Energy-based models allow a principled approach to discriminative and generative tasks, but the design of the energy functional is not straightforward. At the same time, Dense Associative Memory models or Modern Hopfield Networks have a well-established theoretical foundation, and allow an intuitive design of the energy function. We propose a novel architecture, called the Energy Transformer (or ET for short), that uses a sequence of attention layers that are purposely designed to minimize a specifically engineered energy function, which is responsible for representing the relationships between the tokens. In this work, we introduce the theoretical foundations of ET, explore its empirical capabilities using the image completion task, and obtain strong quantitative results on the graph anomaly detection and graph classification tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating Hopfield networks, associative memory, and attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Integration of Hopfield Networks and Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hopfield Networks as Attention Updates**: The work \"Hopfield Networks is All You Need\" suggests that transformer attention mechanisms can be viewed as updates of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This integration allows for the storage of exponentially many patterns with fast convergence and small retrieval errors, which is highly beneficial for efficient pattern storage in language models[5,.\n\n## Efficient Pattern Storage and Retrieval\n\n- **Modern Hopfield Networks**: These networks can store and retrieve patterns efficiently, even with incomplete or distorted information. This property can enhance the memory capabilities of language models, allowing them to recall context and patterns more accurately.\n\n## Memory Management and Attention\n\n- **Associative Memory**: Hopfield networks serve as content-addressable memory systems, which can recover memories based on similarity. Integrating this with attention mechanisms can help language models manage memory more effectively, focusing on relevant context and patterns during inference.\n\n## Efficiency Considerations\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: The \"Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\" approach approximates softmax attention with linear time and space complexity, which can significantly reduce the computational cost while maintaining effectiveness.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Score: 0.83)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: sparse hopfield networks implementation memory management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

These include the classical Hopfield networks (HNs), sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern continuous Hopfield networks (MCHNs), which possess close links with self-attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a general framework for understanding the operation of such memory networks as a sequence of three operations: similarity, separation, and projection. We derive all these memory models as instances of our general framework with differing similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derive a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics. Finally, using our framework, we empirically investigate the capacity of using different similarity functions for these associative memory models, beyond the dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically that Euclidean or Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better in practice on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity than existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

At the heart of our approach is STanHop, a novel Hopfield-based neural network block, which sparsely learns and stores both temporal and cross-series representations in a data-dependent fashion. In essence, STanHop sequentially learn temporal representation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield layers. In addition, StanHop incorporates two additional external memory modules: a Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and task-aware memory-enhancements, respectively. They allow StanHop-Net to swiftly respond to certain sudden events. Methodologically, we construct the StanHop-Net by stacking STanHop blocks in a hierarchical fashion, enabling multi-resolution feature extraction with resolution-specific sparsity. Theoretically, we introduce a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model (Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) and show that it endows a tighter memory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing memory capacity. Empirically, we validate the efficacy of our framework on both synthetic and real-world settings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Computational models of sequence memory have been proposed where recurrent Hopfield-like neural networks are trained with temporally asymmetric Hebbian rules. However, these networks suffer from limited sequence capacity (maximal length of the stored sequence) due to interference between the memories. Inspired by recent work on Dense Associative Memories, we expand the sequence capacity of these models by introducing a nonlinear interaction term, enhancing separation between the patterns. We derive novel scaling laws for sequence capacity with respect to network size, significantly outperforming existing scaling laws for models based on traditional Hopfield networks, and verify these theoretical results with numerical simulation. Moreover, we introduce a generalized pseudoinverse rule to recall sequences of highly correlated patterns. Finally, we extend this model to store sequences with variable timing between states\u2019 transitions and describe a biologically-plausible implementation, with connections to motor neuroscience.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

For instance, simpicial Hopfield networks, which limit connections to a small random subset, can still outperform all-pairwise networks in terms of memory storage capacity.\n- The use of structured and sparse connections in Hopfield networks can enhance memory retrieval and pattern storage. This is achieved by linking sparse Hopfield networks with Fenchel-Young losses, which provides a unified framework for end-to-end differentiable transformations[Analysis Note, \"Sparse and Structured Hopfield Networks\"].\n\n### Practical Aspects and Performance\n- Modern Hopfield models, such as Kernelized Hopfield Models (KHMs), offer transformer-compatible architectures that can integrate well with existing neural network frameworks. These models can provide optimal memorization capacity and fast convergence, which are crucial for efficient language model implementations.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques in Language Models\n\n### SparseGPT and Parameter Pruning\n- The SparseGPT model provides a method for pruning parameters in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining high performance. This approach uses calibration data to prune parameters efficiently, reducing running time and GPU memory usage. The improved complexity analysis from \\(O(d^3)\\) to \\(O(d^{2.53})\\) highlights the potential for more efficient memory management in LLMs.\n\n### Energy-Based Formulations\n- Energy-based perspectives on attention mechanisms can offer insights into more efficient memory management. For example, the \"Energy Transformer\" concept can help in understanding and optimizing the energy functions underlying attention mechanisms, potentially leading to more efficient and robust models[Analysis Note, \"Energy Transformer\"].\n\n## Integration with Autoregressive Language Models\n\n### Memory-Attention Integration\n- Integrating Hopfield networks with attention mechanisms in autoregressive language models can enhance memory capacity and retrieval efficiency. The similarity, separation, and projection operations in Hopfield networks can be aligned with attention mechanisms to improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and structured data[Analysis Note, \"Universal Hopfield Networks\"].\n\n### Structured Pattern Storage\n- Using structured and sparse Hopfield networks can help in efficient setwise connections and topology-aware processing. This can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive models where maintaining context and handling long sequences are critical. The balance between memory capacity and computational efficiency is key, and structured pattern storage can help achieve this balance[Analysis Note, \"Simplicial Hopfield Networks\"].\n\n## Future Directions\n\n### Efficient Sparse Operations\n- Investigating efficient sparse operations and their implementation in Hopfield networks is crucial. This includes exploring how sparse and structured connections can be optimized for parallel processing, which is essential for large-scale language models[Analysis Note, \"Implementation Considerations\"].\n\n### Energy-Based Perspectives\n- Further research into energy-based formulations of attention mechanisms can provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing memory management and attention in autoregressive models. This could involve exploring how energy functions can be minimized to achieve efficient and robust attention mechanisms[Analysis Note, \"Energy-Based Formulations\"].\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of sparse Hopfield networks and advanced memory management techniques.\n",

The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks.

For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nThe memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate $k$ NN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262 K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing (Devlin et al.||2019|, Brown et al., 2020), mathematical reasoning (Polu \\& Sutskever, 2020, Wang et al., 2020a; Rabe et al., 2021;, Li et al., 2021; Hahn et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021), and program synthesis (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al.| 2021; Li et al.| 2022). However, transformer performance on many of these tasks is limited by the context length of attention, which is typically short. The ability to attend to far-away tokens is important in many situations. In novels, characters and events are referenced across multiple chapters. In source code, references to classes and functions may occur quite far from the places in which they are defined. In theorem proving, proofs make use of previously defined lemmas. Attention over long sequences is also useful as a form of rapid learning. Facts and information which are stored in the form of weight matrices must be slowly trained over hundreds of thousands of training steps. By using attention, however, a model can simply memorize facts (e.g. function definitions) by storing them as (key, value) pairs in long-term memory, and then retrieve those facts later by creating a query that attends to them. In this case, attention acts as a form of information retrieval, allowing the model to look up facts that it has seen previously. We demonstrate that a simple and effective way to increase the size of the attention context is to use approximate $k$-nearest-neighbor ( $k \\mathrm{NN})$ lookup, which is widely used in information retrieval. A number of extremely scalable implementations of $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup are available, such as ScaNN Guo et al., 2020) and Faiss (Johnson et al. 2021). There are two things which distinguish our approach from previous work on long-range attention (c.f. Section 22. First, unlike some other approaches, $k$ NN lookup does not do averaging or summarization of tokens at long distances, but retrieves exact values even from the distant context. Second, gradients are not backpropagated into the external memory, which is critical to the scalability of our technique. The keys and values are a function of model parameters, so attempting to backpropagate gradients into external memory would necessarily involve computing all of the keys and values with the current model parameters on every training step. However, if the external memory is not differentiable, then we can instead instead reuse keys and values that were previously computed on prior training steps, which drastically reduces the amount of computation for large memories. With\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1ef7ca414da07969fba6g-02.jpg?height=405&width=660&top_left_y=285&top_left_x=727)\n\nFigure 1: Adding a memory of 8 K tokens improves perplexity across different model sizes. our technique, we are easily able to scale external memory up to sequence lengths of 131 k or 262 k tokens on a single TPU device, while maintaining a reasonable step time. We show that model perplexity steadily improves with the size of external memory on a variety of language modelling tasks, including C 4 (long documents only), Github code repositories, PG-19 books, formal proofs in Isabelle, and arXiv math papers. We further show that models can generalize to larger memory sizes than they were trained on: models trained with a small memory show gains from using a much larger memory at inference time. Finally, we show that our models are actually using memory in the way that we had hoped, e.g. by looking up the definitions of lemmas in a theorem proving corpus. The simplicity of the changes to the Transformer architecture allows us to easily integrate this approach into existing code bases, including extremely large language models. We further show that the improvements to quality are maintained across models of increasing size, and that the model improvements gained from adding memory are even larger than increasing the size of the model by 5 X or more as shown in Figure 1\n\n## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nA great deal of work has been done on efficient long-range attention mechanisms; see Tay et al. (2020, 2021) recent surveys. Sliding windows (Beltagy et al. 2020) use a long sequence, but attend within a smaller window, thus reducing complexity to the window size, rather than total sequence length. Approximate mechanisms such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020b), and Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) refactor the attention matrix by using a different kernel than softmax to obtain $O(N)$ complexity. Pooling strategies such as Hierarchical 1D attention (Zhu \\& Soricut 2021), and Combiner (Ren et al. 2021) apply pooling or averaging over tokens at longer distances. Sparse strategies such as Big Bird (Zaheer et al. 2020) select only a subset of tokens to attend to; Routing Transformers (Roy et al., 2021) use clustering to select the subset, while Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020) relies on hashing. Hierarchical mechanisms (Ainslie et al., 2020) combine multiple tokens into phrases or sentences to reduce sequence length. Expire-span (Sukhbaatar et al., 2021) prunes far-away tokens that it learns are \"unimportant\". Zemlyanskiy et al., 2021) process long sequences in two passes with different encoders. The second pass is given a lot of context by accessing summaries of the first pass. Feedback transformers (Fan et al. 2020) use a recurrent architecture in which each token attends to the output of the final layer instead of the previous layer. Recurrence does not increase the size of the attention context itself, but it expands the receptive field at the cost of parallelism and training speed. Truncated backpropagation through time (Williams \\& Peng, 1990) was originally introduced as a way of training recurrent neural networks (RNN) over very long sequences, when the entire sequence does not fit in memory. The sequence is chopped into segments, and after each training step, the final RNN state for the segment is saved in a non-differentiable cache, and used as the initial state on the next training step. Neural caches Grave et al. 2017) extend the cache to contain a record of many prior hidden states, and attend over them. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) applies this technique to transformers; it caches the (key,value) pairs computed from the previous training step, and uses them as a prefix for the tokens on the next training step, which yields significant gains on long documents. Rae et al. (2020) improve over Transformer-XL by compressing the tokens before adding them to the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1ef7ca414da07969fba6g-03.jpg?height=665&width=1052&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=512)\n\nFigure 2: We extend Transformers with access to (key, value) pairs of previously seen subsequences. cache. In contrast, we use a very large cache without compression, combined with an approximate $k \\mathrm{NN}$ attention mechanism over it. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) make the observation that the feed-forward portion of a transformer layer functions very much like attention if one replaces the ReLU activation with softmax. They implement a combined attention over both tokens from the input sequence and a learned (and differentiable) \"memory\". Lample et al. (2019) exploit this observation to replace the feed-forward layers (FFNs) with a fast $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup over a much larger \"memory\", and achieve large gains in model accuracy without significant computation overhead. (We use $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to approximate attention to previous tokens, not to replace the FFN.)\n\nNon-differentiable external memory has been used in different ways by Khandelwal et al. (2020), who run a pre-trained model over an entire corpus, and construct a large table of (key, token) pairs. They then use that table to replace the final softmax layer for token selection in the model, which results in significant improvements in language modeling. Yogatama et al. (2021) extend this approach by a gating mechanism and a process to compress the context into keys for retrieval. There are several works that combine retrieval with transformers. REALM (Guu et al., 2020), MARGE (Lewis et al., 2020a), RAG (Lewis et al. 2020b), and composite memory for dialog (Fan et al. 2021) retrieve documents from a knowledge base to improve question answering or dialogue. The knowledge base consists of text snippets and is static and typically separate from the inputs and outputs of the models. Instead, we focus on language modeling using a decoder-only model, and propose a simple model that unifies attention and retrieval. $k$-nearest-neighbor lookup is a general-purpose technique that is used for a wide variety of machine learning and retrieval tasks, and high-performance implementations are available for various architectures (Johnson et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2020). Memory-efficient Transformers (Gupta et al, 2021) replace dense attention with a $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to increase speed and reduce memory usage. ## 3 METHOD\n\nThe architecture of our $k \\mathrm{NN}$-augmented transformer is shown in Figure 2 The bulk of the model is a vanilla, decoder-only transformer (Vaswani et al.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning).

Kernel Memory Networks: A Unifying Framework for Memory Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*Georgios Iatropoulos, Johanni Brea, W. Gerstner*\n\n**TL;DR:** The framework of kernel memory networks offers a simple and intuitive way to understand the storage capacity of previous memory models, and allows for new biological interpretations in terms of dendritic non-linearities and synaptic cross-talk.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of training a neural network to store a set of patterns with maximal noise robustness. A solution, in terms of optimal weights and state update rules, is derived by training each individual neuron to perform either kernel classification or interpolation with a minimum weight norm. By applying this method to feed-forward and recurrent networks, we derive optimal models, termed kernel memory networks, that include, as special cases, many of the hetero- and auto-associative memory models that have been proposed over the past years, such as modern Hopfield networks and Kanerva's sparse distributed memory. We modify Kanerva's model and demonstrate a simple way to design a kernel memory network that can store an exponential number of continuous-valued patterns with a finite basin of attraction. The framework of kernel memory networks offers a simple and intuitive way to understand the storage capacity of previous memory models, and allows for new biological interpretations in terms of dendritic non-linearities and synaptic cross-talk.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMS)\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*Zhikai Chen, Haitao Mao, Hongzhi Wen, Haoyu Han, Wei-dong Jin, Haiyang Zhang, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a label-free node classification on graphs with LLMs pipeline, LLM-GNN, which amalgamates the strengths of both GNNs and LLMs while mitigating their limitations while leveraging the confidence scores derived from LLMs to advanced node selection.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in node classification achieved by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, they necessitate abundant high-quality labels to ensure promising performance. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot proficiency on text-attributed graphs. Yet, they face challenges in efficiently processing structural data and suffer from high inference costs. In light of these observations, this work introduces a label-free node classification on graphs with LLMs pipeline, LLM-GNN. It amalgamates the strengths of both GNNs and LLMs while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, LLMs are leveraged to annotate a small portion of nodes and then GNNs are trained on LLMs' annotations to make predictions for the remaining large portion of nodes. The implementation of LLM-GNN faces a unique challenge: how can we actively select nodes for LLMs to annotate and consequently enhance the GNN training? How can we leverage LLMs to obtain annotations of high quality, representativeness, and diversity, thereby enhancing GNN performance with less cost? To tackle this challenge, we develop an annotation quality heuristic and leverage the confidence scores derived from LLMs to advanced node selection. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of LLM-GNN. In particular, LLM-GNN can achieve an accuracy of 74.9% on a vast-scale dataset \\products with a cost less than 1 dollar.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Massive Editing for Large Language Models via Meta Learning\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*Chenmien Tan, Ge Zhang, Jie Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN) is proposed, which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation and is capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the identical hyper-network architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have enabled learning knowledge from the pre-training corpora, the acquired knowledge may be fundamentally incorrect or outdated over time, which necessitates rectifying the knowledge of the language model (LM) after the training. A promising approach involves employing a hyper-network to generate parameter shift, whereas existing hyper-networks suffer from inferior scalability in synchronous editing operation amount. To mitigate the problem, we propose the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN), which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation. To accommodate editing multiple facts simultaneously with limited memory budgets, we separate the computation on the hyper-network and LM, enabling arbitrary batch size on both neural networks. Our method is evaluated by editing up to thousands of facts on LMs with different architectures, i.e., BERT-base, GPT-2, T5-XL (2.8B), and GPT-J (6B), across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, i.e., closed book fact-checking and question answering. Remarkably, MALMEN is capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the identical hyper-network architecture and outperforms editor specifically designed for GPT.

Language Models Implement Simple Word2Vec-style Vector Arithmetic\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*Jack Merullo, Carsten Eickhoff, Ellie Pavlick*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evidence is presented that, despite their size and complexity, LMs sometimes exploit a simple vector arithmetic style mechanism to solve some relational tasks using regularities encoded in the hidden space of the model.\n\n**Abstract:** A primary criticism towards language models (LMs) is their inscrutability. This paper presents evidence that, despite their size and complexity, LMs sometimes exploit a simple vector arithmetic style mechanism to solve some relational tasks using regularities encoded in the hidden space of the model (e.g., Poland:Warsaw::China:Beijing). We investigate a range of language model sizes (from 124M parameters to 176B parameters) in an in-context learning setting, and find that for a variety of tasks (involving capital cities, uppercasing, and past-tensing) a key part of the mechanism reduces to a simple additive update typically applied by the feedforward (FFN) networks. We further show that this mechanism is specific to tasks that require retrieval from pretraining memory, rather than retrieval from local context. Our results contribute to a growing body of work on the interpretability of LMs, and offer reason to be optimistic that, despite the massive and non-linear nature of the models, the strategies they ultimately use to solve tasks can sometimes reduce to familiar and even intuitive algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Continual Pre-training of Language Models for Math Problem Understanding with Syntax-Aware Memory Network\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*Zheng Gong, Kun Zhou, Xin Zhao, Jing Sha, Shijin Wang, J. Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new approach to continually pre-train language models for math problem understanding with syntax-aware memory network called COMUS, which can model the interaction between the token from the text and its semantic-related nodes within the formulas, which is helpful to capture fine-grained semantic correlations between texts and formulas.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we study how to continually pre-train language models for improving the understanding of math problems. Specifically, we focus on solving a fundamental challenge in modeling math problems, how to fuse the semantics of textual description and formulas, which are highly different in essence. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called COMUS to continually pre-train language models for math problem understanding with syntax-aware memory network. In this approach, we first construct the math syntax graph to model the structural semantic information, by combining the parsing trees of the text and formulas, and then design the syntax-aware memory networks to deeply fuse the features from the graph and text. With the help of syntax relations, we can model the interaction between the token from the text and its semantic-related nodes within the formulas, which is helpful to capture fine-grained semantic correlations between texts and formulas. Besides, we devise three continual pre-training tasks to further align and fuse the representations of the text and math syntax graph. Experimental results on four tasks in the math domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

SPT: Fine-Tuning Transformer-based Language Models Efficiently with Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: kernel memory networks language models implementation*\n\n*James Cheng, Han Yang, Peiqi Yin, Xiao Yan, Yuntao Gui*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (e.g., BERT and GPT) achieve great success, and fine-tuning, which tunes a pre-trained model on a task-specific dataset, is the standard practice to utilize these models for downstream tasks. However, Transformer fine-tuning has long running time and high memory consumption due to the large size of the models. We propose the SPT system to fine-tune Transformer-based models efficiently by introducing sparsity. We observe that the memory consumption of Transformer mainly comes from storing attention weights for multi-head attention (MHA), and the majority of running time is spent on feed-forward network (FFN). Thus, we design the sparse MHA module, which computes and stores only large attention weights to reduce memory consumption, and the routed FFN module, which dynamically activates a subset of model parameters for each token to reduce computation cost. We implement SPT on PyTorch and customize CUDA kernels to run sparse MHA and routed FFN efficiently. Specifically, we use product quantization to identify the large attention weights and compute attention via sparse matrix multiplication for sparse MHA. For routed FFN, we batch the tokens according to their activated model parameters for efficient computation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SPT on various model configurations. The results show that SPT consistently outperforms well-optimized baselines, reducing the peak memory consumption by up to 50% and accelerating fine-tuning by up to 2.2x.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on kernel-based memory architectures, efficient memory management, and integration strategies, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Kernel-Based Memory Architectures\n\n- **Kernel Memory Networks**: These provide a unified framework for memory modeling, allowing for optimal weight and state update rules. This approach enables kernel-based pattern storage, which can be highly efficient for memory capacity. The framework offers a simple and intuitive way to understand the storage capacity of previous memory models and allows for new biological interpretations.\n\n## Efficient Memory Management\n\n- **Sparse Memory Integration**: Techniques like sparse temporal and cross-series representations, as seen in the \"STanHop: Sparse Tandem Hopfield Model,\" can enhance memory efficiency. This model introduces a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model, which improves memory retrieval error without sacrificing memory capacity.\n  - **Structured Hopfield Networks**: These networks show improved capacity with sparse connections, further optimizing memory usage.\n\n- **Dynamic Context Pruning**: This approach dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. It can reduce context by up to 80% without significant performance degradation and increase inference throughput by 2x.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Efficient Sparse Operations**: Implementing efficient sparse operations is crucial for models that incorporate sparse memory architectures. This involves optimizing the storage and computation of sparse matrices, which can be hardware-aware to leverage the capabilities of modern GPUs and TPUs.\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimization**: Optimizing the model for specific hardware can significantly improve performance. For example, using techniques like mixed-input quantization (e.g., w4a16 quantization) can reduce GPU memory requirements and speed up execution, especially on modern NVIDIA Hopper GPUs.\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Structure**: Implementing a hierarchical memory structure with resolution-specific sparsity can enhance the model's memory efficiency. This involves combining sparse Hopfield networks with dynamic pruning and using kernel-based memory for efficient pattern storage.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n- **Combining Sparse and Kernel-Based Approaches**: Integrating sparse Hopfield networks with kernel-based memory networks can provide a robust and efficient memory architecture. This combination can leverage the strengths of both approaches to optimize memory capacity and computational cost.\n\n- **Dynamic Pruning Integration**: Incorporating dynamic context pruning into the model can further reduce the memory footprint and improve inference throughput. This involves integrating learnable pruning mechanisms that preserve the model's expressiveness while reducing computational requirements.\n\n## Additional Techniques\n\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: While not directly related to kernel-based memory, RAG techniques can enhance the model's performance by providing access to information beyond the training data. This can be particularly useful for knowledge-intensive tasks and can be integrated with the model to improve its overall performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage advanced memory architectures and optimization techniques.\n",

Large Memory Layers with Product Keys (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/21 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nUnfortunately, the fast access to memories rely on an approximate external indexing structure [32] that has to be re-learned periodically. Our work solves this issue by fully incorporating the key selection mechanism as a network component. The transformer network [44] is the current workhorse of Natural Language Processing (NLP): it is employed ubiquitously across a large variety of tasks. Transformers are built by stacking blocks composed of self-attention layers followed by fully connected layers (dubbed FFN), as shown in Figure 3 The components of the memory layer bear similarities to the query, key and value networks used in self-attention layers with two notable differences: the keys and values do not correspond to input tokens but are free embedding vectors, and the number of values (memory size) is very large. ## 3 Learnable product key memories\n\nWe consider the design of a function $m: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that will act as a layer in a neural network. The purpose of $m$ is to offer a large capacity within a neural network. ### 3.1 Memory design\n\nHigh-level structure. The overall structure of our memory is illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 . The memory is composed of three components: a query network, a key selection module containing two sets of sub-keys, and a value lookup table. It first computes a query that is compared to the set of product keys. For each product key, it computes a score and selects the $k$ product keys with the highest scores. The scores are then used to produce an output $m(x)$ via a weighted sum over the values associated with the selected keys. All the parameters of the memory are trainable, yet only $k$ memory slots are updated for each input. The sparse selection and parameter update make both training and inference very efficient. Query generation: pre-processing network. The function $q: x \\mapsto q(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{q}}$, referred to as the query network, maps the $d$-dimensional input to a latent space of dimensionality $d_{\\mathrm{q}}$. Typically, $q$ is a linear mapping or a multi-layer perceptron that reduces the dimensionality from $d$ to $d_{\\mathrm{q}}=$ 512. As keys are randomly initialized, they occupy the space relatively uniformly. Adding a batch normalization layer on the top of the query network helps increasing key coverage during training. This insight is confirmed by our ablation experiments in Section 4.5\n\nStandard key assignment and weighting. Let $q(x)$ be a query and $\\mathcal{T}_{k}$ denote the top-k operator ${ }^{4}$ Given a set of keys $\\mathcal{K}=\\left\\{k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{|\\mathcal{K}|}\\right\\}$ composed of $|\\mathcal{K}| d_{d_{q}}$-dimensional vectors, and an input $x$,\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_cfa6caed5f8792f4a32fg-04.jpg?height=419&width=1271&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=425)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the product keys. We define two discrete subsets of keys (sub-key set 1 and sub-key set 2). They induce a much larger set of keys, which are never made explicit (product keys). Given a query, we split it into two sub-queries ( $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ ). Selecting the $k$ closest keys ( $k=2$ in the figure) in each subset implicitly selects $k \\times k$ keys. The $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query are guaranteed to belong to this subset, on which the search can be done efficiently. we select the top $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query $q(x)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I} & =\\mathcal{T}_{k}\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Get k nearest neighbors } \\\\\nw & =\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right)_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Normalize top-k scores } \\\\\nm(x) & =\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} w_{i} v_{i} & & \\text { \\# Aggregate selected values }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathcal{I}$ denotes the indices of the $k$ most similar keys (where the similarity measure is the inner product), and $w$ is the vector that represents the normalized scores associated with the selected keys.\n```\n\n#### 2. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/21 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2018 international conference on management of data, pp. 489-504, 2018 .

An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) is proposed \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Abstract:** Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 \u2192 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*SHIYANG LI, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** First, convolutional self-attention is proposed by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism, and LogSparse Transformer is proposed, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$ memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1193  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n#### 3. Segmented Recurrent Transformer: An Efficient Sequence-to-Sequence Model\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Yinghan Long, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Kaushik Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** A segmented recurrent transformer that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention that achieves higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown dominant performance across a range of domains including language and vision. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with the sequence length, making their usage prohibitive for resource-constrained applications. To counter this, our approach is to divide the whole sequence into segments and apply attention to the individual segments. We propose a segmented recurrent transformer (SRformer) that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention. The loss caused by reducing the attention window length is compensated by aggregating information across segments with recurrent attention. SRformer leverages Recurrent Accumulate-and-Fire (RAF) neurons' inherent memory to update the cumulative product of keys and values. The segmented attention and lightweight RAF neurons ensure the efficiency of the proposed transformer. Such an approach leads to models with sequential processing capability at a lower computation/memory cost. We apply the proposed method to T5 and BART transformers. The modified models are tested on summarization datasets including CNN-dailymail, XSUM, ArXiv, and MediaSUM. Notably, using segmented inputs of varied sizes, the proposed model achieves $6-22\\%$ higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches. Furthermore, compared to full attention, the proposed model reduces the computational complexity of cross attention by around $40\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

J\u00e9gou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. TeraPool-SDR: An 1.89TOPS 1024 RV-Cores 4MiB Shared-L1 Cluster for Next-Generation Open-Source Software-Defined Radios\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Radio Access Networks (RAN) workloads are rapidly scaling up in data processing intensity and throughput as the 5G (and beyond) standards grow in number of antennas and sub-carriers. Offering flexible Processing Elements (PEs), efficient memory access, and a productive parallel programming model, many-core clusters are a well-matched architecture for next-generation software-defined RANs, but staggering performance requirements demand a high number of PEs coupled with extreme Power, Performance and Area (PPA) efficiency. We present the architecture, design, and full physical implementation of Terapool-SDR, a cluster for Software Defined Radio (SDR) with 1024 latency-tolerant, compact RV32 PEs, sharing a global view of a 4MiB, 4096-banked, L1 memory.

The TeraPool-SDR cluster achieves high energy efficiency on all SDR key kernels for 5G RANs: Fast Fourier Transform (93GOPS/W), Matrix-Multiplication (125GOPS/W), Channel Estimation (96GOPS/W), and Linear System Inversion (61GOPS/W).

Theory, Analysis, and Best Practices for Sigmoid Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Russ Webb, Amitis Shidani, Zijin Gu, Jagrit Digani, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Pierre Ablin, Dan Busbridge, Floris Weers, Eeshan Dhekane, Federico Danieli, Jason Ramapuram*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a key part of the transformer architecture. It is a sequence-to-sequence mapping that transforms each sequence element into a weighted sum of values. The weights are typically obtained as the softmax of dot products between keys and queries. Recent work has explored alternatives to softmax attention in transformers, such as ReLU and sigmoid activations. In this work, we revisit sigmoid attention and conduct an in-depth theoretical and empirical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that transformers with sigmoid attention are universal function approximators and benefit from improved regularity compared to softmax attention. Through detailed empirical analysis, we identify stabilization of large initial attention norms during the early stages of training as a crucial factor for the successful training of models with sigmoid attention, outperforming prior attempts. We also introduce FLASHSIGMOID, a hardware-aware and memory-efficient implementation of sigmoid attention yielding a 17% inference kernel speed-up over FLASHATTENTION2 on H100 GPUs. Experiments across language, vision, and speech show that properly normalized sigmoid attention matches the strong performance of softmax attention on a wide range of domains and scales, which previous attempts at sigmoid attention were unable to fully achieve. Our work unifies prior art and establishes best practices for sigmoid attention as a drop-in softmax replacement in transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. QJL: 1-Bit Quantized JL Transform for KV Cache Quantization with Zero Overhead\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Insu Han, Majid Daliri, Amir Zandieh*\n\n**Abstract:** Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime.

This approach significantly increases the model's capacity with minimal computational overhead. The use of product keys allows for sparse parameter updates, which is efficient and scalable.\n\n## Integration with Transformer Architectures\n- **Kernel Memory Networks**: Integrating kernel-based memory methods with transformer architectures can provide a unified framework for memory modeling. This approach offers optimal weight and state update rules and efficient pattern storage through kernel-based methods. This can enhance the storage capacity and efficiency of the model in the analysis note.\n\n## Sparse Computation and Optimization Techniques\n- **Sparse Parameter Updates**: Using sparse operations for parameter updates in large memory layers can significantly reduce computational overhead. This is particularly beneficial in models that utilize product key memory, as it allows for linear scaling with memory size without substantial computational costs in the analysis note.\n- **Non-Differentiable Memory**: Implementing non-differentiable memory, as seen in \"Memorizing Transformers,\" can improve efficiency by reducing the need for backpropagation through the memory. This approach also enables immediate knowledge acquisition through approximate kNN lookup, which can be scaled up to large memory sizes in the analysis note.\n- **Quantization and Batching**: Techniques such as quantization and continuous batching can further optimize the model's performance. Quantization reduces the model size and improves inference speed without sacrificing accuracy, while batching allows multiple requests to be processed simultaneously, increasing throughput.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Execution\n- **In- and Near-Memory Processing**: Utilizing in- and near-memory processing, as described in the neuromorphic decoder-only transformer model, can significantly reduce peak memory requirements. This approach stores token caches locally, eliminating the need to transfer them to other parts of the chip or retrieve them from external memory. This is particularly beneficial for autoregressive inference, where it avoids the instantiation of a full attention mask.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n- **Optimized Memory Allocation**: Techniques like PagedAttention can optimize memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks, alleviating constraints associated with memory management during inference. Additionally, distributed training and memory-efficient execution plans can help manage memory pressure effectively.\n\nBy combining these insights:\n- **Use product key memory** to enable fast and efficient nearest neighbor searches and sparse parameter updates.\n- **Integrate kernel-based memory methods** to optimize pattern storage and provide a unified framework for memory modeling.\n- **Implement non-differentiable memory** for efficient updates and immediate knowledge acquisition.\n- **Utilize quantization, batching, and optimized memory allocation** to enhance performance and efficiency.\n- **Leverage in- and near-memory processing** to reduce peak memory requirements and improve autoregressive inference.\n\nThese strategies can help in designing an autoregressive language model that is not only efficient in terms of memory usage but also scalable and performant.\n",

This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-ofthe-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets.

For example, linear memory networks use a linear autoencoder for sequences as a memory (Carta et al., 2020). Additional memories for RNNs like holographic reduced representations (Danihelka et al., 2016), tensor product representations (Schlag \\& Schmidhuber, 2018; Schlag et al., 2019) and classical associative memories (extended to fast weight approaches) (Schmidhuber, 1992; Ba et al., 2016a;b; Zhang \\& Zhou, 2017; Schlag et al., 2021) have been suggested. Most approaches to new memories are based on attention. The neural Turing machine (NTM) is equipped with an external memory and an attention process (Graves et al., 2014). Memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) use an arg max attention by first mapping a query and patterns into a space and then retrieving the pattern with the largest dot product. End to end memory networks (EMN) make this attention scheme differentiable by replacing arg max through a softmax (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015a;b). EMN with dot products became very popular and implement a key-value attention (Daniluk et al., 2017) for self-attention. An enhancement of EMN is the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017a;b) and its\nextensions (Dehghani et al., 2018). The transformer has had a great impact on the natural language processing (NLP) community, in particular via the BERT models (Devlin et al., 2018; 2019). Contribution of this work: (i) introducing novel deep learning layers that are equipped with a memory via modern Hopfield networks, (ii) introducing a novel energy function and a novel update rule for continuous modern Hopfield networks that are differentiable and typically retrieve patterns after one update. Differentiability is required for gradient descent parameter updates and retrieval with one update is compatible with activating the layers of deep networks. We suggest using modern Hopfield networks to store information or learned prototypes in different layers of neural networks. Binary Hopfield networks were introduced as associative memories that can store and retrieve patterns (Hopfield, 1982). A query pattern can retrieve the pattern to which it is most similar or an average over similar patterns. Hopfield networks seem to be an ancient technique, however, new energy functions improved their properties. The stability of spurious states or metastable states was sensibly reduced (Barra et al., 2018). The largest and most impactful successes are reported on increasing the storage capacity of Hopfield networks. In a $d$-dimensional space, the standard Hopfield model can store $d$ uncorrelated patterns without errors but only $C d / \\log (d)$ random patterns with $C<1 / 2$ for a fixed stable pattern or $C<1 / 4$ if all patterns are stable (McEliece et al., 1987). The same bound holds for nonlinear learning rules (Mazza, 1997). Using tricks-of-trade and allowing small retrieval errors, the storage capacity is about $0.138 d$ (Crisanti et al., 1986; Hertz et al., 1991; Torres et al., 2002). If the learning rule is not related to the Hebb rule, then up to $d$ patterns can be stored (Abu-Mostafa \\& StJacques, 1985). For Hopfield networks with non-zero diagonal matrices, the storage can be increased to $C d \\log (d)$ (Folli et al., 2017). In contrast to the storage capacity, the number of energy minima (spurious states, stable states) of Hopfield networks is exponential in $d$ (Tanaka \\& Edwards, 1980; Bruck \\& Roychowdhury, 1990; Wainrib \\& Touboul, 2013). The standard binary Hopfield network has an energy function that can be expressed as the sum of interaction functions $F$ with $F(x)=x^{2}$. Modern Hopfield networks, also called \"dense associative memory\" (DAM) models, use an energy function with interaction functions of the form $F(x)=x^{n}$ and, thereby, achieve a storage capacity proportional to $d^{n-1}$ (Krotov \\& Hopfield, 2016; 2018). The energy function of modern Hopfield networks makes them robust against adversarial attacks (Krotov \\& Hopfield, 2018). Modern binary Hopfield networks with energy functions based on interaction functions of the form $F(x)=\\exp (x)$ even lead to storage capacity of $2^{d / 2}$, where all stored binary patterns are fixed points but the radius of attraction vanishes (Demircigil et al., 2017). However, in order to integrate Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, it is necessary to make them differentiable, that is, we require continuous Hopfield networks (Hopfield, 1984; Koiran, 1994). Therefore, we generalize the energy function of Demircigil et al. (2017) that builds on exponential interaction functions to continuous patterns and states and obtain a new modern Hopfield network. We also propose a new update rule which ensures global convergence to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points). We prove that our new modern Hopfield network typically retrieves patterns in one update step ( $\\epsilon$-close to the fixed point) with an exponentially low error and has a storage capacity proportional to $c^{\\frac{d-1}{4}}$ (reasonable settings for $c=1.37$ and $c=3.15$ are given in Theorem 3). The retrieval of patterns with one update is important to integrate Hopfield networks in deep learning architectures, where layers are activated only once. Surprisingly, our new update rule is also the key-value attention as used in transformer and BERT models (see Fig. 1). Our modern Hopfield networks can be integrated as a new layer in deep learning architectures for pooling, memory, prototype learning, and attention. We test these new layers on different benchmark datasets and tasks like immune repertoire classification. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f864a77dbadd9776a90g-02.jpg?height=209&width=1389&top_left_y=2129&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1: We generalize the energy of binary modern Hopfield networks to continuous states while keeping fast convergence and storage capacity properties. We also propose a new update rule that minimizes the energy. The new update rule is the attention mechanism of the transformer. Formulae are modified to express softmax as row vector. \" $=$ \"-sign means \"keeps the properties\". ## 2 Modern Hopfield Nets with Continuous States\n\nNew energy function for continuous state Hopfield networks. In order to integrate modern Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, we have to make them continuous. To allow for continuous states, we propose a new energy function that is a modification of the energy of modern Hopfield networks (Demircigil et al., 2017). We also propose a new update rule which can be proven to converge to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points). We have $N$ stored (key) patterns $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ represented by the matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{N}\\right)$ with the largest pattern $M=\\max _{i}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\|$. The state (query) pattern is $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. For exponential interaction functions, we need the $\\log$-sum-exp function (lse) for $0<\\beta$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{lse}(\\beta, \\boldsymbol{x})=\\beta^{-1} \\log \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\beta x_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is convex (see appendix Eq. (461), and Lemma A22). The energy function E of the modern Hopfield networks for binary patterns $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ and a binary state pattern $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is $\\mathrm{E}=-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} F\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{T} \\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right)$ (Krotov \\& Hopfield, 2016). Here, $F(x)=x^{n}$ is the interaction function, where $n=2$ gives the classical Hopfield network. The storage capacity is proportional to $d^{n-1}$ (Krotov \\& Hopfield, 2016). This model was generalized by Demircigil et al. (2017) to exponential interaction functions $F(x)=$ $\\exp (x)$ which gives the energy $\\mathrm{E}=-\\exp \\left(\\operatorname{lse}\\left(1, \\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right)\\right)$. This energy leads to an exponential storage capacity of $N=2^{d / 2}$ for binary patterns. Furthermore, with a single update, the fixed point is recovered with high probability for random patterns. However, still this modern Hopfield network has binary states. We generalize this energy function to continuous-valued patterns while keeping the properties of the modern Hopfield networks like the exponential storage capacity and the extremely fast convergence (see Fig. 1). For the new energy we take the logarithm of the negative energy of modern Hopfield networks and add a quadratic term of the current state. The quadratic term ensures that the norm of the state vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ remains finite and the energy is bounded. Classical Hopfield networks do not require to bound the norm of their state vector, since it is binary and has fixed length. We define the novel energy function $E$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}=-\\operatorname{lse}\\left(\\beta, \\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}+\\beta^{-1} \\log N+\\frac{1}{2} M^{2}\n$$\n\nWe have $0 \\leqslant \\mathrm{E} \\leqslant 2 M^{2}$ (see appendix Lemma A1). Using $\\boldsymbol{p}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\beta \\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right)$, we define a novel update rule (see Fig. 1):\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{\\text {new }}=f(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\beta \\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe next theorem states that the update rule Eq. (3) converges globally. The proof uses the ConcaveConvex Procedure (CCCP) (Yuille \\& Rangarajan, 2002; 2003), which is equivalent to Legendre minimization (Rangarajan et al., 1996; 1999) algorithms (Yuille \\& Rangarajan, 2003). Theorem 1. The update rule Eq. (3) converges globally: For $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{t+1}=f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{t}\\right)$, the energy $\\mathrm{E}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{t}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathrm{E}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{*}\\right)$ for $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and a fixed point $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{*}$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/145 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n5 in the appendix. Conclusion. We have introduced a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and the corresponding new update rule. This network can store exponentially many patterns, retrieves patterns with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. We analyzed the attention heads of BERT models. The new modern Hopfield networks have been integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. Hopfield layers that equip neural network layers with memories improved state-of-the-art in three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems and on immune repertoire classification, and on two drug design dataset. They yielded the best results among different machine learning methods on the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe ELLIS Unit Linz, the LIT AI Lab and the Institute for Machine Learning are supported by the Land Ober\u00f6sterreich, LIT grants DeepToxGen (LIT-2017-3-YOU-003), and AI-SNN (LIT2018-6-YOU-214), the Medical Cognitive Computing Center (MC3), Janssen Pharmaceutica, UCB Biopharma, Merck Group, Audi.JKU Deep Learning Center, Audi Electronic Venture GmbH, TGW, Primal, S3AI (FFG-872172), Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), Anyline, FILL, EnliteAI, Google Brain, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, T\u00dcV Austria, DCS, and the NVIDIA Corporation.

Static pattern means that the pattern does not depend on the network input, i.e. it is determined by the bias weights and remains constant across different network inputs. Static state patterns allow to determine whether particular fixed patterns are among the stored patterns and vice versa. The static pattern functionality is typically needed if particular patterns must be identified in the data, e.g. as described for immune repertoire classification in the main paper, where a fixed $d_{k}$-dimensional state vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is used. -Pattern Normalization. In the appendix, e.g. in Lemma A7 or in Eq. (102) and Eq. (103), we showed that the characteristics of the fixed points of the new modern Hopfield network are determined by: $\\beta, M$ (maximal pattern norm), $m_{\\max }$ (spread of the similar patterns), and $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right\\|$ (center of the similar patterns). We already discussed the parameter $\\beta$ while the spread of the similar patterns $m_{\\max }$ is given by the data. The remaining variables $M$ and $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ that both control the fixed point dynamics are adjusted pattern normalization. $M$ is the maximal pattern norm and $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ the center of the similar patterns. Theorem A5 says that larger $M$ allows for more patterns to be stored. However, the size of metastable states will decrease with increasing $M$. The vector $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ says how well the (similar) patterns are centered. If the norm $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right\\|$ is large, then this leads to smaller metastable states. The two parameters $M$ and $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ are controlled by pattern normalization and determine the size and convergence properties of metastable states. These two parameters are important for creating large gradients if heads start with global averaging which has small gradient. These two parameters can shift a head towards small metastable states which have largest gradient as shown in Fig. A.5(b). We allow for three different pattern normalizations, where the first is the default setting:\n\n- pattern normalization of the input patterns,\n- pattern normalization after mapping into the associative space,\n- no pattern normalization. ## A.6.3 UsAGE\n\nAs outlined in Sec. A.6.1, there are a variety of possible use cases for the Hopfield layer, e.g. to build memory networks or transformer models. The goal of the implementation is therefore to provide an easy to use Hopfield module that can be used in a wide range of applications, be it as part of a larger architecture or as a standalone module. Consequently, the focus of the Hopfield layer interface is set on its core parameters: the association of two sets, the scaling parameter $\\beta$, the maximum number of updates, the dimension of the associative space, the possible usage of static patterns, and the pattern normalization. The integration into the PyTorch framework is built such that with all the above functionalities disabled, the \"HopfieldEncoderLayer\" and the \"HopfieldDecoderLayer\", both extensions of the Hopfield module, can be used as a one-to-one plug-in replacement for the TransformerEncoderLayer and the TransformerDecoderLayer, respectively, of the PyTorch transformer module. The Hopfield layer can be used to implement or to substitute different layers:\n\n- Pooling layers: We consider the Hopfield layer as a pooling layer if only one static state (query) pattern exists. Then, it is de facto a pooling over the sequence, which results from the softmax values applied on the stored patterns. Therefore, our Hopfield layer can act as a pooling layer. - Permutation equivariant layers: Our Hopfield layer can be used as a plug-in replacement for permutation equivariant layers. Since the Hopfield layer is an associative memory it assumes no dependency between the input patterns. - GRU \\& LSTM layers: Our Hopfield layer can be used as a plug-in replacement for GRU \\& LSTM layers. Optionally, for substituting GRU \\& LSTM layers, positional encoding might be considered. - Attention layers: Our Hopfield layer can act as an attention layer, where state (query) and stored (key) patterns are different, and need to be associated. - Finally, the extensions of the Hopfield layer are able to operate as a self-attention layer (HopfieldEncoderLayer) and as cross-attention layer (HopfieldDecoderLayer), as described in (Vaswani et al., 2017a). As such, it can be used as building block of transformer-based or general architectures. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f864a77dbadd9776a90g-87.jpg?height=1766&width=1143&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=491)\n\nFigure A.7: A flowchart of the Hopfield layer. First, the raw state (query) patterns $\\boldsymbol{R}$ and the raw stored (key) patterns $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ are optionally normalized (with layer normalization), projected and optionally normalized (with layer normalization) again. The default setting is a layer normalization of the input patterns, and no layer normalization of the projected patterns. The raw stored patterns $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ can in principle be also two different input tensors. Optionally, multiple updates take place in the projected space of $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{K}$. This update rule is obtained e.g. from the full update Eq. (423) or the simplified update Eq. (424) in the appendix. ## REFERENCES\n\nY. Abu-Mostafa and J.-M. StJacques. Information capacity of the Hopfield model.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Outlier-Efficient Hopfield Layers for Large Transformer-Based Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer hopfield integration\"*\n\n*Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Pei-Hsuan Chang, Haozheng Luo, Hong-Yu Chen, Weijian Li, Wei-Po Wang, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model is introduced and used to address the outlier inefficiency problem of {training} gigantic transformer-based models and a novel associative memory model facilitating outlier-efficient associative memory retrievals is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce an Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model (termed $\\mathrm{OutEffHop}$) and use it to address the outlier inefficiency problem of {training} gigantic transformer-based models. Our main contribution is a novel associative memory model facilitating \\textit{outlier-efficient} associative memory retrievals. Interestingly, this memory model manifests a model-based interpretation of an outlier-efficient attention mechanism (${\\rm Softmax}_1$): it is an approximation of the memory retrieval process of $\\mathrm{OutEffHop}$. Methodologically, this allows us to introduce novel outlier-efficient Hopfield layers as powerful alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms, with superior post-quantization performance. Theoretically, the Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model retains and improves the desirable properties of standard modern Hopfield models, including fixed point convergence and exponential storage capacity. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model across large-scale transformer-based and Hopfield-based models (including BERT, OPT, ViT, and STanHop-Net), benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods like $\\mathtt{Clipped\\_Softmax}$ and $\\mathtt{Gated\\_Attention}$. Notably, $\\mathrm{OutEffHop}$ achieves an average reduction of 22+\\% in average kurtosis and 26+\\% in the maximum infinity norm of model outputs across four models.

Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer hopfield integration\"*\n\n*Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, A. Farimani, Chandan K. Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fitting-complexity trade-off, extrapolation abilities, and robustness to noise.\n\n**Abstract:** Symbolic regression (SR) is a challenging task in machine learning that involves finding a mathematical expression for a function based on its values. Recent advancements in SR have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-trained transformer-based models in generating equations as sequences, leveraging large-scale pre-training on synthetic datasets and offering notable advantages in terms of inference time over classical Genetic Programming (GP) methods. However, these models primarily rely on supervised pre-training goals borrowed from text generation and overlook equation discovery objectives like accuracy and complexity. To address this, we propose TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process. Unlike conventional decoding strategies, TPSR enables the integration of non-differentiable feedback, such as fitting accuracy and complexity, as external sources of knowledge into the transformer-based equation generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the model's fitting-complexity trade-off, extrapolation abilities, and robustness to noise.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. The Cost of Compression: Investigating the Impact of Compression on Parametric Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression benchmarks\"*\n\n*Satya Sai, Srinath Namburi, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Srinath Srinivasan, Frederic Sala*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive analysis across multiple model families using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance, with a particular focus on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing large language models (LLMs), often consisting of billions of parameters, provides faster inference, smaller memory footprints, and enables local deployment. Two standard compression techniques are pruning and quantization, with the former eliminating redundant connections in model layers and the latter representing model parameters with fewer bits. The key tradeoff is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER, ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical insights to help make informed decisions on compression.

Leaner and Faster: Two-Stage Model Compression for Lightweight Text-Image Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression benchmarks\"*\n\n*Siyu Ren, Kenny Q. Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents an effective two-stage framework to compress large pre-trained dual-encoder for lightweight text-image retrieval, which is smaller, faster, and better than the original full model on Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Current text-image approaches (e.g., CLIP) typically adopt dual-encoder architecture using pre-trained vision-language representation. However, these models still pose non-trivial memory requirements and substantial incremental indexing time, which makes them less practical on mobile devices. In this paper, we present an effective two-stage framework to compress large pre-trained dual-encoder for lightweight text-image retrieval. The resulting model is smaller (39% of the original), faster (1.6x/2.9x for processing image/text respectively), yet performs on par with or better than the original full model on Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks. We also open-source an accompanying realistic mobile image search application.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Distilling Linguistic Context for Language Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression benchmarks\"*\n\n*Geondo Park, Gyeongman Kim, Eunho Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a new knowledge distillation objective for language representation learning that transfers the contextual knowledge via two types of relationships across representations: Word Relation and Layer Transforming Relation.\n\n**Abstract:** A computationally expensive and memory intensive neural network lies behind the recent success of language representation learning. Knowledge distillation, a major technique for deploying such a vast language model in resource-scarce environments, transfers the knowledge on individual word representations learned without restrictions. In this paper, inspired by the recent observations that language representations are relatively positioned and have more semantic knowledge as a whole, we present a new knowledge distillation objective for language representation learning that transfers the contextual knowledge via two types of relationships across representations: Word Relation and Layer Transforming Relation. Unlike other recent distillation techniques for the language models, our contextual distillation does not have any restrictions on architectural changes between teacher and student. We validate the effectiveness of our method on challenging benchmarks of language understanding tasks, not only in architectures of various sizes but also in combination with DynaBERT, the recently proposed adaptive size pruning method.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. Self-paced Contrastive Learning with Hybrid Memory for Domain Adaptive Object Re-ID\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory stability\"*\n\n*Yixiao Ge, Dapeng Chen, Feng Zhu, Rui Zhao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel self-paced contrastive learning framework with hybrid memory that outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple domain adaptation tasks of object re-ID and even boosts the performance on the source domain without any extra annotations.\n\n**Abstract:** Domain adaptive object re-ID aims to transfer the learned knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain to tackle the open-class re-identification problems. Although state-of-the-art pseudo-label-based methods have achieved great success, they did not make full use of all valuable information because of the domain gap and unsatisfying clustering performance. To solve these problems, we propose a novel self-paced contrastive learning framework with hybrid memory. The hybrid memory dynamically generates source-domain class-level, target-domain cluster-level and un-clustered instance-level supervisory signals for learning feature representations. Different from the conventional contrastive learning strategy, the proposed framework jointly distinguishes source-domain classes, and target-domain clusters and un-clustered instances. Most importantly, the proposed self-paced method gradually creates more reliable clusters to refine the hybrid memory and learning targets, and is shown to be the key to our outstanding performance. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple domain adaptation tasks of object re-ID and even boosts the performance on the source domain without any extra annotations. Our generalized version on unsupervised person re-ID surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by considerable 16.2% and 14.6% on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID benchmarks.

Pre-computed memory or on-the-fly encoding? A hybrid approach to retrieval augmentation makes the most of your compute\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory stability\"*\n\n*Michiel de Jong, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Nicholas FitzGerald, J. Ainslie, Sumit K. Sanghai, Fei Sha, W. Cohen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task.\n\n**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented language models such as Fusion-in-Decoder are powerful, setting the state of the art on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks. However, they are also expensive, due to the need to encode a large number of retrieved passages. Some work avoids this cost by pre-encoding a text corpus into a memory and retrieving dense representations directly. However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input. We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute budget. Moreover, the advantage of LUMEN over FiD increases with model size.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Hopfield Networks is All You Need\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer hopfield integration\"*\n\n*Hubert Ramsauer, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl, Johannes Lehner, Philipp Seidl, Michael Widrich, Thomas Adler, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Milena Pavlovi\u0107, Geir Kjetil Sandve, Victor Greiff, David Kreil, Michael Kopp, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a\ncorresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially\n(with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the\npattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has\nthree types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed\npoint averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a\nsubset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new\nupdate rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This\nequivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models.\nThese heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in\nhigher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield\nnetwork can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow\nthe storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned\nprototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond\nfully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling,\nmemory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad\napplicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers\nimproved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance\nlearning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several\nhundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small\nclassification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield\nlayers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine\nlearning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two\ndrug design datasets.

Tree Attention: Topology-aware Decoding for Long-Context Attention on\n  GPU clusters\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer hopfield integration\"*\n\n*Vasudev Shyam, Jonathan Pilault, Emily Shepperd, Quentin Anthony, Beren Millidge*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer\narchitectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its\nquadratic complexity in the sequence length. In this work, we derive the scalar\nenergy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus\nelucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a\nBayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with\nenergy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the\nreduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel\nthrough a tree reduction. Our algorithm, for parallelizing attention\ncomputation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed\nasymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than alternative\napproaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less\ncommunication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory.

Compress, Then Prompt: Improving Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off of LLM\n  Inference with Transferable Prompt\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression benchmarks\"*\n\n*Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Beidi Chen, Yuxin Tang, Jue Wang, Kaixiong Zhou, Xia Hu, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**Abstract:** While the numerous parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute to\ntheir superior performance, this massive scale makes them inefficient and\nmemory-hungry. Thus, they are hard to deploy on commodity hardware, such as one\nsingle GPU. Given the memory and power constraints of such devices, model\ncompression methods are widely employed to reduce both the model size and\ninference latency, which essentially trades off model quality in return for\nimproved efficiency. Thus, optimizing this accuracy-efficiency trade-off is\ncrucial for the LLM deployment on commodity hardware. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new perspective to optimize this trade-off by prompting compressed\nmodels. Specifically, we first observe that for certain questions, the\ngeneration quality of a compressed LLM can be significantly improved by adding\ncarefully designed hard prompts, though this isn't the case for all questions.\nBased on this observation, we propose a soft prompt learning method where we\nexpose the compressed model to the prompt learning process, aiming to enhance\nthe performance of prompts. Our experimental analysis suggests our soft prompt\nstrategy greatly improves the performance of the 8x compressed LLaMA-7B model\n(with a joint 4-bit quantization and 50% weight pruning compression), allowing\nthem to match their uncompressed counterparts on popular benchmarks. Also, we\ndemonstrate that these learned prompts can be transferred across various\ndatasets, tasks, and compression levels. Hence with this transferability, we\ncan stitch the soft prompt to a newly compressed model to improve the test-time\naccuracy in an ``in-situ'' way.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-17T20:45:13Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-10T04:01:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Compressing LLMs: The Truth is Rarely Pure and Never Simple\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression benchmarks\"*\n\n*Ajay Jaiswal, Zhe Gan, Xianzhi Du, Bowen Zhang, Zhangyang Wang, Yinfei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievements, modern Large Language Models (LLMs)\nface exorbitant computational and memory footprints. Recently, several works\nhave shown significant success in training-free and data-free compression\n(pruning and quantization) of LLMs that achieve 50 - 60% sparsity and reduce\nthe bit width to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible degradation of\nperplexity over the uncompressed baseline. As recent research efforts are\nfocused on developing increasingly sophisticated compression methods, our work\ntakes a step back and re-evaluates the effectiveness of existing SoTA\ncompression methods, which rely on a fairly simple and widely questioned\nmetric, perplexity (even for dense LLMs). We introduce Knowledge-Intensive\nCompressed LLM BenchmarK (LLM-KICK), a collection of carefully curated tasks to\nredefine the evaluation protocol for compressed LLMs, which have significant\nalignment with their dense counterparts and perplexity fail to capture subtle\nchange in their true capabilities. LLM-KICK unveils many favorable merits and\nunfortunate plights of current SoTA compression methods: all pruning methods\nsuffer significant performance degradation, sometimes at trivial sparsity\nratios (e.g., 25-30%), and fail for N:M sparsity in knowledge-intensive tasks;\ncurrent quantization methods are more successful than pruning; yet, pruned LLMs\neven at $\\geq 50$% sparsity are robust in-context retrieval and summarization\nsystems; among others. LLM-KICK is designed to holistically access compressed\nLLMs' ability for language understanding, reasoning, generation, in-context\nretrieval, in-context summarization, etc. We hope our study can foster the\ndevelopment of better LLM compression methods.

Learning to Summarize Long Texts with Memory Compression and Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory stability\"*\n\n*Jaehong Park, Jonathan Pilault, Christopher Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mem2Mem, a memory-to-memory mechanism for hierarchical recurrent\nneural network based encoder decoder architectures and we explore its use for\nabstractive document summarization. Mem2Mem transfers \"memories\" via\nreadable/writable external memory modules that augment both the encoder and\ndecoder. Our memory regularization compresses an encoded input article into a\nmore compact set of sentence representations. Most importantly, the memory\ncompression step performs implicit extraction without labels, sidestepping\nissues with suboptimal ground-truth data and exposure bias of hybrid\nextractive-abstractive summarization techniques. By allowing the decoder to\nread/write over the encoded input memory, the model learns to read salient\ninformation about the input article while keeping track of what has been\ngenerated. Our Mem2Mem approach yields results that are competitive with state\nof the art transformer based summarization methods, but with 16 times fewer\nparameters\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory stability\"*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning\nand further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with\nAdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the\nhardware barrier to training large language models.

Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer hopfield integration\"*\n\n*G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Sepp Hochreiter, Markus Holzleitner, Milena Pavlovi\u0107, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl, Victor Greiff, Michael Widrich, Johannes Brandstetter, Hubert Ramsauer, Lukas Gruber, Geir Kjetil Sandve*\n\n**Abstract:** A central mechanism in machine learning is to identify, store, and recognize patterns. How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial in Hopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show that the attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the update rule of modern Hopfield networks that can store exponentially many patterns. We exploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve a challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology: immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learning methods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines and therapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by the COVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number of immunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedly massive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currently considered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, we present our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, or equivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures for massive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate that DeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance on large-scale experiments, including simulated and real-world virus infection data, and enables the extraction of sequence motifs that are connected to a given disease class.

In\nthis paper, we revisit these approaches by considering, additionally, the\nmemory constraint required to index billions of images on a single server.

We encode the indexed vectors using quantization and exploit\nthe graph structure to refine the similarity estimation.\n  In essence, our method takes the best of these two worlds: the search\nstrategy is based on nested graphs, thereby providing high precision with a\nrelatively small set of comparisons. At the same time it offers a significant\nmemory compression.

Sampling Hybrid Climate Simulation at Scale to Reliably Improve Machine Learning Parameterization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory stability\"*\n\n*Mike Pritchard, Margarita Geleta, Zeyuan Hu, Eliot Wong-Toi, Tom Beucler, Liran Peng, Pierre Gentine, Sungduk Yu, Jerry Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine-learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid processes (here of turbulence, convection, and radiation) may one day replace conventional parameterizations by emulating high-resolution physics without the cost of explicit simulation. However, their development has been stymied by uncertainty surrounding whether or not improved offline performance translates to improved online performance (i.e., when coupled to a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)). A key barrier has been the limited sampling of the online effects of the ML design decisions and tuning due to the complexity of performing large ensembles of hybrid physics-ML climate simulations. Our work examines the coupled behavior of full-physics ML parameterizations using large ensembles of hybrid simulations, totalling 2,970 in our case. With extensive sampling, we statistically confirm that lowering offline error lowers online error (given certain constraints). However, we also reveal that decisions decreasing online error, like removing dropout, can trade off against hybrid model stability and vice versa. Nevertheless, we are able to identify design decisions that yield unambiguous improvements to offline and online performance, namely incorporating memory and training on multiple climates. We also find that converting moisture input from specific to relative humidity enhances online stability and that using a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss breaks the aforementioned offline/online error relationship. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we empirically answer previously unresolved questions regarding subgrid ML parameterization design.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating Hopfield networks with transformers, optimizing memory compression, and ensuring training stability in hybrid systems, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Integration of Hopfield Networks with Transformers\n\n### Architectural Designs\n- Modern Hopfield networks have been shown to be more practical when integrated with transformer attention mechanisms. This integration can enhance the memory efficiency and pattern storage capabilities of the model. For instance, the connection between Hopfield networks and transformers allows for the exploitation of the exponential storage capacity of Hopfield networks, which can be particularly useful in language models that require efficient memory usage.\n- The architectural design involves using Hopfield layers within the transformer framework to leverage the collective emergence and robustness properties of Hopfield networks. This can be seen in approaches like \"outlier-efficient hopfield layers\" for large transformer-based models, which aim to reduce the computational complexity associated with self-attention mechanisms.\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n- The integration of Hopfield networks with transformers can lead to improved performance in terms of memory efficiency and pattern retrieval. Hopfield networks can store exponentially many patterns with one-step convergence, which is beneficial for tasks requiring rapid retrieval of stored information.\n- The use of Hopfield layers can also enhance the robustness of the model to changes in details, similar to how Hopfield networks are robust to neuron damage, which can improve the overall stability and performance of the hybrid model.\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n- Implementation strategies involve layer-wise training similar to autoencoders, where each layer is trained to preserve some of the original data properties. This can be followed by end-to-end training to fine-tune the model for specific tasks. The probabilistic nature of the neural layer outputs may require alternative optimization methods, such as those used in Boltzmann machines.\n\n## Memory Compression Benchmarks\n\n### Comparative Studies\n- Studies have shown that dynamic compression strategies, such as those used in \"BitStack,\" outperform static approaches in terms of memory usage and model performance. These strategies enable fine-grained control over memory usage and can achieve significant memory savings (50-90%) while maintaining performance[Analysis Note].\n\n### Performance Metrics\n- Key performance metrics include memory usage, model performance (e.g., perplexity, accuracy), and the trade-offs between these two. Metrics such as retrieval error and memory capacity are also crucial when evaluating the effectiveness of memory compression techniques in hybrid models[Analysis Note].\n\n### Real-World Applications\n- In real-world applications, such as language modeling and machine translation, efficient memory compression is essential for deploying large models. Techniques like \"STanHop\" and \"Compressed Context Memory\" have been proposed to enhance memory efficiency in these scenarios, showing promising results in maintaining performance while reducing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n## Training Stability in Hybrid Systems\n\n### Convergence Analysis\n- Convergence analysis is critical in hybrid systems, as the integration of different architectures can introduce new challenges. The one-step convergence property of Hopfield networks can be beneficial, but careful management of training dynamics is necessary to ensure stable convergence. Studies on \"Hopfield Networks is All You Need\" and \"STanHop\" provide insights into how these networks can be designed to ensure stable convergence.\n\n### Error Bounds\n- Error bounds are important for understanding the robustness and stability of the hybrid model. Research on Hopfield networks has shown that they can achieve exponentially small retrieval errors, which is a positive indicator for their integration into larger models.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n- Practical considerations include the optimization of memory access patterns, efficient memory access, and the scaling properties of the model. The use of ReLU attention, for example, can facilitate scalability and reduce the running time of attention computation by bypassing non-contributory elements.\n- Training dynamics need careful management, including tweaks to weight initialization, activation functions, and optimization methods to ensure that the hybrid model trains efficiently and effectively.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of both Hopfield networks and transformer architectures.\n",

This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns.

We have introduced a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and the corresponding new update rule. This network can store exponentially many patterns, retrieves patterns with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. We analyzed the attention heads of BERT models. The new modern Hopfield networks have been integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. Hopfield layers that equip neural network layers with memories improved state-of-the-art in three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems and on immune repertoire classification, and on two drug design dataset. They yielded the best results among different machine learning methods on the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe ELLIS Unit Linz, the LIT AI Lab and the Institute for Machine Learning are supported by the Land Ober\u00f6sterreich, LIT grants DeepToxGen (LIT-2017-3-YOU-003), and AI-SNN (LIT2018-6-YOU-214), the Medical Cognitive Computing Center (MC3), Janssen Pharmaceutica, UCB Biopharma, Merck Group, Audi.JKU Deep Learning Center, Audi Electronic Venture GmbH, TGW, Primal, S3AI (FFG-872172), Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), Anyline, FILL, EnliteAI, Google Brain, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, T\u00dcV Austria, DCS, and the NVIDIA Corporation.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n#### 4. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.30)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Out-of-Distribution Detection based on In-Distribution Data Patterns Memorization with Modern Hopfield Energy\n\n*From Search Query: \"modern hopfield networks language models\"*\n\n*Jinsong Zhang, Qiang Fu, Xu Chen, Lun Du, Zelin Li, Gang Wang, X. Liu, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simplified version of SHE, which utilizes only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class, has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks. OOD detection is challenging since DNN models may produce very high logits value even for OOD samples. Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate OOD data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the OOD sample with Hopfield energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution (ID) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern Hopfield Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version SHE with theoretical analysis. In SHE, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. SHE has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used OOD datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.

Universal Hopfield Networks: A General Framework for Single-Shot Associative Memory Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"modern hopfield networks language models\"*\n\n*Beren Millidge, Tommaso Salvatori, Yuhang Song, Thomas Lukasiewicz, R. Bogacz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper extends the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derives a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics.\n\n**Abstract:** A large number of neural network models of associative memory have been proposed in the literature. These include the classical Hopfield networks (HNs), sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern continuous Hopfield networks (MCHNs), which possess close links with self-attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a general framework for understanding the operation of such memory networks as a sequence of three operations: similarity, separation, and projection. We derive all these memory models as instances of our general framework with differing similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derive a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics. Finally, using our framework, we empirically investigate the capacity of using different similarity functions for these associative memory models, beyond the dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically that Euclidean or Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better in practice on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity than existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code.

KDEformer: Accelerating Transformers via Kernel Density Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: \"product key memory transformers\"*\n\n*A. Zandieh, Insu Han, Majid Daliri, Amin Karbasi*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds, and outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models.\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention mechanism plays a crucial role in modern deep architectures (e.g., Transformer) for sequence modeling, however, na\\\"ive exact computation of this model incurs quadratic time and memory complexities in sequence length, hindering the training of long-sequence models. Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models. On BigGAN image generation, we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over $4\\times$ speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over $18\\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than $0.5\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Approximating Two-Layer Feedforward Networks for Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"product key memory transformers\"*\n\n*R'obert Csord'as, Kazuki Irie, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces several novel perspectives on MoEs, presenting a general framework that unifies various methods to approximate two-layer NNs, including product-key memories (PKMs), and proposes methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs.\n\n**Abstract:** How to reduce compute and memory requirements of neural networks (NNs) without sacrificing performance? Many recent works use sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) to build resource-efficient large language models (LMs). Here we introduce several novel perspectives on MoEs, presenting a general framework that unifies various methods to approximate two-layer NNs (e.g., feedforward blocks of Transformers), including product-key memories (PKMs). Leveraging insights from this framework, we propose methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs. Unlike prior work that compares MoEs with dense baselines under the compute-equal condition, our evaluation condition is parameter-equal, which is crucial to properly evaluate LMs. We show that our MoEs are competitive with the dense Transformer-XL on both the WikiText-103 and enwiki8 datasets at two different scales, while being much more resource efficient. This demonstrates that MoEs are relevant not only to extremely large LMs but also to any-scale resource-efficient LMs. Our code is public.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Lillicrap*\n\n**TL;DR:** The ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples is demonstrated.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite recent breakthroughs in the applications of deep neural networks, one setting that presents a persistent challenge is that of \"one-shot learning.\" Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples.

Lillicrap*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents an end-to-end differentiable memory access scheme, which they call Sparse Access Memory (SAM), that retains the representational power of the original approaches whilst training efficiently with very large memories, and achieves asymptotic lower bounds in space and time complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks augmented with external memory have the ability to learn algorithmic solutions to complex tasks. These models appear promising for applications such as language modeling and machine translation. However, they scale poorly in both space and time as the amount of memory grows \u2014 limiting their applicability to real-world domains. Here, we present an end-to-end differentiable memory access scheme, which we call Sparse Access Memory (SAM), that retains the representational power of the original approaches whilst training efficiently with very large memories. We show that SAM achieves asymptotic lower bounds in space and time complexity, and find that an implementation runs 1,000 x faster and with 3,000x less physical memory than non-sparse models. SAM learns with comparable data efficiency to existing models on a range of synthetic tasks and one-shot Omniglot character recognition, and can scale to tasks requiring 100,000s of time steps and memories. As well, we show how our approach can be adapted for models that maintain temporal associations between memories, as with the recently introduced Differentiable Neural Computer.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 156  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 8.

The new Hopfield network can store exponentially\n(with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the\npattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has\nthree types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed\npoint averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a\nsubset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new\nupdate rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This\nequivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models.\nThese heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in\nhigher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield\nnetwork can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow\nthe storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned\nprototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond\nfully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling,\nmemory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad\napplicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers\nimproved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance\nlearning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several\nhundreds of thousands of instances.

Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"product key memory transformers\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

CLOOB: Modern Hopfield Networks with InfoLOOB Outperform CLIP\n\n*From Search Query: \"modern hopfield networks language models\"*\n\n*Johannes Lehner, Sepp Hochreiter, Angela Bitto-Nemling, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Michael Kopp, David Kreil, Fei Tang, Hubert Ramsauer, Viet Tran, Elisabeth Rumetshofer, Andreas F\u00fcrst*\n\n**Abstract:** CLIP yielded impressive results on zero-shot transfer learning tasks and is considered as a foundation model like BERT or GPT3. CLIP vision models that have a rich representation are pre-trained using the InfoNCE objective and natural language supervision before they are fine-tuned on particular tasks. Though CLIP excels at zero-shot transfer learning, it suffers from an explaining away problem, that is, it focuses on one or few features, while neglecting other relevant features. This problem is caused by insufficiently extracting the covariance structure in the original multi-modal data. We suggest to use modern Hopfield networks to tackle the problem of explaining away. Their retrieved embeddings have an enriched covariance structure derived from co-occurrences of features in the stored embeddings. However, modern Hopfield networks increase the saturation effect of the InfoNCE objective which hampers learning. We propose to use the InfoLOOB objective to mitigate this saturation effect. We introduce the novel \"Contrastive Leave One Out Boost\" (CLOOB), which uses modern Hopfield networks for covariance enrichment together with the InfoLOOB objective. In experiments we compare CLOOB to CLIP after pre-training on the Conceptual Captions and the YFCC dataset with respect to their zero-shot transfer learning performance on other datasets. CLOOB consistently outperforms CLIP at zero-shot transfer learning across all considered architectures and datasets.\n\n**Conference:** cloob-modern-hopfield-networks-with-infoloob\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hopular: Modern Hopfield Networks for Tabular Data\n\n*From Search Query: \"modern hopfield networks language models\"*\n\n*Sepp Hochreiter, Angela Bitto-Nemling, Lukas Gruber, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl*\n\n**Abstract:** While Deep Learning excels in structured data as encountered in vision and natural language processing, it failed to meet its expectations on tabular data. For tabular data, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are the best performing techniques with Gradient Boosting in the lead. Recently, we saw a surge of Deep Learning methods that were tailored to tabular data but still underperform compared to Gradient Boosting on small-sized datasets. We suggest \"Hopular\", a novel Deep Learning architecture for medium- and small-sized datasets, where each layer is equipped with continuous modern Hopfield networks. The modern Hopfield networks use stored data to identify feature-feature, feature-target, and sample-sample dependencies. Hopular's novelty is that every layer can directly access the original input as well as the whole training set via stored data in the Hopfield networks. Therefore, Hopular can step-wise update its current model and the resulting prediction at every layer like standard iterative learning algorithms. In experiments on small-sized tabular datasets with less than 1,000 samples, Hopular surpasses Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, SVMs, and in particular several Deep Learning methods. In experiments on medium-sized tabular data with about 10,000 samples, Hopular outperforms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM and a state-of-the art Deep Learning method designed for tabular data. Thus, Hopular is a strong alternative to these methods on tabular data.\n\n**Conference:** hopular-modern-hopfield-networks-for-tabular\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

However, a typical Transformer model computes such pairwise attention scores repeatedly for the same sequence, in multiple heads in multiple layers. We systematically analyze the empirical similarity of these scores across heads and layers and find them to be considerably redundant, especially adjacent layers showing high similarity. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel architecture that reuses attention scores computed in one layer in multiple subsequent layers. Experiments on a number of standard benchmarks show that reusing attention delivers performance equivalent to or better than standard transformers, while reducing both compute and memory usage.\n\n**Conference:** leveraging-redundancy-in-attention-with-reuse\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-13\n\n\n\n#### 4.

A paper titled \"Hopfield Networks is All You Need\" suggests that Hopfield networks can be used as a drop-in replacement for certain components in neural networks, including those used in language models. This work highlights the exponential storage capacity of Hopfield networks, which could be beneficial for language models needing to store and retrieve large amounts of contextual information.\n- The integration of Hopfield networks into transformer architectures could leverage their associative memory properties to improve the retrieval efficiency of contextual information. For instance, Hopfield networks can recover complete patterns from partial or noisy inputs, which is useful in natural language processing where inputs may be incomplete or corrupted.\n\n### Storage Capacity and Retrieval Efficiency\n- The storage capacity of Hopfield networks is a critical aspect. Research indicates that these networks can store a large number of patterns, but the retrieval efficiency depends on the symmetry of the weights and the energy function. Symmetric weights ensure that the energy function decreases monotonically, which is crucial for efficient retrieval.\n- In practice, the exponential storage capacity claim needs to be validated through experiments. Studies should focus on how well these networks perform in real-world language model scenarios, such as long-range dependency tasks and contextual understanding.\n\n## Product Key Memory Mechanisms\n\n### Implementation Details and Performance Characteristics\n- Product key memory mechanisms are designed to improve the efficiency of memory access in neural networks. These mechanisms typically involve hashing or other indexing techniques to quickly locate and retrieve relevant information.\n- For language models, product key memory could be implemented to enhance the attention mechanism, allowing the model to quickly access relevant contextual information. However, specific implementation details and performance characteristics would need to be studied in the context of language models.\n- A comparison with other memory mechanisms, such as those used in transformer models (e.g., self-attention), would be necessary to understand the scalability and efficiency benefits of product key memory.\n\n### Scaling Properties\n- The scalability of product key memory is crucial for large language models. Research should focus on how these mechanisms scale with the size of the model and the amount of data. This includes studying the computational overhead and memory efficiency as the model grows.\n\n## Memory-Augmented Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Hybrid Architectures and Efficiency Improvements\n- Hybrid architectures combining different memory types, such as Hopfield networks and product key memory, could offer significant improvements in efficiency and performance. For example, using Hopfield networks for associative memory and product key memory for quick access could create a robust and efficient memory system.\n- Studies on the computational costs of these combined approaches are essential. This includes analyzing how the interaction between different memory mechanisms affects training stability and overall model performance.\n- Efficiency improvements could be achieved by optimizing the memory-attention combinations. For instance, using Hopfield networks to store long-term contextual information and product key memory for short-term, rapid access could enhance the model's ability to handle complex tasks efficiently.\n\n### Storage-Computation Trade-offs\n- Investigating the trade-offs between storage capacity and computational efficiency is critical. For example, while Hopfield networks offer high storage capacity, they may introduce additional computational overhead. Product key memory, on the other hand, might be more efficient in terms of computation but could have limitations in storage capacity.\n- Research should aim to balance these trade-offs to achieve optimal performance in language models. This could involve optimizing the architecture to minimize computational costs while maximizing storage efficiency.\n\n## Investigation Plan and Next Steps\n\n### Phase 1: Modern Hopfield Networks\n- Search for recent papers and implementations that integrate Hopfield networks into language models. Analyze their performance characteristics, especially in tasks requiring long-range dependencies and contextual understanding.\n- Investigate the practical implications of the exponential storage capacity claim in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Phase 2: Product Key Memory\n- Research existing implementations of product key memory in neural networks and their performance characteristics. Study how these mechanisms scale with model size and data volume.\n- Compare product key memory with other memory mechanisms used in language models to understand its unique benefits and limitations.\n\n### Phase 3: Integration Approaches\n- Look for similar hybrid architectures that combine different memory types. Analyze the computational efficiency and memory-attention combinations in these architectures.\n- Study the interaction between Hopfield networks and product key memory to understand how they can be integrated effectively. This includes examining the training stability and overall performance of the combined approach.\n\nBy following this investigation plan, researchers can gather the necessary information to design and implement an improved autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of modern Hopfield networks, product key memory, and memory-augmented attention mechanisms.\n",

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/21 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.10997, 2023.

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer. We open-source our model for reproducibility purposes in Jax.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/21 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00172. Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba. 2015.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/51 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415, 2016.

Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a non-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product attention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling with sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/11 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nCurran Associates Inc.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Cutting Off the Head Ends the Conflict: A Mechanism for Interpreting and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Hongbang Yuan, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without updating model parameters and conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization of the method.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, retrieval augmentation and tool augmentation have demonstrated a remarkable capability to expand the internal memory boundaries of language models (LMs) by providing external context. However, internal memory and external context inevitably clash, leading to knowledge conflicts within LMs. In this paper, we aim to interpret the mechanism of knowledge conflicts through the lens of information flow, and then mitigate conflicts by precise interventions at the pivotal point. We find there are some attention heads with opposite effects in the later layers, where memory heads can recall knowledge from internal memory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from external context. Moreover, we reveal that the pivotal point at which knowledge conflicts emerge in LMs is the integration of inconsistent information flows by memory heads and context heads. Inspired by the insights, we propose a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without updating model parameters. PH3 can flexibly control eight LMs to use internal memory ($\\uparrow$ 44.0%) or external context ($\\uparrow$ 38.5%). Moreover, PH3 can also improve the performance of LMs on open-domain QA tasks. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization of our method.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward\"drop-in\"integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. When Do Transformers Shine in RL? Decoupling Memory from Credit Assignment\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Tianwei Ni, Michel Ma, Benjamin Eysenbach, Pierre-Luc Bacon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago, however, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face two distinct challenges: learning effective representations of past and present observations, and determining how actions influence future returns. Both challenges involve modeling long-term dependencies. The Transformer architecture has been very successful to solve problems that involve long-term dependencies, including in the RL domain. However, the underlying reason for the strong performance of Transformer-based RL methods remains unclear: is it because they learn effective memory, or because they perform effective credit assignment? After introducing formal definitions of memory length and credit assignment length, we design simple configurable tasks to measure these distinct quantities. Our empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago. However, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment. In summary, our results provide an explanation for the success of Transformers in RL, while also highlighting an important area for future research and benchmark design.

Think Before You Act: Decision Transformers with Working Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Jikun Kang, Romain Laroche, Xingdi Yuan, Adam Trischler, Xuefei Liu, Jie Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks, and it is demonstrated that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the proposed architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** Decision Transformer-based decision-making agents have shown the ability to generalize across multiple tasks. However, their performance relies on massive data and computation. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the forgetting phenomenon, in which a model memorizes its behaviors in parameters throughout training. As a result, training on a new task may deteriorate the model's performance on previous tasks. In contrast to LLMs' implicit memory mechanism, the human brain utilizes distributed memory storage, which helps manage and organize multiple skills efficiently, mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose a working memory module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the proposed architecture.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Herrmann, Maximilian Granz, Tim Landgraf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The theoretical connection between the curvature of the loss landscape and chaotic dynamics in neural network training is exploited to propose a modified SGD ensuring non-chaotic training dynamics to study the importance thereof in NN training and empirical evidence suggesting that the negative eigenspectrum cannot be removed from SGD without hurting training performance is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** With the advent of deep learning over the last decade, a considerable amount of effort has gone into better understanding and enhancing Stochastic Gradient Descent so as to improve the performance and stability of artificial neural network training. Active research fields in this area include exploiting second order information of the loss landscape and improving the understanding of chaotic dynamics in optimization. This paper exploits the theoretical connection between the curvature of the loss landscape and chaotic dynamics in neural network training to propose a modified SGD ensuring non-chaotic training dynamics to study the importance thereof in NN training. Building on this, we present empirical evidence suggesting that the negative eigenspectrum - and thus directions of local chaos - cannot be removed from SGD without hurting training performance. Extending our empirical analysis to long-term chaos dynamics, we challenge the widespread understanding of convergence against a confined region in parameter space. Our results show that although chaotic network behavior is mostly confined to the initial training phase, models perturbed upon initialization do diverge at a slow pace even after reaching top training performance, and that their divergence can be modelled through a composition of a random walk and a linear divergence. The tools and insights developed as part of our work contribute to improving the understanding of neural network training dynamics and provide a basis for future improvements of optimization methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Out-of-Distribution Detection based on In-Distribution Data Patterns Memorization with Modern Hopfield Energy\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network training stability\"*\n\n*Jinsong Zhang, Qiang Fu, Xu Chen, Lun Du, Zelin Li, Gang Wang, X. Liu, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simplified version of SHE, which utilizes only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class, has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks. OOD detection is challenging since DNN models may produce very high logits value even for OOD samples. Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate OOD data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the OOD sample with Hopfield energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution (ID) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern Hopfield Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version SHE with theoretical analysis. In SHE, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. SHE has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used OOD datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.

Is L2 Physics-Informed Loss Always Suitable for Training Physics-Informed Neural Network?\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network training stability\"*\n\n*Chuwei Wang, Shanda Li, Di He, Liwei Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel PINN training algorithm is developed to minimize the $L^{\\infty$ loss for HJB equations which is in a similar spirit to adversarial training and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically demonstrated through experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach is a new and promising way to solve partial differential equations using deep learning. The $L^2$ Physics-Informed Loss is the de-facto standard in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks. In this paper, we challenge this common practice by investigating the relationship between the loss function and the approximation quality of the learned solution. In particular, we leverage the concept of stability in the literature of partial differential equation to study the asymptotic behavior of the learned solution as the loss approaches zero. With this concept, we study an important class of high-dimensional non-linear PDEs in optimal control, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB) Equation, and prove that for general $L^p$ Physics-Informed Loss, a wide class of HJB equation is stable only if $p$ is sufficiently large. Therefore, the commonly used $L^2$ loss is not suitable for training PINN on those equations, while $L^{\\infty}$ loss is a better choice. Based on the theoretical insight, we develop a novel PINN training algorithm to minimize the $L^{\\infty}$ loss for HJB equations which is in a similar spirit to adversarial training. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically demonstrated through experiments.

Our\napproach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator,\nSPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby\nenabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers\nlinear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation.\nExperimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse\nattention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both\ntraining and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution\nfor effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Jang-Hyun Kim, Junyoung Yeom, Sangdoo Yun, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer\nlanguage models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As\nthe context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and\ncomputations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that\ncontinually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a\ncompact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory\nspace of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a\nlightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during\ninference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights.\nWe achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as\na single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation,\npersonalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach\nachieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller\ncontext memory size. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach\nin a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the\nsliding window approach. Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/snu-mllab/context-memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-06T10:50:43Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T05:53:02Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to Summarize Long Texts with Memory Compression and Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Jaehong Park, Jonathan Pilault, Christopher Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mem2Mem, a memory-to-memory mechanism for hierarchical recurrent\nneural network based encoder decoder architectures and we explore its use for\nabstractive document summarization. Mem2Mem transfers \"memories\" via\nreadable/writable external memory modules that augment both the encoder and\ndecoder. Our memory regularization compresses an encoded input article into a\nmore compact set of sentence representations. Most importantly, the memory\ncompression step performs implicit extraction without labels, sidestepping\nissues with suboptimal ground-truth data and exposure bias of hybrid\nextractive-abstractive summarization techniques. By allowing the decoder to\nread/write over the encoded input memory, the model learns to read salient\ninformation about the input article while keeping track of what has been\ngenerated. Our Mem2Mem approach yields results that are competitive with state\nof the art transformer based summarization methods, but with 16 times fewer\nparameters\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample\nimplementation of Samba is publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Minimum Description Length Hopfield Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network training stability\"*\n\n*Matan Abudy, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir*\n\n**Abstract:** Associative memory architectures are designed for memorization but also\noffer, through their retrieval method, a form of generalization to unseen\ninputs: stored memories can be seen as prototypes from this point of view.\nFocusing on Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN), we show that a large memorization\ncapacity undermines the generalization opportunity. We offer a solution to\nbetter optimize this tradeoff. It relies on Minimum Description Length (MDL) to\ndetermine during training which memories to store, as well as how many of them.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-11T09:23:54Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-11T09:23:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. In-Context Exemplars as Clues to Retrieving from Large Associative\n  Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network training stability\"*\n\n*Jiachen Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in\nnatural language processing. The most representative ability of LLMs is\nin-context learning (ICL), which enables LLMs to learn patterns from in-context\nexemplars without training. The performance of ICL greatly depends on the\nexemplars used. However, how to choose exemplars remains unclear due to the\nlack of understanding of how in-context learning works. In this paper, we\npresent a novel perspective on ICL by conceptualizing it as contextual\nretrieval from a model of associative memory. We establish a theoretical\nframework of ICL based on Hopfield Networks. Based on our framework, we look\ninto how in-context exemplars influence the performance of ICL and propose more\nefficient active exemplar selection. Our study sheds new light on the mechanism\nof ICL by connecting it to memory retrieval, with potential implications for\nadvancing the understanding of LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-06T20:13:29Z  (*Updated: 2023-12-18T21:09:51Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Efficient Attention: Attention with Linear Complexities\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Shuai Yi, Haiyu Zhao, Hongsheng Li, Zhuoran Shen, Mingyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset.

Adaptive User Modeling with Long and Short-Term Preferences for Personalized Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory attention integration language models\"*\n\n*Xing Xie, Zeping Yu, Jianxun Lian, Gongshen Liu, Ahmad Mahmoody*\n\n**Abstract:** User modeling is an essential task for online rec- ommender systems. In the past few decades, col- laborative filtering (CF) techniques have been well studied to model users\u2019 long term preferences. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown a great advantage in modeling users\u2019 short term preference. A natural way to improve the rec- ommender is to combine both long-term and short- term modeling. Previous approaches neglect the importance of dynamically integrating these two user modeling paradigms. Moreover, users\u2019 be- haviors are much more complex than sentences in language modeling or images in visual computing, thus the classical structures of RNN such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) need to be upgraded for better user modeling. In this paper, we im- prove the traditional RNN structure by proposing a time-aware controller and a content-aware con- troller, so that contextual information can be well considered to control the state transition. We fur- ther propose an attention-based framework to com- bine users\u2019 long-term and short-term preferences, thus users\u2019 representation can be generated adap- tively according to the specific context. We con- duct extensive experiments on both public and in- dustrial datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-art methods consistently.\n\n**Proceeding:** ijcai-2019-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. FastViT: A Fast Hybrid Vision Transformer using Structural Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Anurag Ranjan, Oncel Tuzel, Jeff Zhu, James Gabriel, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent amalgamation of transformer and convolutional designs has led to steady improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the models. In this work, we introduce FastViT, a hybrid vision transformer architecture that obtains the state-of-the-art latency-accuracy trade-off. To this end, we introduce a novel token mixing operator, RepMixer, a building block of FastViT, that uses structural reparameterization to lower the memory access cost by removing skip-connections in the network. We further apply train-time overparametrization and large kernel convolutions to boost accuracy and empirically show that these choices have minimal effect on latency. We show that - our model is 3.5x faster than CMT, a recent state-of-the-art hybrid transformer architecture, 4.9x faster than EfficientNet, and 1.9x faster than ConvNeXt on a mobile device for the same accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. At similar latency, our model obtains 4.2% better Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than MobileOne. Our model consistently outperforms competing architectures across several tasks -- image classification, detection, segmentation and 3D mesh regression with significant improvement in latency on both a mobile device and a desktop GPU. Furthermore, our model is highly robust to out-of-distribution samples and corruptions, improving over competing robust models.

An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory architectures transformers\"*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jan Kautz, Jared Casper, Vartika Singh, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Deepak Narayanan, Sudhakar Singh, Ali Hatamizadeh, Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Vijay Korthikanti, Brandon Norick, Duncan Riach, Wonmin Byeon, Roger Waleffe*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating different memory mechanisms, here are some key points and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Integration Techniques for Combining Different Memory Mechanisms\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- The concept of integrating multiple memory types is explored in papers that discuss combining transformer layers with other memory models. For instance, the paper on \"Robots Can Multitask Too: Integrating a Memory Architecture and LLMs\" proposes a dual-layered architecture that combines two LLMs with a memory model inspired by human cognition. This architecture supports the integration of sensory information, LLM agent prompting, and task-appropriate robot actions, highlighting the potential of hybrid memory architectures.\n- Another example is the use of a query layer at the end of standard transformer layers in the PanGu-\u03b1 model, which includes an additional embedding for the next position in the attention mechanism. This hybrid approach enhances the model's ability to predict the next token.\n\n### Memory-Attention Interaction Patterns\n- The interaction between memory and attention is crucial. Self-attention, cross-attention, sparse attention, and flash attention are discussed in the context of LLMs. Sparse attention, for example, calculates attention in sliding windows to speed up computations, which can be beneficial for large sequences.\n- The integration of memory heads with attention heads is also important. Research suggests that some attention heads can have opposite effects, and memory heads can recall knowledge from internal memory, which can be optimized for better performance.\n\n## Training Stability and Convergence\n\n### Training Dynamics of Memory-Augmented Models\n- Training stability is a significant concern when integrating memory mechanisms into LLMs. The paper on \"Robots Can Multitask Too\" highlights that relying solely on LLM's internal memory can lead to reasoning instability, and updating LLM parametric memory requires retraining and fine-tuning, which can be costly and affect robustness.\n- Modern Hopfield networks, which can store exponentially many patterns with one-step convergence, offer strong theoretical foundations for stable training dynamics. However, the interaction between these networks and other memory mechanisms needs careful investigation.\n\n### Convergence Properties of Hybrid Systems\n- The convergence properties of hybrid systems are critical. Universal Hopfield Networks provide a general framework with differing similarity and separation functions, which can help in understanding the convergence behavior of these hybrid models.\n\n### Stability Analysis Methods\n- Stability analysis methods are essential for ensuring the robustness of hybrid memory architectures. This involves evaluating the impact of memory on multi-task execution and testing the architecture with different families of LLMs to ensure stability and performance.\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n\n### Practical Implementations of Modern Hopfield Networks\n- Modern Hopfield networks can be practically implemented to enhance language models. These networks can store and retrieve patterns efficiently, which is beneficial for tasks requiring long-term memory. The integration of Hopfield networks with transformer architectures needs careful consideration of the interaction between these mechanisms.\n\n### Memory Access Optimization Techniques\n- Memory access optimization is crucial for efficient inference. Techniques like flash attention, which employs input tiling to minimize memory reads and writes, can significantly speed up computations. Similarly, product key memory enables fast nearest neighbor search, which can optimize memory access patterns.\n\n### Scaling Considerations for Large Models\n- Scaling considerations are vital for large models. The use of product key memory can significantly increase the capacity of the architecture with negligible computational overhead. This makes it feasible to scale up the model parameters efficiently.\n- The INFMOE framework proposed in the CPM-2 model dynamically offloads parameters to the CPU for inference, overlapping data movement with computation to reduce inference time. This strategy is particularly useful for large-scale models.\n\nIn summary, the integration of different memory mechanisms into autoregressive language models involves:\n- Hybrid architectures that combine transformer layers with other memory models.\n- Optimized memory-attention interaction patterns.\n- Ensuring training stability and convergence through careful analysis and the use of modern Hopfield networks.\n- Implementing practical memory access optimization techniques and scaling considerations to maintain efficiency and performance.\n\nThese approaches can help in designing more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 313  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new PyTorch layer is provided, called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We show that the transformer attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/37 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2202.12837, 2022b.

A Comparative Study on the Impact of Model Compression Techniques on Fairness in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression language models\"*\n\n*Krithika Ramesh, Arnav Chavan, Shrey Pandit, Sunayana Sitaram*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification and indicates that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Abstract:** Compression techniques for deep learning have become increasingly popular, particularly in settings where latency and memory constraints are imposed. Several methods, such as pruning, distillation, and quantization, have been adopted for compressing models, each providing distinct advantages. However, existing literature demonstrates that compressing deep learning models could affect their fairness. Our analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which we benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification. We also investigate the impact of using multilingual models and evaluation measures. Our findings highlight the significance of considering both the pre-trained model and the chosen compression strategy in developing equitable language technologies. The results also indicate that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. The Cost of Compression: Investigating the Impact of Compression on Parametric Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression language models\"*\n\n*Satya Sai, Srinath Namburi, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Srinath Srinivasan, Frederic Sala*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive analysis across multiple model families using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance, with a particular focus on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing large language models (LLMs), often consisting of billions of parameters, provides faster inference, smaller memory footprints, and enables local deployment. Two standard compression techniques are pruning and quantization, with the former eliminating redundant connections in model layers and the latter representing model parameters with fewer bits. The key tradeoff is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER, ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical insights to help make informed decisions on compression.

Lehner, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency, and introduces FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** In a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), an agent typically uses a representation of the past to approximate the underlying MDP. We propose to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer, we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results.

SlimFit: Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Transformer-based Models Using Training Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory training dynamics\"*\n\n*A. Ardakani, Altan Haan, Shangyin Tan, Doru-Thom Popovici, Alvin Cheung, Costin Iancu, Koushik Sen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new tool called SlimFit is introduced that reduces the memory requirements of transformer-based models by dynamically analyzing their training dynamics and freezing less-contributory layers during fine-tuning and enables fine-tuning them on a single 32GB GPU without any significant accuracy degradation.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models, such as BERT and ViT, have achieved state-of-the-art results across different natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, these models are extremely memory intensive during their fine-tuning process, making them difficult to deploy on GPUs with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we introduce a new tool called SlimFit that reduces the memory requirements of these models by dynamically analyzing their training dynamics and freezing less-contributory layers during fine-tuning. The layers to freeze are chosen using a runtime inter-layer scheduling algorithm. This allows SlimFit to freeze up to 95% of layers and reduce the overall on-device GPU memory usage of transformer-based models such as ViT and BERT by an average of 2.2x, across different NLP and CV benchmarks/datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD 2.0, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with an average degradation of 0.2% in accuracy. For such NLP and CV tasks, SlimFit can reduce up to 3.1x the total on-device memory usage with an accuracy degradation of only up to 0.4%. As a result, while fine-tuning of ViT on ImageNet and BERT on SQuAD 2.0 with a batch size of 128 requires 3 and 2 32GB GPUs, respectively, SlimFit enables fine-tuning them on a single 32GB GPU without any significant accuracy degradation.

NTK-SAP: Improving neural network pruning by aligning training dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory training dynamics\"*\n\n*Yite Wang, Dawei Li, Ruoyu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** The foresight pruning algorithm Neural Tangent Kernel Spectrum-Aware Pruning (NTK-SAP) is proposed, which achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets and is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning neural networks before training has received increasing interest due to its potential to reduce training time and memory. One popular method is to prune the connections based on a certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the NTK. This method can help maintain the NTK spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. However, one possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial point can be very different from the NTK corresponding to later iterates during the training phase. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the NTK spectrum. Note that our approach is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent. In addition, we use random inputs to compute the fixed-weight-NTK, making our method data-agnostic as well. We name our foresight pruning algorithm Neural Tangent Kernel Spectrum-Aware Pruning (NTK-SAP). Empirically, our method achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory training dynamics\"*\n\n*Jiawei Zhao, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Zhangyang Wang, A. Anandkumar, Yuandong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes GaLore, a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA, and demonstrates the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 91  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 7. Out-of-Distribution Detection based on In-Distribution Data Patterns Memorization with Modern Hopfield Energy\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network implementations\"*\n\n*Jinsong Zhang, Qiang Fu, Xu Chen, Lun Du, Zelin Li, Gang Wang, X. Liu, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simplified version of SHE, which utilizes only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class, has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks. OOD detection is challenging since DNN models may produce very high logits value even for OOD samples. Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate OOD data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the OOD sample with Hopfield energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution (ID) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern Hopfield Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version SHE with theoretical analysis. In SHE, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. SHE has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used OOD datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.

At the heart of our approach is STanHop, a novel Hopfield-based neural network block, which sparsely learns and stores both temporal and cross-series representations in a data-dependent fashion. In essence, STanHop sequentially learn temporal representation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield layers. In addition, StanHop incorporates two additional external memory modules: a Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and task-aware memory-enhancements, respectively. They allow StanHop-Net to swiftly respond to certain sudden events. Methodologically, we construct the StanHop-Net by stacking STanHop blocks in a hierarchical fashion, enabling multi-resolution feature extraction with resolution-specific sparsity. Theoretically, we introduce a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model (Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) and show that it endows a tighter memory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing memory capacity.

Simplicial Hopfield networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network implementations\"*\n\n*Thomas F Burns, T. Fukai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, these networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** Hopfield networks are artificial neural networks which store memory patterns on the states of their neurons by choosing recurrent connection weights and update rules such that the energy landscape of the network forms attractors around the memories. How many stable, sufficiently-attracting memory patterns can we store in such a network using $N$ neurons? The answer depends on the choice of weights and update rule. Inspired by setwise connectivity in biology, we extend Hopfield networks by adding setwise connections and embedding these connections in a simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are higher dimensional analogues of graphs which naturally represent collections of pairwise and setwise relationships. We show that our simplicial Hopfield networks increase memory storage capacity. Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, our networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts. Such scenarios include non-trivial simplicial topology. We also test analogous modern continuous Hopfield networks, offering a potentially promising avenue for improving the attention mechanism in Transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression language models\"*\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU\nmemory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify\nthe Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to\nalleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We\nintroduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that\nenables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and\ncomputational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a\nspecialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive\ngeneration algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method\ncompresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression\nratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within\na single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered\nan efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and\nposition identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental\nvalidation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational\nconsumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16T09:18:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-04T03:14:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression language models\"*\n\n*Jang-Hyun Kim, Junyoung Yeom, Sangdoo Yun, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer\nlanguage models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As\nthe context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and\ncomputations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that\ncontinually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a\ncompact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory\nspace of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a\nlightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during\ninference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights.\nWe achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as\na single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation,\npersonalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach\nachieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller\ncontext memory size. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach\nin a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the\nsliding window approach.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory training dynamics\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

However, a major blocking issue of applying BERT to online\nservices is that it is memory-intensive and leads to unsatisfactory latency of\nuser requests, raising the necessity of model compression. Existing solutions\nleverage the knowledge distillation framework to learn a smaller model that\nimitates the behaviors of BERT. However, the training procedure of knowledge\ndistillation is expensive itself as it requires sufficient training data to\nimitate the teacher model. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a\nhybrid solution named LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid\nmodel compression), which combines the advantages of different model\ncompression methods, including weight pruning, matrix factorization and\nknowledge distillation.

The new Hopfield network can store exponentially\n(with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the\npattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has\nthree types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed\npoint averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a\nsubset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new\nupdate rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This\nequivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models.\nThese heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in\nhigher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield\nnetwork can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow\nthe storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned\nprototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond\nfully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling,\nmemory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad\napplicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers\nimproved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance\nlearning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several\nhundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small\nclassification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield\nlayers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine\nlearning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two\ndrug design datasets.

Minimum Description Length Hopfield Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network implementations\"*\n\n*Matan Abudy, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir*\n\n**Abstract:** Associative memory architectures are designed for memorization but also\noffer, through their retrieval method, a form of generalization to unseen\ninputs: stored memories can be seen as prototypes from this point of view.\nFocusing on Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN), we show that a large memorization\ncapacity undermines the generalization opportunity. We offer a solution to\nbetter optimize this tradeoff. It relies on Minimum Description Length (MDL) to\ndetermine during training which memories to store, as well as how many of them.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-11T09:23:54Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-11T09:23:54Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control for Compressed Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory compression language models\"*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Yunhua Zhou, Dong Zhang, Bo wang, Pengyu Wang, Xinghao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \\textit{capability} to \\textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization.

Galvatron: Efficient Transformer Training over Multiple GPUs Using Automatic Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid memory training dynamics\"*\n\n*Bin Cui, Hailin Zhang, Xiaonan Nie, Chunan Shi, Youhe Jiang, Yujie Wang, Xupeng Miao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various domains of applications and gradually becomes the foundations of the advanced large deep learning (DL) models. However, how to train these models over multiple GPUs efficiently is still challenging due to a large number of parallelism choices. Existing DL systems either rely on manual efforts to make distributed training plans or apply parallelism combinations within a very limited search space. In this approach, we propose Galvatron, a new system framework that incorporates multiple popular parallelism dimensions and automatically finds the most efficient hybrid parallelism strategy. To better explore such a rarely huge search space, we 1) involve a decision tree to make decomposition and pruning based on some reasonable intuitions, and then 2) design a dynamic programming search algorithm to generate the optimal plan. Evaluations on four representative Transformer workloads show that Galvatron could perform automatically distributed training with different GPU memory budgets. Among all evluated scenarios, Galvatron always achieves superior system throughput compared to previous work with limited parallelism.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network implementations\"*\n\n*J J Hopfield*\n\n**Abstract:** Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.\n\n**Published:** 1982-01-15\n\n\n\n#### 4. Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"hopfield network implementations\"*\n\n*John J. Hopfield, Dmitry Krotov*\n\n**Abstract:** A model of associative memory is studied, which stores and reliably retrieves\nmany more patterns than the number of neurons in the network. We propose a\nsimple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks\ncommonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality,\na family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be\nconstructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern\nrecognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning\nside of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks\nwith one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the\nactivities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of\nactivation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified\npolynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply\nenergy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational\nproperties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher\nrectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The\nutility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical\ngate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.\n\n**Conference:** dense-associative-memory-for-pattern-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-06-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory compression, hybrid memory training dynamics, and efficient implementations including Hopfield networks, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques in Language Models\n\n### Compression Methods and Effectiveness\n- **PyramidInfer**: This method compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context, leveraging the consistency in attention weights. It achieves significant memory reduction (over 54% GPU memory reduction) without sacrificing performance, improving throughput by 2.2x compared to existing methods.\n- **L2 Norm Strategy for Cache Compression**: This approach compresses the KV cache based on the L2 norm of key projections and their correlation with attention scores. It reduces memory usage while maintaining performance, particularly effective for smaller models like the Llama family, and plans to be evaluated on larger models.\n- **BitStack**: This method offers fine-grained size control for compressed large language models through weight decomposition. It allows dynamic adjustment of model size based on memory availability, matching or surpassing quantization baselines even at extreme compression ratios.\n\n### Trade-offs Between Compression and Performance\n- The **PyramidInfer** method shows that significant memory savings can be achieved without compromising performance, indicating a favorable trade-off.\n- The **L2 Norm Strategy** also maintains performance while reducing memory, highlighting the effectiveness of this compression technique.\n- **BitStack** demonstrates that despite compression, the model can match or surpass the performance of strong quantization baselines, suggesting minimal trade-offs in performance for substantial memory savings.\n\n### Implementation Strategies for Compressed Memory\n- **Intermediate and Meta-Symbolic Compression**: These methods involve compressing repeated phrases and abstracting relationships between concepts, resulting in significant memory reduction (up to 80-90% in total) while preserving core concepts. This approach can be applied to knowledge-intensive conversations and other AI applications.\n\n## Training Dynamics of Hybrid Architectures\n\n### Stability Analysis of Hybrid Memory Systems\n- **Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models**: This work highlights the importance of stability in hybrid architectures that combine different memory types. It selectively compresses sequences into recurrent hidden states while maintaining the ability to recall memories precisely with attention mechanisms[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n### Convergence Properties\n- The stability and convergence of hybrid architectures are critical. For instance, **Samba** ensures that the compression process during training does not compromise the model's ability to recall memories, which is essential for convergence[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n- Hybrid architectures like **Samba** show strong performance by combining different memory types. The selective compression and memory access strategies improve efficiency without sacrificing performance[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n## Efficient Implementations\n\n### Modern Hopfield Network Implementations\n- **Hopfield Networks is All You Need**: This work introduces Hopfield networks as a powerful tool for exponential storage capacity. Modern implementations of Hopfield networks can be integrated into language models to enhance memory efficiency and capacity[Analysis Note, Reference 6].\n\n### Memory Access Optimization\n- **PyramidInfer** and the **L2 Norm Strategy** both optimize memory access by compressing the KV cache efficiently. These methods reduce the memory footprint while maintaining performance, which is crucial for optimizing memory access patterns.\n\n### Scaling Considerations\n- **BitStack** allows for fine-grained size control, enabling dynamic adjustment of model size based on memory availability. This is particularly beneficial for scaling models to larger sizes and varying memory environments.\n- **Samba** and other hybrid models emphasize the need for thorough investigation of scaling properties to ensure that the models perform well as they grow in size and complexity[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\nIn summary, the integration of techniques like **PyramidInfer**, **L2 Norm Strategy**, and **BitStack** for memory compression, along with the stability and performance considerations of hybrid architectures like **Samba**, and the efficient use of Hopfield networks, can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models. These approaches address memory efficiency, performance, and scalability, aligning well with the researcher's goals.\n",
