[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nA key challenge in sequence modeling is summarizing, or memorizing, long-term patterns in data informative for a particular task, such as classification, forecasting, or clustering. By definition, patterns are higher-level structures in the data that arise from multiple timesteps. However, patterns can oc-\n\n[^0]cur at multiple levels, corresponding to different timescales. For example, in studying energy consumption, patterned variations may occur within a day, between days, and quarterly. Similar salient multiscale trends appear in physiological time series such as dysfunctional glucose patterns in diabetic patients and anomalous heart beats in arrhythmic patients. Audio signals of speech may be described in terms of utterances, phonemes, and subphonemes. And, the multiscale structure of images and video has been well-studied. Even for data sources without an explicit multiscale interpretation, multiscale modeling approaches can provide an efficient mechanism for capturing long-range patterns. In this paper, we propose a general and reusable building block for sequence modeling-MultiresLaYERleveraging a multiscale approach to memorize past data. We view memory through the lens of multiresolution analysis (MRA) (Willsky, 2002), with a particular emphasis on wavelet analysis, a powerful tool from signal processing for compression, denoising, feature extraction, and more (Jawerth \\& Sweldens, 1994; Akansu et al., 2001). As discussed in Sec. 2, wavelet analyses can be computed in a computationally efficient manner and interpreted as a series of convolutions. However, our use of wavelets is a design choice and other MRA techniques could likewise be considered for memorizing patterns at different timescales. Taking inspiration from wavelets, the key component of MULTiresLaYer is a multiresolution convolution operation (MultiresCONV) that retains the overall tree-structure of MRA. We show that constructing a memory of the past at each timestep of the sequence using MultiresConV can be collectively implemented as a stack of carefully-placed dilated causal convolutions with filters shared between levels. In contrast to traditional wavelet analysis, however, we learn the filters and do so end-to-end. When we fix the filters to pre-defined wavelet filters, the MUltiresConv reduces to a traditional discrete wavelet transform, though we show the benefits of learning the filters in Sec. 5.5. The basic MultiresCONV building block can be stacked in a multitude of ways that are common in deep learning models (e.g., across multiple channels, vertically as multiple layers, etc.). Our model resembles WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016a) in the use of tree-structured dilated convolutions. However, our principle-guided design has distinct skip-connection structures and filter sharing patterns, resulting in significantly\nbetter parameter efficiency and performance (see Sec. 4 for further details). There is a rapidly growing literature on machine learning for sequence modeling. Popular classes of approaches include variants of recurrent networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997), self-attention networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), and state-space models (Gu et al., 2021).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n3. ## 3. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutions\n\nWe leverage the computation structure of DWT to construct a multiresolution memory for sequences. Given a sequence\n\n[^1]$\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ representing a discretely sampled signal, the DWT can be implemented by the following recursive computations for $\\mathbf{a}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1} \\triangleq\\left(\\mathbf{b}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{b}_{J-1}\\right)$ starting from $\\mathbf{a}_{J}(n)=\\mathbf{x}(n)^{2}:$\n\\[\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{a}_{j}(n) \\triangleq a_{j, n} & =\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\mathbf{a}_{j+1}(2 n+k) \\mathbf{h}_{0}(k) \\\\\n\\mathbf{b}_{j}(n) \\triangleq b_{j, n} & =\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\mathbf{a}_{j+1}(2 n+k) \\mathbf{h}_{1}(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\\]\n\nwhere the filters $\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ are determined by the class of wavelets. For Haar wavelets, we have $\\mathbf{h}_{0}=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{1}=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$. To decouple the underlying computation from the choice of filters, we define this procedure composed of convolution and downsampling at multiple scales as the multiresolution convolution operation:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1}=\\operatorname{MULTIRESCONV}\\left(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1}, J\\right)\n$$\n\nRecall, the coefficients $\\left\\{\\mathbf{a}_{0}(n)\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\mathbf{b}_{j}(n)\\right\\}$ serve as a multiresolution representation of $\\mathbf{x}$. When the filter values come from wavelets, we can perfectly reconstruct the original sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ from the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1}$ by inverting the recursive procedure. In other words, this procedure is powerful enough to give us perfect memory of the past, summarized by the coefficients. Instead of setting the filters to fixed values, however, we propose to use MUltiresCONV as a building block for sequence models by letting $\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1}$ be learnable. Learning the filters allows us to go beyond hand-designed wavelets while still keeping the multiresolution structure in our computation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/37 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nWe visualize this in Figs. 1 and 2. This approximation allows us to retain the coefficients that are the most important for reconstructing the recent input values. Although our ablation study of Sec. 5.5 did not highlight statistically significant differences between the two strategies, we use resolution fading in all of our experiments to bias the model to focus on memorizing the most recent information and for a simpler implementation-we provide an example PyTorch implementation in Appendix B. Similar techniques of upweighting recent history proved critical in state-space models (Gu et al., 2020a; 2021). In addition to the methods outlined above, an obvious next choice would be to dynamically select the relevant multiresolution components for the task at hand, perhaps via attention or $L_{1}$ regularization. We leave this as future work. ### 3.3. Multiple channels and the mixing layer\n\nThe above only describes a mapping between single-channel sequences. To deal with an input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}$ with $d$ channels, we adopt a simple strategy of stacking $d$ independent layers, which can be efficiently implemented using depthwise causal dilated convolutions. The $d$ output sequences, after passing through a nonlinear activation function, are then mixed by a $1 \\times 1$ convolution. Here, we use the GELU activation (Hendrycks \\& Gimpel, 2016). We note that this use of depthwise convolution followed by a mixing across channels has proven successful in a number of sequence modeling practices (Wu et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2021). ### 3.4. Stacking into deep models\n\nWe wrap the sequence modeling layer and the mixing layer in a residual network block (He et al., 2016) with gated linear activations (Dauphin et al., 2017) and identity skip connections (see Fig. 2). We observed that the gating mechanism improves our model performance, which is consistent with observations made in a number of other sequence models (Dauphin et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016b;a; Gu et al., 2021). We then stack multiple residual blocks into a deep model. Depending on the task, layer normalization ( Ba et al., 2016) or batch normalization (Ioffe \\& Szegedy, 2015) is applied after each residual block. We refer to this model as MultiresNet in our experiments. ### 3.5. Optimization and regularization\n\nWe use the Adam optimizer with default hyperparameters and decoupled weighted decay (Loshchilov \\& Hutter, 2018). Dropout is applied after the GELU and gated linear activation functions whenever overfitting is observed. ## 4. Related Work\n\nThere has been significant activity building convolutional neural networks for sequential data, inspired by applications in modeling audio (Waibel et al., 1989; Oord et al., 2016a) and natural language (Collobert et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). Recent work aims to improve the performance of such models through the use of gating units (Dauphin et al., 2017), depthwise convolution (Kaiser et al., 2018), input-dependent weights (Shen et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018), weight tying across depth (Bai et al., 2019), and adaptive filter size (Romero et al., 2022a). Our MultiresConv shares many ingredients of these works, but is unique in two aspects. First, our method explicitly defines memory units $\\mathbf{z}_{t}$, which are important for modeling long-range dependencies. Second, we have better theoretical underpinnings to our MultiresConv since it collapses to the standard DWT when the filters are specified as wavelet filters. Among all convolutional sequence models, the closest to our work is the WaveNet architecture proposed in Oord et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/35 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nKarami, M. and Ghodsi, A.

STCN: Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Emre Aksan, Otmar Hilliges*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchy of stochastic latent variables that captures temporal dependencies at different time-scales is proposed, which achieves state of the art log-likelihoods across several tasks and is capable of predicting high-quality synthetic samples over a long-range temporal horizon in modeling of handwritten text.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on many sequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while providing computational and modeling advantages due to inherent parallelism. However, currently there remains a performance gap to more expressive stochastic RNN variants, especially those with several layers of dependent random variables. In this work, we propose stochastic temporal convolutional networks (STCNs), a novel architecture that combines the computational advantages of temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with the representational power and robustness of stochastic latent spaces. In particular, we propose a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables that captures temporal dependencies at different time-scales. The architecture is modular and flexible due to the decoupling of the deterministic and stochastic layers. We show that the proposed architecture achieves state of the art log-likelihoods across several tasks. Finally, the model is capable of predicting high-quality synthetic samples over a long-range temporal horizon in modeling of handwritten text.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Convolutional Sequence Modeling Revisited\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Shaojie Bai, J. Z. Kolter, V. Koltun*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that it may be time to (re)consider ConvNets as the default \u201cgo to\u201d architecture for sequence modeling, and the potential \u201cinfinite memory\u201d advantage that RNNs have over TCNs is largely absent in practice.\n\n**Abstract:** Although both convolutional and recurrent architectures have a long history in sequence prediction, the current \u201cdefault\u201d mindset in much of the deep learning community is that generic sequence modeling is best handled using recurrent networks. Yet recent results indicate that convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on tasks such as audio synthesis and machine translation. Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should a practitioner use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. In particular, the models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We further show that the potential \u201cinfinite memory\u201d advantage that RNNs have over TCNs is largely absent in practice: TCNs indeed exhibit longer effective history sizes than their recurrent counterparts. As a whole, we argue that it may be time to (re)consider ConvNets as the default \u201cgo to\u201d architecture for sequence modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Approximation Theory of Convolutional Architectures for Time Series Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Haotian Jiang, Zhong Li, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results reveal that in this new setting, approximation efficiency is not only characterised by memory, but also additional fine structures in the target relationship, which leads to a novel definition of spectrum-based regularity that measures the complexity of temporal relationships under the convolutional approximation scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the approximation properties of convolutional architectures applied to time series modelling, which can be formulated mathematically as a functional approximation problem. In the recurrent setting, recent results reveal an intricate connection between approximation efficiency and memory structures in the data generation process. In this paper, we derive parallel results for convolutional architectures, with WaveNet being a prime example. Our results reveal that in this new setting, approximation efficiency is not only characterised by memory, but also additional fine structures in the target relationship. This leads to a novel definition of spectrum-based regularity that measures the complexity of temporal relationships under the convolutional approximation scheme. These analyses provide a foundation to understand the differences between architectural choices for time series modelling and can give theoretically grounded guidance for practical applications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Sequencer: Deep LSTM for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Masato Taki, Yuki Tatsunami*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent computer vision research, the advent of the Vision Transformer (ViT) has rapidly revolutionized various architectural design efforts: ViT achieved state-of-the-art image classification performance using self-attention found in natural language processing, and MLP-Mixer achieved competitive performance using simple multi-layer perceptrons. In contrast, several studies have also suggested that carefully redesigned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve advanced performance comparable to ViT without resorting to these new ideas. Against this background, there is growing interest in what inductive bias is suitable for computer vision. Here we propose Sequencer, a novel and competitive architecture alternative to ViT that provides a new perspective on these issues. Unlike ViTs, Sequencer models long-range dependencies using LSTMs rather than self-attention layers. We also propose a two-dimensional version of Sequencer module, where an LSTM is decomposed into vertical and horizontal LSTMs to enhance performance. Despite its simplicity, several experiments demonstrate that Sequencer performs impressively well: Sequencer2D-L, with 54M parameters, realizes 84.6% top-1 accuracy on only ImageNet-1K. Not only that, we show that it has good transferability and the robust resolution adaptability on double resolution-band.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Non-Autoregressive Semantic Parsing for Compositional Task-Oriented Dialog\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Marjan Ghazvininejad, Angela Fan, Ahmed Aly, Armen Aghajanyan, Akshat Shrivastava, Arun Babu*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic parsing using sequence-to-sequence models allows parsing of deeper representations compared to traditional word tagging based models. In spite of these advantages, widespread adoption of these models for real-time conversational use cases has been stymied by higher compute requirements and thus higher latency. In this work, we propose a non-autoregressive approach to predict semantic parse trees with an efficient seq2seq model architecture. By combining non-autoregressive prediction with convolutional neural networks, we achieve significant latency gains and parameter size reduction compared to traditional RNN models. Our novel architecture achieves up to an 81% reduction in latency on TOP dataset and retains competitive performance to non-pretrained models on three different semantic parsing datasets.

DenseCap: Fully Convolutional Localization Networks for Dense Captioning\n\n*From Search Query: Novel convolutional architectures for sequence modeling*\n\n*Li Fei-Fei, Justin Johnson, Andrej Karpathy*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the dense captioning task, which requires a computer vision\nsystem to both localize and describe salient regions in images in natural\nlanguage. The dense captioning task generalizes object detection when the\ndescriptions consist of a single word, and Image Captioning when one predicted\nregion covers the full image. To address the localization and description task\njointly we propose a Fully Convolutional Localization Network (FCLN)\narchitecture that processes an image with a single, efficient forward pass,\nrequires no external regions proposals, and can be trained end-to-end with a\nsingle round of optimization. The architecture is composed of a Convolutional\nNetwork, a novel dense localization layer, and Recurrent Neural Network\nlanguage model that generates the label sequences. We evaluate our network on\nthe Visual Genome dataset, which comprises 94,000 images and 4,100,000\nregion-grounded captions. We observe both speed and accuracy improvements over\nbaselines based on current state of the art approaches in both generation and\nretrieval settings.\n\n**Conference:** densecap-fully-convolutional-localization-1\n\n**Published:** 2015-11-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher design a novel convolutional block for sequence modeling that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key insights and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n### Adaptive and Dynamic Convolutional Techniques\n\n- The concept of **dynamic filter generation** is particularly relevant. For instance, the paper on \"Selective and Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling\" introduces the idea of input-dependent dynamics, where the model adjusts its state transitions based on the input content. This can be adapted to convolutional filters, allowing them to dynamically adjust their parameters based on the sequence context.\n\n### Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction\n\n- Incorporating **wavelet transforms** into convolutional neural networks can enable multiscale feature extraction. This approach is similar to the one described in the MLSNet model, which uses multisize convolutional fusion to capture DNA sequence features across various scales. Applying this to sequence modeling could enhance the capture of both local and global patterns.\n\n### Spectral Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Spectral attention mechanisms** can be integrated into convolutional layers to selectively focus on specific frequency components of the input sequence. This is analogous to the spectral attention mechanism mentioned in the context of graph convolutional networks, which could be adapted for sequence modeling to improve the capture of complex dependencies across different scales.\n\n### Hierarchical Convolutional Layers\n\n- **Hierarchical convolutional layers** with progressively increasing receptive fields can capture long-range dependencies efficiently. This approach is similar to the hierarchical feature extraction seen in MLSNet, where multisize convolutional fusion is used to capture features at different scales. Applying this hierarchy to convolutional layers can balance efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n### Emerging Research and Interdisciplinary Approaches\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**, such as S7, have shown significant improvements in sequence modeling by combining the efficiency of recurrent architectures with adaptive processing capabilities. These models dynamically adjust state transitions based on input content, which could be a valuable inspiration for designing adaptive convolutional filters.\n\n- **Graph Neural Networks** and **signal processing techniques** can also provide insights. For example, the use of spectral attention in graph neural networks can be adapted to sequence modeling to enhance the capture of complex dependencies.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **S7 State Space Model**:\n   - This model introduces input-dependent dynamics, which can be a blueprint for designing adaptive convolutional filters.

This approach can be adapted for general sequence modeling to enhance the capture of hierarchical and multiscale features.\n\n3. **Convolutional Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting**:\n   - Recent studies have shown that convolutional networks can perform comparably or even better than RNNs in time series forecasting. Dilated convolutions and depthwise separable convolutions can be efficient and effective in capturing time series dependences, which is relevant for sequence modeling.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the latest research (2023-2024) on convolutional sequence modeling, focusing on adaptive, dynamic, and hierarchical techniques.\n- **Experimental Design**: Design experiments to test the integration of wavelet transforms, spectral attention mechanisms, and hierarchical convolutional layers within the Conv GAU framework.\n- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Explore how concepts from graph neural networks, signal processing, and state space models can be adapted and integrated into the Conv GAU design.\n\nBy focusing on these innovative and less-explored techniques, the researcher can develop a novel convolutional block that significantly enhances the performance of sequence modeling tasks.\n",

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/35 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nKarami, M. and Ghodsi, A.

Whether predicting future video frames [1, 2], modeling traffic patterns [3, 4], or forecasting weather [5, 6], deep spatiotemporal modeling requires simultaneously capturing local spatial structure and long-range temporal dependencies. Although there has been progress in deep generative modeling of complex spatiotemporal data [7-12], most prior work has only considered short sequences of 20-50 timesteps due to the costs of processing long spatiotemporal sequences. Recent work has begun considering sequences of hundreds to thousands of timesteps [13-16]. As hardware and data collection of long spatiotemporal sequences continue to improve, new modeling approaches are required that scale efficiently with sequence length and effectively capture long-range dependencies. [^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d6faac708d10b5b87bdcg-02.jpg?height=440&width=1400&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=360)\n\nFigure 1: ConvRNNs $[17,18]$ (left) model spatiotemporal sequences using tensor-valued states, $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { X }}_{k}$, and a nonlinear RNN update, $\\mathbf{G}()$, that uses convolutions instead of matrix-vector multiplications. A position-wise nonlinear function, $\\mathbf{h}()$, transforms the states into the output sequence. Deep SSMs [19, 20] (center) model vector-valued input sequences using a discretized linear SSM. The linear dynamics can be exploited to parallelize computations across the sequence and capture long-range dependencies. We introduce ConvSSMs (right) that model spatiotemporal data using tensor states, like ConvRNNs, and linear dynamics, like SSMs. We also introduce an efficient ConvSSM variant, ConvS5, that can be parallelized across the sequence with parallel scans, has fast autoregressive generation, and captures long-range dependencies. Convolutional recurrent networks (ConvRNNs) such as ConvLSTM [17] and ConvGRU [18] are common approaches for spatiotemporal modeling. These methods encode the spatial information using tensor-structured states. The states are updated with recurrent neural network (RNN) equations that use convolutions instead of the matrix-vector multiplications in standard RNNs (e.g., LSTM/GRUs [21, 22]). This approach allows the RNN states to reflect the spatial structure of the data while simultaneously capturing temporal dynamics. ConvRNNs inherit both the benefits and the weaknesses of RNNs: they allow fast, stateful autoregressive generation and an unbounded context window, but they are slow to train due to their inherently sequential structure and can suffer from the vanishing/exploding gradient problem [23]. Transformer-based methods [ $9,13,14,24-27]$ operate on an entire sequence in parallel, avoiding these training challenges. Transformers typically require sophisticated compression schemes [28-30] to reduce the spatiotemporal sequence into tokens. Moreover, Transformers use an attention mechanism that has a bounded context window and whose computational complexity scales quadratically in sequence length for training and inference [31, 32]. More efficient Transformer methods improve on the complexity of attention [33-39], but these methods can fail on sequences with long-range dependencies [40, 13]. Some approaches combine Transformers with specialized training frameworks to address the attention costs [13]. However, recent work in deep state space models (SSMs) [19, 41, 42, 20, 43], like S4 [19] and S5 [20], has sought to overcome attention's quadratic complexity while maintaining the parallelizability and performance of attention and the statefulness of RNNs. These SSM layers have proven to be effective in various domains such as speech [44], images [45] and video classification [45, 46]; reinforcement learning [47, 48]; forecasting [49] and language modeling [50-53]. Inspired by modeling ideas from ConvRNNs and SSMs, we introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSMs), which have a tensor-structured state like ConvRNNs but a continuous-time parameterization and linear state updates like SSM layers.\n```\n\n#### 5.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML'20.

Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Kernel-Based Approaches for Sequence Modeling: Connections to Neural Methods\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive convolutional filters for sequence modeling*\n\n*Kevin J Liang, Guoyin Wang, Yitong Li, Ricardo Henao, L. Carin*\n\n**TL;DR:** By considering dynamic gating of the memory cell, a model closely related to the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is derived and its variants perform on par or even better than traditional neural methods.\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate time-dependent data analysis from the perspective of recurrent kernel machines, from which models with hidden units and gated memory cells arise naturally. By considering dynamic gating of the memory cell, a model closely related to the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is derived. Extending this setup to $n$-gram filters, the convolutional neural network (CNN), Gated CNN, and recurrent additive network (RAN) are also recovered as special cases. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the LSTM, while also extending it to $n$-gram convolutional filters. Experiments are performed on natural language processing tasks and on analysis of local field potentials (neuroscience). We demonstrate that the variants we derive from kernels perform on par or even better than traditional neural methods. For the neuroscience application, the new models demonstrate significant improvements relative to the prior state of the art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. SCINet: Time Series Modeling and Forecasting with Sample Convolution and Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive convolutional filters for sequence modeling*\n\n*Minhao Liu, Ailing Zeng, Mu-Hwa Chen, Zhijian Xu, Qiuxia Lai, Lingna Ma, Qiang Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural network architecture that conducts sample convolution and interaction for temporal modeling and forecasting, named SCINet, which is a recursive downsample-convolve-interact architecture that achieves significant forecasting accuracy improvements over both existing convolutional models and Transformer-based solutions across various real-world time series forecasting datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** One unique property of time series is that the temporal relations are largely preserved after downsampling into two sub-sequences. By taking advantage of this property, we propose a novel neural network architecture that conducts sample convolution and interaction for temporal modeling and forecasting, named SCINet. Specifically, SCINet is a recursive downsample-convolve-interact architecture. In each layer, we use multiple convolutional filters to extract distinct yet valuable temporal features from the downsampled sub-sequences or features. By combining these rich features aggregated from multiple resolutions, SCINet effectively models time series with complex temporal dynamics. Experimental results show that SCINet achieves significant forecasting accuracy improvements over both existing convolutional models and Transformer-based solutions across various real-world time series forecasting datasets.

To address this weakness, we propose a new model, MixHop, that can learn these relationships, including difference operators, by repeatedly mixing feature representations of neighbors at various distances. Mixhop requires no additional memory or computational complexity, and outperforms on challenging baselines. In addition, we propose sparsity regularization that allows us to visualize how the network prioritizes neighborhood information across different graph datasets. Our analysis of the learned architectures reveals that neighborhood mixing varies per datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 775  (*Influential: 110*)\n\n#### 5. Graph Metanetworks for Processing Diverse Neural Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: Graph-inspired convolutional architectures*\n\n*Derek Lim, Haggai Maron, Marc T. Law, Jonathan Lorraine, James Lucas*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged, and generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks efficiently encode learned information within their parameters. Consequently, many tasks can be unified by treating neural networks themselves as input data. When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the importance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces. However, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such as MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such architectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks - neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on several metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6.

CoAtNet: Marrying Convolution and Attention for All Data Sizes\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms*\n\n*Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V.

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 991  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 8. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

MOAT: Alternating Mobile Convolution and Attention Brings Strong Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms*\n\n*Chenglin Yang, Siyuan Qiao, Qihang Yu, Xiaoding Yuan, Yukun Zhu, A. Yuille, Hartwig Adam, Liang-Chieh Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** The simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of convolution and self-attention, and the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents MOAT, a family of neural networks that build on top of MObile convolution (i.e., inverted residual blocks) and ATtention. Unlike the current works that stack separate mobile convolution and transformer blocks, we effectively merge them into a MOAT block. Starting with a standard Transformer block, we replace its multi-layer perceptron with a mobile convolution block, and further reorder it before the self-attention operation. The mobile convolution block not only enhances the network representation capacity, but also produces better downsampled features. Our conceptually simple MOAT networks are surprisingly effective, achieving 89.1% / 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K / ImageNet-1K-V2 with ImageNet22K pretraining. Additionally, MOAT can be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution inputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention. Thanks to the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting mechanism. As a result, on COCO object detection, MOAT achieves 59.2% box AP with 227M model parameters (single-scale inference, and hard NMS), and on ADE20K semantic segmentation, MOAT attains 57.6% mIoU with 496M model parameters (single-scale inference). Finally, the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. The tiny-MOAT family is also benchmarked on downstream tasks, serving as a baseline for the community. We hope our simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of convolution and self-attention.

Seq-U-Net: A One-Dimensional Causal U-Net for Efficient Sequence Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive convolutional filters for sequence modeling*\n\n*Daniel Stoller, Simon Dixon, Sebastian Ewert, Mi Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dilated filters such as the Wavenet or the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) have shown good results in a variety of sequence modelling tasks. However, efficiently modelling long-term dependencies in these sequences is still challenging. Although the receptive field of these models grows exponentially with the number of layers, computing the convolutions over very long sequences of features in each layer is time and memory-intensive, prohibiting the use of longer receptive fields in practice. To increase efficiency, we make use of the \"slow feature\" hypothesis stating that many features of interest are slowly varying over time. For this, we use a U-Net architecture that computes features at multiple time-scales and adapt it to our auto-regressive scenario by making convolutions causal. We apply our model (\"Seq-U-Net\") to a variety of tasks including language and audio generation. In comparison to TCN and Wavenet, our network consistently saves memory and computation time, with speed-ups for training and inference of over 4x in the audio generation experiment in particular, while achieving a comparable performance in all tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Recurrent Filter Learning for Visual Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive convolutional filters for sequence modeling*\n\n*Tianyu Yang, Antoni B. Chan*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has gained popularity in\nvisual tracking, due to its robust feature representation of images. Recent\nmethods perform online tracking by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model to the\nspecific target object using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\nback-propagation, which is usually time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a\nrecurrent filter generation methods for visual tracking. We directly feed the\ntarget's image patch to a recurrent neural network (RNN) to estimate an\nobject-specific filter for tracking. As the video sequence is a spatiotemporal\ndata, we extend the matrix multiplications of the fully-connected layers of the\nRNN to a convolution operation on feature maps, which preserves the target's\nspatial structure and also is memory-efficient. The tracked object in the\nsubsequent frames will be fed into the RNN to adapt the generated filters to\nappearance variations of the target. Note that once the off-line training\nprocess of our network is finished, there is no need to fine-tune the network\nfor specific objects, which makes our approach more efficient than methods that\nuse iterative fine-tuning to online learn the target. Extensive experiments\nconducted on widely used benchmarks, OTB and VOT, demonstrate encouraging\nresults compared to other recent methods.\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. EvolveGCN: Evolving Graph Convolutional Networks for Dynamic Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: Graph-inspired convolutional architectures*\n\n*Charles E. Leiserson, Tao B. Schardl, Jie Chen, Giacomo Domeniconi, Toyotaro Suzumura, Tim Kaler, Tengfei Ma, Hiroki Kanezashi, Aldo Pareja*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph representation learning resurges as a trending research subject owing to the widespread use of deep learning for Euclidean data, which inspire various creative designs of neural networks in the non-Euclidean domain, particularly graphs. With the success of these graph neural networks (GNN) in the static setting, we approach further practical scenarios where the graph dynamically evolves. Existing approaches typically resort to node embeddings and use a recurrent neural network (RNN, broadly speaking) to regulate the embeddings and learn the temporal dynamics. These methods require the knowledge of a node in the full time span (including both training and testing) and are less applicable to the frequent change of the node set. In some extreme scenarios, the node sets at different time steps may completely differ. To resolve this challenge, we propose EvolveGCN, which adapts the graph convolutional network (GCN) model along the temporal dimension without resorting to node embeddings. The proposed approach captures the dynamism of the graph sequence through using an RNN to evolve the GCN parameters. Two architectures are considered for the parameter evolution. We evaluate the proposed approach on tasks including link prediction, edge classification, and node classification. The experimental results indicate a generally higher performance of EvolveGCN compared with related approaches.

Vision GNN: An Image is Worth Graph of Nodes\n\n*From Search Query: Graph-inspired convolutional architectures*\n\n*Enhua Wu, Yehui Tang, Jianyuan Guo, Yunhe Wang, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Network architecture plays a key role in the deep learning-based computer vision system. The widely-used convolutional neural network and transformer treat the image as a grid or sequence structure, which is not flexible to capture irregular and complex objects. In this paper, we propose to represent the image as a graph structure and introduce a new Vision GNN (ViG) architecture to extract graph-level feature for visual tasks. We first split the image to a number of patches which are viewed as nodes, and construct a graph by connecting the nearest neighbors. Based on the graph representation of images, we build our ViG model to transform and exchange information among all the nodes. ViG consists of two basic modules: Grapher module with graph convolution for aggregating and updating graph information, and FFN module with two linear layers for node feature transformation. Both isotropic and pyramid architectures of ViG are built with different model sizes. Extensive experiments on image recognition and object detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of our ViG architecture. We hope this pioneering study of GNN on general visual tasks will provide useful inspiration and experience for future research.

ViTMatte: Boosting Image Matting with Pretrained Plain Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms*\n\n*Baoyuan Wang, Shusheng Yang, Xinggang Wang, Jingfeng Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to their strong modeling capacity and large-scale pretraining. However, they have not yet conquered the problem of image matting. We hypothesize that image matting could also be boosted by ViTs and present a new efficient and robust ViT-based matting system, named ViTMatte. Our method utilizes (i) a hybrid attention mechanism combined with a convolution neck to help ViTs achieve an excellent performance-computation trade-off in matting tasks. (ii) Additionally, we introduce the detail capture module, which just consists of simple lightweight convolutions to complement the detailed information required by matting. To the best of our knowledge, ViTMatte is the first work to unleash the potential of ViT on image matting with concise adaptation. It inherits many superior properties from ViT to matting, including various pretraining strategies, concise architecture design, and flexible inference strategies. We evaluate ViTMatte on Composition-1k and Distinctions-646, the most commonly used benchmark for image matting, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms prior matting works by a large margin.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 6. Next-ViT: Next Generation Vision Transformer for Efficient Deployment in Realistic Industrial Scenarios\n\n*From Search Query: Hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms*\n\n*Xin Pan, Min Zheng, Rui Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Xing Wang, Huixia Li, Wei Li, Xin Xia, Jiashi Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the complex attention mechanisms and model design, most existing vision Transformers (ViTs) can not perform as efficiently as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in realistic industrial deployment scenarios, e.g. TensorRT and CoreML. This poses a distinct challenge: Can a visual neural network be designed to infer as fast as CNNs and perform as powerful as ViTs? Recent works have tried to design CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures to address this issue, yet the overall performance of these works is far away from satisfactory. To end these, we propose a next generation vision Transformer for efficient deployment in realistic industrial scenarios, namely Next-ViT, which dominates both CNNs and ViTs from the perspective of latency/accuracy trade-off. In this work, the Next Convolution Block (NCB) and Next Transformer Block (NTB) are respectively developed to capture local and global information with deployment-friendly mechanisms. Then, Next Hybrid Strategy (NHS) is designed to stack NCB and NTB in an efficient hybrid paradigm, which boosts performance in various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that Next-ViT significantly outperforms existing CNNs, ViTs and CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across various vision tasks. On TensorRT, Next-ViT surpasses ResNet by 5.5 mAP (from 40.4 to 45.9) on COCO detection and 7.7% mIoU (from 38.8% to 46.5%) on ADE20K segmentation under similar latency. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance with CSWin, while the inference speed is accelerated by 3.6x. On CoreML, Next-ViT surpasses EfficientFormer by 4.6 mAP (from 42.6 to 47.2) on COCO detection and 3.5% mIoU (from 45.1% to 48.6%) on ADE20K segmentation under similar latency.

For example, incorporating GNN-inspired convolutions could help in modeling hierarchical and syntactic structures inherent in language data, as suggested in the analysis note.\n\n### Hybrid Attention-Convolution Mechanisms\n\n- Combining attention mechanisms with convolutional operations can selectively focus on specific parts of the input sequence.\n  - The idea of **spectral attention mechanisms** and **gated attention-convolution integration** is highlighted in the analysis note. These mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n  - For instance, models like **SMR (State Memory Replay)** and **STCN (Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks)** show how integrating memory and convolutional operations can improve the modeling of temporal dependencies.\n\n### Key Insights and Techniques\n\n- **Dynamic Filter Generation and Adaptive Convolutions:**\n  - Models like S7 and STCN demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic and adaptive convolutional strategies. These models adjust their parameters or state transitions based on the input, which can be crucial for capturing context-dependent dependencies.\n\n- **Multiresolution and Hierarchical Convolutional Architectures:**\n  - Techniques such as **Multiresolution Convolutional Memory** and **hierarchical convolutional architectures** with progressively increasing receptive fields can help in capturing both fine-grained and long-term dependencies efficiently.\n\n- **Efficiency Enhancements:**\n  - Using **depthwise separable convolutions** and **shared filter strategies** can reduce computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance, which is essential for scaling the model.\n\n### Relevant References and Concepts\n\n- **S7 Model:**\n  - This model dynamically adjusts state transitions based on input content, making it highly relevant for adaptive and dynamic convolutional filters.\n\n- **STCN and SMR:**\n  - These models introduce stochastic latent variables and state memory replay, respectively, to capture temporal dependencies at different scales, which aligns with the need for adaptive and hierarchical convolutional architectures.\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures:**\n  - Combining state space models with convolutional layers, as seen in **MambaMixer**, can enhance the model's ability to retain and access long-term dependencies efficiently.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and techniques, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages adaptive and dynamic convolutional filters, graph-inspired architectures, and hybrid attention-convolution mechanisms to outperform existing state-of-the-art models in sequence modeling tasks.\n",

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented. TNL outperforms existing efficient language models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art large language models using conventional transformer architectures. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

By addressing the limitations of linear attention in varying sequence lengths without increasing memory consumption, this advancement democratizes access to state-of-the-art language models, potentially reducing the computational and environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems.

The Neural Data Router: Adaptive Control Flow in Transformers Improves Systematic Generalization  (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*R. Csord\u00e1s, Kazuki Irie, J.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing. Our code is public.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/47 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n(4). This enables the architecture to get away with a number of computational steps reflecting the depth of the computational graph rather than the length of the input. Bottom up approach for improving model architectures. Transformers have seen tremendous successes across various application domains (Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al, 2020, Dosovitskiy et al. 2021). Impressive results have been reported when they are scaled up with a large amount of data (Brown et al. 2020). On the other hand, simple tasks like those highlighted in the present work demonstrate that the Transformer architecture still struggles with basic reasoning. Particularly in algorithmic tasks, it is often the case that a sub-optimal choice of architecture/optimization method makes the model fall back to simple memorization. We argue that it is crucial to look at isolated problems which test specific generalization capability. This calls for a bottom-up approach: building on toy tasks that focus on individual aspects of generalization and using them for improving models. ## 6 RELATED WORK\n\nGating inside Transformers. Several prior works have proposed to use some sort of gating within Transformer architectures (Parisotto et al. 2020, Chaabouni et al. 2021). Our proposed copy gate\nis different from those as it satisfies two important properties. First, our copy gate allows the model to skip the entire Transformer layer (i.e., both the self-attention and the feedforward blocks) when the gate is closed. Second, the gate function is conditioned on the attention output such that the decision of opening or closing depends on information from all columns. While multiple gating variants have been proposed by Parisotto et al. (2020) to stabilize Transformers for reinforcement learning, none of them can produce this behavior. Empirically, we also tried out a few other gating variants which do not satisfy the two properties above; we found them not to improve over regular Transformers in our preliminary experiments on compositional table lookup. Recent work by Chaabouni et al. (2021) also makes use of \"gating\" in Transformers through a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function commonly used in convolutional NNs (Dauphin et al., 2017). Transformer models with such an activation function were reported to outperform RNN baselines on a systematic generalization task (Dess\u00ec \\& Baroni, 2019). Unlike our copy gate or Parisotto et al. (2020)'s gating, such a gating activation does not have the \"residual\" term (i.e. a closed gate zeros out the input) which allows the model to skip a transformation. In a more general context, benefits of the GLU activation in Transformers vary across tasks (Irie et al. 2019; Shazeer, 2020). In language modeling, no improvement is typically obtained by using the standard highway gate instead of the residual connection in Transformers (Irie, 2020), while it yields improvements when combined with convolutional layers Kim \\& Rush, 2016). Parameterized geometric distributions. Two recent works (Brooks et al., 2021, Banino et al., 2021) have used a form of parameterized geometric distribution (PGD; in the form of Eq. 77. Brooks et al. (2021) have used such a distribution to parameterize the movement of a pointer on a sequence of instructions. Banino et al. (2021) have used it to implement adaptive computation time (Schmidhuber, 2012, Graves, 2016). We use the PGD to obtain a generic attention mechanism as a replacement of the standard self-attention used in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Compositional table lookup. CTL task was proposed for evaluating the compositional ability of NNs (Liska et al., 2018). Previous works evaluated RNNs, RNNs with attention, and Transformers on this task with limited success (Hupkes et al., 2019, Dubois et al., 2020). Dubois et al. (2020) have proposed a special attention mechanism to augment the recurrent architecture. While they obtained good performance for the forward presentation order, the proposed model failed in the backward one. In contrast, two of our approaches (Sec. 3.1) achieve $100 \\%$ generalization accuracy for both orders. Positional encodings. Many previous works have focused on improving positional encoding (Schmidhuber, 1992; Vaswani et al., 2017) for self-attention. Most notably, the relative positional encoding (Schmidhuber, 1992; Shaw et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019) was found useful for improving systematic generalization of Transformers (Csord\u00e1s et al., 2021). Here we also present two new approaches related to positional encoding. One is the gated combination of absolute and relative positional encoding (Sec. 3.1, details in Appendix B. We show that absolute positional encoding can complement relative positional encoding. The former enables the model to always attend to a specific position, as is needed for the CTL task in the last step, while the gating allows it to use relative positional encoding for other positions/steps. Second, we introduce directional encoding to augment geometric attention. Unlike positional encoding which can overfit to a range of positions seen during training, the direction information is found to be robust and to be a crucial augmentation of the geometric attention. ## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe proposed a new view on the internal operations of Transformer encoders as a dynamic dataflow architecture between Transformer columns. This overcomes two shortcomings of traditional Transformers: the problem of routing and retaining data in an unaltered fashion, which we solve by an additional copy gate, and the problem of learning length-independent attention patterns, which we solve by geometric attention. Our new model, the Neural Data Router (NDR), generalizes to compositions longer than those seen during training on the popular compositional lookup table task in both forward and backward directions. NDR also achieves near perfect performance on simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks in settings that test systematic generalization in terms of computational depth. In general, the gates and the attention maps collectively make the architecture more interpretable than the baselines. Future work will extend this encoder-only architecture to a full sequence-to-sequence model and evaluate it on other standard tasks in systematic generalization requiring generation of variable-length output sequences. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Imanol Schlag and Sjoerd van Steenkiste for helpful discussions and suggestions on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 4. Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence for Sequence Modeling (Avg.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/15 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_539af27a11cae64ab314g-09.jpg?height=413&width=856&top_left_y=1105&top_left_x=626)\n\nFigure 8: We plot the state transitions of the trained model for a random test input batch at layers 0 and 8 . We observe structured patterns in the data-controlled state transition. While we leave interpretability for future work, we point out that these patterns indicate that the trained model deliberately utilizes the data-controlled gating of the state transition (and thus forgetting and retention of memories) by applying large varieties of magnitudes and phases. ## 6 Future Work\n\nWhile our primary focus in this paper is to establish the groundwork for constructing fully datacontrolled linear RNNs, we recognize the multitude of opportunities for future research. One avenue involves exploring the effects of different initialization strategies, amplitude- and phase-activations. Moreover, we suggest that future work should pay focus to the interpretability of the learned state transitions for gaining deeper insights into the model's inner workings. ## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe introduce GateLoop, a fully data-controlled linear RNN which generalizes existing linear recurrent models by leveraging data controlled gating of inputs and outputs and state transitions. While our method comes with linear runtime complexity $O(l)$, we derive an efficient parallelizable $O(l \\log l)$ training strategy utilizing parallel scans. Furthermore, GateLoop can be reformulated in an equivalent $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ surrogate attention mode which reveals, that its mechanism can be interpreted as providing relative positional information to Attention. Finally we validate empirically, that fully data-controlled linear recurrence is highly performant for autoregressive language modeling. ## REFERENCES\n\nGuy Blelloch.

Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Transition-based Dependency Parsing Using Two Heterogeneous Gated Recursive Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gated graph neural networks*\n\n*Xinchi Chen, Yaqian Zhou, Chenxi Zhu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two heterogeneous gated recursion neural networks are proposed: tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic graph structuredgated recursive Neural Network (DAG- GRNN), which integrate to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for transition-based dependency parsing.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural network based dependency parsing has attracted much interest, which can effectively alleviate the problems of data sparsity and feature engineering by using the dense features. However, it is still a challenge problem to sufficiently model the complicated syntactic and semantic compositions of the dense features in neural network based methods. In this paper, we propose two heterogeneous gated recursive neural networks: tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic graph structured gated recursive neural network (DAG-GRNN). Then we integrate them to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for transition-based dependency parsing. Specifically, Tree-GRNN models the feature combinations for the trees in stack, which already have partial dependency structures. DAG-GRNN models the feature combinations of the nodes whose dependency relations have not been built yet. Experiment results on two prevalent benchmark datasets (PTB3 and CTB5) show the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks.

Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph convolutional networks*\n\n*Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr., Kilian Q. Weinberger, Tianyi Zhang, Tao Yu, Felix Wu, Christopher Fifty*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have experienced significant attention and have become the de facto methods for learning graph representations. GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper, we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-19\n\n\n\n#### 5. Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph convolutional networks*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Wei-Lin Chiang, Yang Li, Si Si, Samy Bengio, Xuanqing Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

Integrating these into TTTLinear could enhance its adaptability during test-time training. A relevant reference is the work on Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks, which extends graph neural networks by incorporating gating mechanisms to capture complex structural relationships.\n\n### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n- GCNs are powerful for modeling data with inherent graph structures, capturing both local neighborhood information and global graph topology. Incorporating graph-inspired convolutions could allow TTTLinear to capture complex dependencies between tokens in a sequence. The work on Graph Attention Networks (GATs) is particularly relevant, as it leverages masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior graph convolution methods.\n\n## Combining Gating Mechanisms with GCNs\n\n- Previous works like GaAN (Gated Attention Networks) have successfully combined gating mechanisms with graph neural networks to enhance model expressiveness and efficiency. This approach could be adapted for TTTLinear to improve its capacity to model intricate dependency structures in language data.\n\n## Impact on Test-Time Training\n\n- The inclusion of gating mechanisms may improve the stability and convergence of the test-time training process by modulating updates to the hidden state. Graph convolutions could provide a richer context during test-time adaptations, enhancing robustness to variant or noisy inputs. The concept of learning to learn at test time, as discussed in the work on RNNs with expressive hidden states, is also relevant here.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n- Graph convolutions can be computationally intensive, especially for large graphs (long sequences). Efficient implementations or approximations, such as sparse graph representations or temporal snapshot graphs, may be necessary. The `GraphNeuralNetworks.jl` library provides various graph convolutional layers, including `GCNConv` and `GATv2Conv`, which support sparse operations and edge features, potentially improving CPU performance.\n\n## Novelty and Feasibility\n\n- While the integration of gating mechanisms and graph convolutions is explored in existing GNN literature, applying these specifically to enhance TTTLinear in autoregressive language models appears to be novel. Previous design proposals do not show an overlap with this specific combination.\n\n## Useful References\n\n- **Graph Attention Networks**: This work introduces GATs, which leverage masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior graph convolution methods.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently. Please see Tiezzi et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Naman Agarwal, Daniel Suo, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutional networks for long sequences*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. PRES: Toward Scalable Memory-Based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutional networks for long sequences*\n\n*Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Chuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Penguin: Parallel-Packed Homomorphic Encryption for Fast Graph Convolutional Network Inference\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutional networks for long sequences*\n\n*Ran Ran, Nuo Xu, Tao Liu, Wei Wang, Gang Quan, Wujie Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Penguin is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data, and is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data.\n\n**Abstract:** The marriage of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables the inference of graph data on the cloud with significantly enhanced client data privacy. However, the tremendous computation and memory overhead associated with HE operations challenges the practicality of HE-based GCN inference. GCN inference involves a sequence of expensive matrix-matrix multiplications, and we observe that directly applying the state-of-the-art HE-based secure matrix-matrix multiplication solutions to accelerate HE-GCN inference is far less efficient as it does not exploit the unique aggregation mechanism of two-dimension graph node-features in GCN layer computation. As a result, in this paper, we propose a novel HE-based ciphertext packing technique, i.e., Penguin , that can take advantage of the unique computation pattern during the HE-GCN inference to significantly reduce the computation and memory overhead associated with HE operations. Specifically, Penguin employs ( i ) an effective two-dimension parallel packing technique for feature ciphertext with optimal graph node partitioning and graph feature interleaving, and ( ii ) an interleaved assembly technique that can effectively make use of blank slots to merge ciphertexts after feature reduction and thus significantly reduce costly rotation operations. We perform detailed theoretical analysis to support our arguments. In the meantime, our experimental results also show that Penguin can achieve up to \u223c 10 \u00d7 speedup and around \u223c 79% reduction in computational memory overhead, significantly out-performing state-of-the-art solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data.

Pyramidal Recurrent Unit for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms in state space models*\n\n*Sachin Mehta, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Mohammad Rastegari, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Pyramidal Recurrent Unit (PRU) is introduced, which enables learning representations in high dimensional space with more generalization power and fewer parameters, and outperforms all previous RNN models that exploit different gating mechanisms and transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** LSTMs are powerful tools for modeling contextual information, as evidenced by their success at the task of language modeling. However, modeling contexts in very high dimensional space can lead to poor generalizability. We introduce the Pyramidal Recurrent Unit (PRU), which enables learning representations in high dimensional space with more generalization power and fewer parameters. PRUs replace the linear transformation in LSTMs with more sophisticated interactions such as pyramidal or grouped linear transformations. This architecture gives strong results on word-level language modeling while reducing parameters significantly. In particular, PRU improves the perplexity of a recent state-of-the-art language model by up to 1.3 points while learning 15-20% fewer parameters. For similar number of model parameters, PRU outperforms all previous RNN models that exploit different gating mechanisms and transformations. We provide a detailed examination of the PRU and its behavior on the language modeling tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms in state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 6. How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms in state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. Autoregressive Conditional Neural Processes\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training in autoregressive models*\n\n*W. Bruinsma, Stratis Markou, James Requiema, Andrew Y. K. Foong, Tom R. Andersson, Anna Vaughan, Anthony Buonomo, J. Hosking, Richard E. Turner*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work autoregressively defines a joint predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration from the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) literature, and shows that this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly dependent, non-Gaussian predictive distributions.\n\n**Abstract:** Conditional neural processes (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018a) are attractive meta-learning models which produce well-calibrated predictions and are trainable via a simple maximum likelihood procedure. Although CNPs have many advantages, they are unable to model dependencies in their predictions. Various works propose solutions to this, but these come at the cost of either requiring approximate inference or being limited to Gaussian predictions. In this work, we instead propose to change how CNPs are deployed at test time, without any modifications to the model or training procedure. Instead of making predictions independently for every target point, we autoregressively define a joint predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration from the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) literature. We show that this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly dependent, non-Gaussian predictive distributions. Perhaps surprisingly, in an extensive range of tasks with synthetic and real data, we show that CNPs in autoregressive (AR) mode not only significantly outperform non-AR CNPs, but are also competitive with more sophisticated models that are significantly more computationally expensive and challenging to train. This performance is remarkable given that AR CNPs are not trained to model joint dependencies. Our work provides an example of how ideas from neural distribution estimation can benefit neural processes, and motivates research into the AR deployment of other neural process models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. Exposure Bias versus Self-Recovery: Are Distortions Really Incremental for Autoregressive Text Generation?\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training in autoregressive models*\n\n*Tianxing He, Jingzhao Zhang, Zhiming Zhou, James R. Glass*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on the task of open-ended language generation, proposes metrics to quantify the impact of exposure bias in the aspects of quality, diversity, and consistency, and reveals an interesting self-recovery ability of the LM, which is hypothesize to be countering the harmful effects from exposure bias.\n\n**Abstract:** Exposure bias has been regarded as a central problem for auto-regressive language models (LM). It claims that teacher forcing would cause the test-time generation to be incrementally distorted due to the training-generation discrepancy. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher forcing and therefore alleviate exposure bias, there is little work showing how serious the exposure bias problem actually is. In this work, we focus on the task of open-ended language generation, propose metrics to quantify the impact of exposure bias in the aspects of quality, diversity, and consistency. Our key intuition is that if we feed ground-truth data prefixes (instead of prefixes generated by the model itself) into the model and ask it to continue the generation, the performance should become much better because the training-generation discrepancy in the prefix is removed. Both automatic and human evaluations are conducted in our experiments. On the contrary to the popular belief in exposure bias, we find that the the distortion induced by the prefix discrepancy is limited, and does not seem to be incremental during the generation. Moreover, our analysis reveals an interesting self-recovery ability of the LM, which we hypothesize to be countering the harmful effects from exposure bias.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Emergent Agentic Transformer from Chain of Hindsight Experience\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training in autoregressive models*\n\n*Hao Liu, P. Abbeel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data, and shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models powered by diverse data and model scale have dominated natural language modeling and computer vision and pushed the frontier of multiple AI areas. In reinforcement learning (RL), despite many efforts into transformer-based policies, a key limitation, however, is that current transformer-based policies cannot learn by directly combining information from multiple sub-optimal trials. In this work, we address this issue using recently proposed chain of hindsight to relabel experience, where we train a transformer on a sequence of trajectory experience ascending sorted according to their total rewards. Our method consists of relabelling target return of each trajectory to the maximum total reward among in sequence of trajectories and training an autoregressive model to predict actions conditioning on past states, actions, rewards, target returns, and task completion tokens, the resulting model, Agentic Transformer (AT), can learn to improve upon itself both at training and test time. As we show on D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks, to the best our knowledge, this is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data. Our Agentic Transformer also shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Sequential Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutional networks for long sequences*\n\n*Yong Li, Depeng Jin, Yang song, Yanan Niu, Yiqun Hui, Yu Zheng, Chen Gao, Jianxin Chang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users' historical behaviors to predict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main challenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich historical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they cannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users' dynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult to capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we propose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential Recommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues. Specifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user behaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences into tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps explicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the interest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph convolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It dynamically fuses and extracts users' current activated core interests from noisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and proprietary industrial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further studies on sequence length confirm that our method can model long behavioral sequences effectively and efficiently.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms in state space models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Recurrent networks, which have enjoyed a modicum of success, still lack the generalization and systematicity ultimately required for modelling language. In this work, we propose an extension to the venerable Long Short-Term Memory in the form of mutual gating of the current input and the previous output. This mechanism affords the modelling of a richer space of interactions between inputs and their context. Equivalently, our model can be viewed as making the transition function given by the LSTM context-dependent. Experiments demonstrate markedly improved generalization on language modelling in the range of 3-4 perplexity points on Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2, and 0.01-0.05 bpc on four character-based datasets. We establish a new state of the art on all datasets with the exception of Enwik8, where we close a large gap between the LSTM and Transformer models.\n\n**Conference:** mogrifier-lstm-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-04\n\n\n\n#### 5. Autoregressive Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training in autoregressive models*\n\n*Tim Salimans, Rianne van den Berg, Ben Poole, Jasmijn Bastings, Alexey A. Gritsenko, Emiel Hoogeboom*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Autoregressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs), a model class encompassing and generalizing order-agnostic autoregressive models (Uria et al., 2014) and absorbing discrete diffusion (Austin et al., 2021), which we show are special cases of ARDMs under mild assumptions. ARDMs are simple to implement and easy to train. Unlike standard ARMs, they do not require causal masking of model representations, and can be trained using an efficient objective similar to modern probabilistic diffusion models that scales favourably to highly-dimensional data. At test time, ARDMs support parallel generation which can be adapted to fit any given generation budget. We find that ARDMs require significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to attain the same performance. Finally, we apply ARDMs to lossless compression, and show that they are uniquely suited to this task. Contrary to existing approaches based on bits-back coding, ARDMs obtain compelling results not only on complete datasets, but also on compressing single data points. Moreover, this can be done using a modest number of network calls for (de)compression due to the model's adaptable parallel generation.\n\n**Conference:** autoregressive-diffusion-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. Progressive Distillation for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training in autoregressive models*\n\n*Jonathan Ho, Tim Salimans*\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently shown great promise for generative modeling, outperforming GANs on perceptual quality and autoregressive models at density estimation. A remaining downside is their slow sampling time: generating high quality samples takes many hundreds or thousands of model evaluations. Here we make two contributions to help eliminate this downside: First, we present new parameterizations of diffusion models that provide increased stability when using few sampling steps. Second, we present a method to distill a trained deterministic diffusion sampler, using many steps, into a new diffusion model that takes half as many sampling steps. We then keep progressively applying this distillation procedure to our model, halving the number of required sampling steps each time. On standard image generation benchmarks like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and LSUN, we start out with state-of-the-art samplers taking as many as 8192 steps, and are able to distill down to models taking as few as 4 steps without losing much perceptual quality; achieving, for example, a FID of 3.0 on CIFAR-10 in 4 steps. Finally, we show that the full progressive distillation procedure does not take more time than it takes to train the original model, thus representing an efficient solution for generative modeling using diffusion at both train and test time.\n\n**Conference:** progressive-distillation-for-fast-sampling-of\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations, several key points and search directions need to be considered.\n\n### Key Aspects and Intentions\n\n1. **Novelty and Feasibility:**\n   - The researcher aims to determine if similar integrations of gating mechanisms and graph convolutions have been explored in the context of TTTLinear or related architectures.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

(2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutions for sequence models*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutions for sequence models*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolutions for Multigranular Topology Protection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutions for sequence models*\n\n*Eli Chien, Wei-Ning Chen, Chao Pan, Pan Li, Ayfer Ozgur, O. Milenkovic*\n\n**TL;DR:** The findings reveal that DP-GNNs not only fail to meet the requirements for multigranular graph topology privacy but also necessitate the injection of DP noise that scales at least linearly with the maximum node degree, and the proposed Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolutions (DPDGCs) represent a more flexible and efficient alternative to graph convolutions that still provides the necessary guarantees of GDP.\n\n**Abstract:** GNNs can inadvertently expose sensitive user information and interactions through their model predictions. To address these privacy concerns, Differential Privacy (DP) protocols are employed to control the trade-off between provable privacy protection and model utility. Applying standard DP approaches to GNNs directly is not advisable due to two main reasons. First, the prediction of node labels, which relies on neighboring node attributes through graph convolutions, can lead to privacy leakage. Second, in practical applications, the privacy requirements for node attributes and graph topology may differ. In the latter setting, existing DP-GNN models fail to provide multigranular trade-offs between graph topology privacy, node attribute privacy, and GNN utility. To address both limitations, we propose a new framework termed Graph Differential Privacy (GDP), specifically tailored to graph learning. GDP ensures both provably private model parameters as well as private predictions. Additionally, we describe a novel unified notion of graph dataset adjacency to analyze the properties of GDP for different levels of graph topology privacy. Our findings reveal that DP-GNNs, which rely on graph convolutions, not only fail to meet the requirements for multigranular graph topology privacy but also necessitate the injection of DP noise that scales at least linearly with the maximum node degree. In contrast, our proposed Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolutions (DPDGCs) represent a more flexible and efficient alternative to graph convolutions that still provides the necessary guarantees of GDP. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on seven node classification benchmarking and illustrative synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that DPDGCs significantly outperform existing DP-GNNs in terms of privacy-utility trade-offs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Pi-DUAL: Using Privileged Information to Distinguish Clean from Noisy Labels\n\n*From Search Query: integrating gating mechanisms in test-time training*\n\n*Ke Wang, Guillermo Ortiz-Jim\u00e9nez, Rodolphe Jenatton, Mark Collier, Efi Kokiopoulou, Pascal Frossard*\n\n**TL;DR:** Pi-DUAL is an architecture designed to harness PI to distinguish clean from wrong labels, and is a simple, scalable and practical approach for mitigating the effects of label noise in a variety of real-world scenarios with PI.\n\n**Abstract:** Label noise is a pervasive problem in deep learning that often compromises the generalization performance of trained models. Recently, leveraging privileged information (PI) -- information available only during training but not at test time -- has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate this issue. Yet, existing PI-based methods have failed to consistently outperform their no-PI counterparts in terms of preventing overfitting to label noise. To address this deficiency, we introduce Pi-DUAL, an architecture designed to harness PI to distinguish clean from wrong labels. Pi-DUAL decomposes the output logits into a prediction term, based on conventional input features, and a noise-fitting term influenced solely by PI. A gating mechanism steered by PI adaptively shifts focus between these terms, allowing the model to implicitly separate the learning paths of clean and wrong labels. Empirically, Pi-DUAL achieves significant performance improvements on key PI benchmarks (e.g., +6.8% on ImageNet-PI), establishing a new state-of-the-art test set accuracy. Additionally, Pi-DUAL is a potent method for identifying noisy samples post-training, outperforming other strong methods at this task. Overall, Pi-DUAL is a simple, scalable and practical approach for mitigating the effects of label noise in a variety of real-world scenarios with PI.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Adaptive recurrent vision performs zero-shot computation scaling to unseen difficulty levels\n\n*From Search Query: integrating gating mechanisms in test-time training*\n\n*Vijay Veerabadran, Srinivas Ravishankar, Yuan Tang, Ritik Raina, Virginia R. de Sa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study provides modeling evidence supporting the hypothesis that recurrent processing enables the functional advantage of adaptively allocating compute resources conditional on input requirements and hence allowing generalization to harder difficulty levels of a visual reasoning problem without training.\n\n**Abstract:** Humans solving algorithmic (or) reasoning problems typically exhibit solution times that grow as a function of problem difficulty. Adaptive recurrent neural networks have been shown to exhibit this property for various language-processing tasks. However, little work has been performed to assess whether such adaptive computation can also enable vision models to extrapolate solutions beyond their training distribution's difficulty level, with prior work focusing on very simple tasks. In this study, we investigate a critical functional role of such adaptive processing using recurrent neural networks: to dynamically scale computational resources conditional on input requirements that allow for zero-shot generalization to novel difficulty levels not seen during training using two challenging visual reasoning tasks: PathFinder and Mazes. We combine convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) with a learnable halting mechanism based on Graves (2016). We explore various implementations of such adaptive ConvRNNs (AdRNNs) ranging from tying weights across layers to more sophisticated biologically inspired recurrent networks that possess lateral connections and gating. We show that 1) AdRNNs learn to dynamically halt processing early (or late) to solve easier (or harder) problems, 2) these RNNs zero-shot generalize to more difficult problem settings not shown during training by dynamically increasing the number of recurrent iterations at test time. Our study provides modeling evidence supporting the hypothesis that recurrent processing enables the functional advantage of adaptively allocating compute resources conditional on input requirements and hence allowing generalization to harder difficulty levels of a visual reasoning problem without training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Zemel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.\n\n**Abstract:** Abstract: Graph-structured data appears frequently in domains including chemistry, natural language semantics, social networks, and knowledge bases. In this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 3109  (*Influential: 370*)\n\n#### 7. Recurrent Space-time Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph-based recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Andrei Liviu Nicolicioiu, Iulia Duta, Marius Leordeanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a neural graph model, recurrent in space and time, suitable for capturing both the local appearance and the complex higher-level interactions of different entities and objects within the changing world scene and obtains state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Something-Something human-object interaction dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning in the space-time domain remains a very challenging problem in machine learning and computer vision. Current computational models for understanding spatio-temporal visual data are heavily rooted in the classical single-image based paradigm. It is not yet well understood how to integrate information in space and time into a single, general model. We propose a neural graph model, recurrent in space and time, suitable for capturing both the local appearance and the complex higher-level interactions of different entities and objects within the changing world scene. Nodes and edges in our graph have dedicated neural networks for processing information. Nodes operate over features extracted from local parts in space and time and previous memory states. Edges process messages between connected nodes at different locations and spatial scales or between past and present time. Messages are passed iteratively in order to transmit information globally and establish long range interactions. Our model is general and could learn to recognize a variety of high level spatio-temporal concepts and be applied to different learning tasks. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments and ablation studies, that our model outperforms strong baselines and top published methods on recognizing complex activities in video. Moreover, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Something-Something human-object interaction dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 44  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. Generalization and Representational Limits of Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph-based recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Vikas K. Garg, S. Jegelka, T. Jaakkola*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proves that several important graph properties cannot be computed by GNNs that rely entirely on local information, and provides the first data dependent generalization bounds for message passing Gnns.\n\n**Abstract:** We address two fundamental questions about graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we prove that several important graph properties cannot be computed by GNNs that rely entirely on local information. Such GNNs include the standard message passing models, and more powerful spatial variants that exploit local graph structure (e.g., via relative orientation of messages, or local port ordering) to distinguish neighbors of each node. Our treatment includes a novel graph-theoretic formalism. Second, we provide the first data dependent generalization bounds for message passing GNNs. This analysis explicitly accounts for the local permutation invariance of GNNs. Our bounds are much tighter than existing VC-dimension based guarantees for GNNs, and are comparable to Rademacher bounds for recurrent neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 276  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. CNTK: Microsoft's Open-Source Deep-Learning Toolkit\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolutions for sequence models*\n\n*Frank Seide, Amit Agarwal*\n\n**Abstract:** This tutorial will introduce the Computational Network Toolkit, or CNTK, Microsoft's cutting-edge open-source deep-learning toolkit for Windows and Linux. CNTK is a powerful computation-graph based deep-learning toolkit for training and evaluating deep neural networks. Microsoft product groups use CNTK, for example to create the Cortana speech models and web ranking. CNTK supports feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks for speech, image, and text workloads, also in combination. Popular network types are supported either natively (convolution) or can be described as a CNTK configuration (LSTM, sequence-to-sequence). CNTK scales to multiple GPU servers and is designed around efficiency. The tutorial will give an overview of CNTK's general architecture and describe the specific methods and algorithms used for automatic differentiation, recurrent-loop inference and execution, memory sharing, on-the-fly randomization of large corpora, and multi-server parallelization. We will then show how typical uses looks like for relevant tasks like image recognition, sequence-to-sequence modeling, and speech recognition.\n\n**Proceeding:** acm-sigkdd-2016-8\n\n**Published:** 2016-08-01\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Graph-Partitioning-Based Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for Large-Scale Traffic Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: graph-based recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Tanwi Mallick, Jane Macfarlane, Eric Rask, Prasanna Balaprakash*\n\n**Abstract:** Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for mobility. Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting on large highway networks a challenging task. Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks (DCRNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, however, applying DCRNNs for large highway networks still remains elusive because of computational and memory bottlenecks. We present an approach for implementing a DCRNN for a large highway network that overcomes these limitations. Our approach uses a graph-partitioning method to decompose a large highway network into smaller networks and trains them independently. We demonstrate the efficacy of the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN approach to model the traffic on a large California highway network with 11,160 sensor locations. We develop an overlapping nodes approach for the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN to include sensor locations from partitions that are geographically close to a given partition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DCRNN model can be used to forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and that the forecasted values preserve fundamental traffic flow dynamics. Our approach to developing DCRNN models that represent large highway networks can be a potential core capability in advanced highway traffic monitoring systems, where a trained DCRNN model forecasting traffic at all sensor locations can be used to adjust traffic management strategies proactively based on anticipated future conditions.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design and evaluate a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations to enhance the performance of the existing TTTLinear GAU (Generalized Autoregressive Unit) during test-time training.

Among these GAUs, TTTLinear has demonstrated robust performance by integrating test-time training mechanisms. However, TTTLinear, while efficient, predominantly captures local dependencies and may not fully leverage global contextual information essential for complex language understanding tasks. The primary motivation of this proposal is to augment the TTTLinear GAU with gated mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations, thereby enhancing its capacity to dynamically adapt during test-time training. This augmentation aims to capture both local and global dependencies more effectively, ultimately improving model perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and computational efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\nSeveral advancements have been made in refining convolutional and attention-based models to better capture dependencies in sequence modeling:\n\n1. **Adaptive and Dynamic Convolutional Filters**: The integration of dynamic filter generation, as seen in Seq-U-Net [Internal Ref: 1], allows convolutional layers to adapt filters based on input sequences, enhancing context-dependent feature extraction.\n\n2. **Graph-Inspired Convolutional Architectures**: MixHop and Graph Metanetworks [External Ref: 4, 5] demonstrate how graph-based convolutions can capture complex relational dependencies, which can inspire more structured dependency modeling in GAUs.\n\n3. **Hybrid Attention-Convolution Mechanisms**: CoAtNet and MOAT [External Ref: 7, 9] showcase the benefits of combining attention mechanisms with convolutional operations, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance feature representation and efficiency.\n\n4. **State Space Models Integration**: MambaMixer and Convolutional State Space Models [Internal Ref: 3, 4] merge state space models with convolutional architectures, balancing computational efficiency and long-range dependency modeling.\n\n5. **Gating Mechanisms**: Studies on gated recurrent units and their enhancements highlight the importance of gating mechanisms in controlling information flow, as seen in the gated linear attention formulations [External Ref: 2, 10].\n\nThese related works collectively underscore the potential of integrating advanced convolutional techniques and gating mechanisms to enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of GAUs.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe TTTLinear GAU excels in test-time training by maintaining an expressive hidden state updated through linear transformations. However, its current design has limitations in capturing extensive global dependencies, which are crucial for understanding complex linguistic structures and long-context dependencies.\n\n**Key Challenges:**\n\n1. **Local Dependency Dominance**: TTTLinear, in its current form, primarily focuses on local dependencies due to the linear nature of its transformations, limiting its effectiveness in tasks requiring global context.\n2. **Limited Adaptability**: While test-time training introduces adaptability, TTTLinear lacks mechanisms to modulate the degree of adaptation based on the input sequence's complexity or dependency patterns.\n3. **Computational Overhead**: Enhancing TTTLinear with additional mechanisms must be balanced against the need for computational efficiency to maintain scalability with larger models and longer sequences.\n\n**Mathematical Perspective:**\n\nLet \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) represent the input embeddings, \\( Z \\) be intermediate variables, and \\( \\theta \\) denote the GAU parameters. The TTTLinear GAU processes input as:\n\\[\nY = \\text{TTTLinear}(X, Z; \\theta) = XW + b\n\\]\nwhere \\( W \\) and \\( b \\) are learned linear transformations.\n\nTo enhance global dependency capture and adaptability, we propose:\n\\[\nY = \\text{GatedTTTLinear}(X, Z; \\theta) = \\sigma(XW_g + b_g) \\odot (XW + b)\n\\]\nwhere \\( W_g \\) and \\( b_g \\) are parameters for gating mechanisms, \\( \\sigma \\) is a sigmoid activation, and \\( \\odot \\) denotes element-wise multiplication. Additionally, integrating graph-inspired convolutions can be modeled as:\n\\[\nY = \\text{GraphConv}(Y)\n\\]\ncapturing relational dependencies beyond linear transformations.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\n- **Parameter Efficiency vs. Expressiveness**: Introducing gating and graph convolutions increases model parameters but offers enhanced expressive power to capture complex dependencies.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Efficient implementation strategies are required to prevent significant computational overheads, ensuring scalability.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selection of GAU to Modify\n\n```selection TTTLinear```\n\n### Proposed Modifications\n\n1. **Integration of Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - **Learnable Gates**: Introduce learnable gating mechanisms that control the flow of information based on the input sequence's context, allowing dynamic adjustment of the adaptation process during test-time training.\n   - **Sigmoid Activation**: Utilize sigmoid activation functions to modulate the gate's influence seamlessly within the GAU computations.\n   \n2. **Incorporation of Graph-Inspired Convolutions**:\n   - **Graph Convolution Layer**: Embed a graph convolutional layer within the TTTLinear GAU to capture global relational dependencies among tokens. This layer will process the output of the gated linear transformations, integrating structured relational information.\n   - **Adjacency Matrix Learning**: Learn or infer an adjacency matrix that defines the token relationships dynamically, enabling the graph convolution layer to adapt based on the input sequence.\n   \n3. **Adaptive Test-Time Training**:\n   - **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment**: Implement mechanisms to dynamically adjust the learning rate during test-time training based on the input sequence's dependency patterns, enhancing adaptability.\n   - **Selective Parameter Updates**: Incorporate selective updates of GAU parameters, guided by gating mechanisms, to focus adaptation efforts on relevant aspects of the input sequence.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Gated Linear Transformation**:\n\\[\nG = \\sigma(XW_g + b_g) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D}\n\\]\n\\[\nY_{\\text{gated}} = G \\odot (XW + b)\n\\]\nwhere \\( W_g \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times D} \\) and \\( b_g \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D} \\).\n\n2. **Graph-Convolutional Processing**:\n\\[\nA = f(X;

This augmentation allows the GAU to dynamically adapt during test-time training, effectively capturing both local and global dependencies within input sequences. The introduction of a graph convolutional layer facilitates the modeling of complex relational dependencies, while the gating mechanism ensures efficient and context-dependent information flow. These modifications are expected to lead to improvements in model perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and computational efficiency. By leveraging insights from adaptive convolutions and graph neural networks, GatedTTTLinear represents a significant advancement in GAU design, positioning it as a competitive architecture in modern autoregressive language models.\n\n## References\n\n1.
