In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we explore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated attention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training (PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\em Transient Global} (TGlobal), which mimics ETC's local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on question answering tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/23 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nLesly Miculicich, Dhananjay Ram, Nikolaos Pappas, and James Henderson. 2018.

Score: 0.90)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/50 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nISSN 0019-9958.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Score: 0.86)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2021)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations of traditional RvNNs by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs), which compose sequences according to their underlying hierarchical syntactic structure, have performed well in several natural language processing tasks compared to similar models without structural biases. However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent structure in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to rely on surrogate gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher bias or variance. In this work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations. This is done by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves strong performance in challenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference and ListOps. We also show that CRvNN performs comparably or better than prior latent structure models on real-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/40 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nC. and Das, S.

AMR Parsing with Causal Hierarchical Attention and Pointers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Chao Lou, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model is introduced, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder, and which outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Abstract:** Translation-based AMR parsers have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dior-CVAE: Pre-trained Language Models and Diffusion Priors for Variational Dialog Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Tianyu Yang, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work employs a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM, and proposes memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Current variational dialog models have employed pre-trained language models (PLMs) to parameterize the likelihood and posterior distributions. However, the Gaussian assumption made on the prior distribution is incompatible with these distributions, thus restricting the diversity of generated responses. These models also suffer from posterior collapse, i.e., the decoder tends to ignore latent variables and directly access information captured in the encoder through the cross-attention mechanism. In this work, we propose Dior-CVAE, a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with diffusion priors to address these challenges. We employ a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM. Also, we propose memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation. Overall, experiments across two commonly used open-domain dialog datasets show that our method can generate more diverse responses without large-scale dialog pre-training.

In this paper, we propose a new task of code documentation generation (CDG) for computational notebooks. In contrast to the previous CDG tasks which focus on generating documentation for single code snippets, in a computational notebook, one documentation in a markdown cell often corresponds to multiple code cells, and these code cells have an inherent structure. We proposed a new model (HAConvGNN) that uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to consider the relevant code cells and the relevant code tokens information when generating the documentation. Tested on a new corpus constructed from well-documented Kaggle notebooks, we show that our model outperforms other baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored so far is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties that would naturally combine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 3048  (*Influential: 425*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

SOWA: Adapting Hierarchical Frozen Window Self-Attention to Visual-Language Models for Better Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Zhaosheng Zhang, Zongxiang Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Visual anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing, but traditional methods often rely on extensive normal datasets and custom models, limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language models have significantly improved zero/few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully utilize hierarchical features, potentially missing nuanced details. We introduce a window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, combined with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Offier Window self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been tested on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Ordered Neurons: Integrating Tree Structures into Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured neural networks*\n\n*Alessandro Sordoni, Yikang Shen, Shawn Tan, Aaron Courville*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural language is hierarchically structured: smaller units (e.g., phrases) are nested within larger units (e.g., clauses). When a larger constituent ends, all of the smaller constituents that are nested within it must also be closed. While the standard LSTM architecture allows different neurons to track information at different time scales, it does not have an explicit bias towards modeling a hierarchy of constituents. This paper proposes to add such an inductive bias by ordering the neurons; a vector of master input and forget gates ensures that when a given neuron is updated, all the neurons that follow it in the ordering are also updated. Our novel recurrent architecture, ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM), achieves good performance on four different tasks: language modeling, unsupervised parsing, targeted syntactic evaluation, and logical inference.\n\n**Conference:** ordered-neurons-integrating-tree-structures-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-22\n\n\n\n#### 4. Rumor Detection on Twitter with Tree-structured Recursive Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured neural networks*\n\n*Kam-Fai Wong, Wei Gao, Jing Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic rumor detection is technically very challenging. In this work, we try to learn discriminative features from tweets content by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying different type of rumors. We propose two recursive neural models based on a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured neural networks for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the propagation layout of tweets. Results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate that our recursive neural models 1) achieve much better performance than state-of-the-art approaches; 2) demonstrate superior capacity on detecting rumors at very early stage.\n\n**Proceeding:** acl-2018-7\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hierarchical extensions to attention mechanisms and tree-structured approaches, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Nova: Hierarchical Attention for Assembly Code\nThe paper on Nova introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism specifically designed for assembly code. This mechanism captures semantics at three granularity levels:\n- **Intra-instruction attention**: Captures the instruction summary.\n- **Preceding-instruction attention**: Captures the context with the preceding instruction.\n- **Inter-instruction attention**: Learns long dependencies across instructions using \u201c[INST]\u201d labels that contain instruction summaries.\n\nThis hierarchical approach can be adapted to other domains by breaking down the input into different levels of abstraction, similar to how Nova handles assembly code.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN)\nThe Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) is another example that has been successfully applied in natural language processing tasks, such as long document classification. HAN aggregates information at multiple levels of granularity, focusing on different parts of the input text at varying levels of abstraction. This approach enhances the ability to handle long and complex documents by capturing dependencies within and across sentences.\n\n### InterACT: Hierarchical Attention for Bimanual Robotics\nThe InterACT model uses hierarchical attention to capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm joint states and visual inputs in bimanual manipulation tasks. The Hierarchical Attention Encoder processes input segments and captures both intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies, which can be a valuable inspiration for handling complex and long-range dependencies in language models.\n\n## Tree-Structured Computation in Neural Networks\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-label Text Classification\nWhile not directly focused on language models, the Hierarchical Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for multi-label text classification provides insights into hierarchical processing. HARNN uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to classify documents into multiple labels, which involves processing the document structure in a hierarchical manner. This approach can be adapted to tree-structured neural networks for language models by organizing the input data into a hierarchical structure and processing it accordingly.\n\n### CAST, PA-former, and HierarchyNet\nThese models, although designed for source code analysis, use tree-structured approaches that can be inspirational for language models. For example:\n- **CAST** splits the abstract syntax tree (AST) of source code into subtrees, encodes the subtrees, and aggregates them to the final encoding.\n- **PA-former** constructs source code as pyramid input based on their AST structure and uses a pyramid attention mechanism.\n- **HierarchyNet** considers source code AST, data flow, and control flow graphs.\n\nThese tree-structured approaches can be adapted to language models by organizing the input data into hierarchical structures such as parse trees or syntactic trees and processing them using hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Organization in Language Models\n\n### RetNet and Compositional Attention\nThe analysis note mentions RetNet and compositional attention, which are relevant to improving memory organization and attention/retention mechanisms in language models. RetNet's retention mechanism supports multiple computation paradigms (parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent) and can be enhanced with hierarchical structure to better handle temporal information and long-range dependencies. Compositional attention mechanisms can be integrated to improve feature interaction and dynamic context-dependent processing[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these concepts, researchers can design language models that:\n- Use hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture semantics at multiple levels of granularity.\n- Employ tree-structured computation to organize and process input data efficiently.\n- Optimize memory usage and retention mechanisms to handle long-range dependencies and improve overall performance.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving better performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 255  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale and enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 2. Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention (Avg.

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1910.06611, 2019.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.55)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03961, 2021.

Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, Lukasz Kaiser*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2018)\t**Cited by** 673  (*Influential: 65*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses issues of parallelizability and global receptive field, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/32 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02357, 2016.

Fergus*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural network with a recurrent attention model over a possibly large external memory that is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a neural network with a recurrent attention model over a possibly large external memory. The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 2481  (*Influential: 264*)\n\n#### 2.

The MN-GMN uses graph structure with different region features as node attributes and applies a recently proposed powerful graph neural network model, Graph Network (GN), to reason about objects and their interactions in an image. The input module of the MN-GMN generates a set of visual features plus a set of encoded region-grounded captions (RGCs) for the image. The RGCs capture object attributes and their relationships. Two GNs are constructed from the input module using the visual features and encoded RGCs. Each node of the GNs iteratively computes a question-guided contextualized representation of the visual/textual information assigned to it. Then, to combine the information from both GNs, the nodes write the updated representations to an external spatial memory. The final states of the memory cells are fed into an answer module to predict an answer. Experiments show MN-GMN rivals the state-of-the-art models on Visual7W, VQA-v2.0, and CLEVR datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Multigrid Neural Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory organization*\n\n*T. Huynh, M. Maire, Matthew R. Walter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory, which functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results on tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory. Distinct from strategies that connect neural networks to external memory banks via intricately crafted controllers and hand-designed attentional mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed, co-located alongside computation, and implicitly addressed, while being drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting networks with multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories, while multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully connected networks. Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these capabilities on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, and question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory organization*\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6. Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory organization*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Bidirectional Quaternion Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks for Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: neural memory networks*\n\n*Renato de Mori, Georges Linar\u00e8s, Mohamed Morchid, Titouan Parcollet*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are at the core of modern automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems. In particular, long-short term memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in many speech\nrecognition tasks, due to their efficient representation of long and short term\ndependencies in sequences of inter-dependent features. Nonetheless, internal\ndependencies within the element composing multidimensional features are weakly\nconsidered by traditional real-valued representations. We propose a novel\nquaternion long-short term memory (QLSTM) recurrent neural network that takes\ninto account both the external relations between the features composing a\nsequence, and these internal latent structural dependencies with the quaternion\nalgebra. QLSTMs are compared to LSTMs during a memory copy-task and a realistic\napplication of speech recognition on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset.\nQLSTM reaches better performances during the two experiments with up to $2.8$\ntimes less learning parameters, leading to a more expressive representation of\nthe information.\n\n**Published:** 2018-11-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural memory networks*\n\n*Olga Russakovsky, Zhiwei Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

Towards an Arrow-native Storage System\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory organization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-increasing dataset sizes, several file formats like Parquet, ORC, and Avro have been developed to store data efficiently and to save network and interconnect bandwidth at the price of additional CPU utilization. However, with the advent of networks supporting 25-100 Gb/s and storage devices delivering 1, 000, 000 reqs/sec the CPU has become the bottleneck, trying to keep up feeding data in and out of these fast devices. The result is that data access libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot utilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive solution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering tasks to the storage layer. However, modifying legacy storage systems to support compute offloading is often tedious and requires extensive understanding of the internals. Previous approaches re-implemented functionality of data processing frameworks and access library for a particular storage system, a duplication of effort that might have to be repeated for different storage systems. In this paper, we introduce a new design paradigm that allows extending programmable object storage systems to embed existing, widely used data processing frameworks and access libraries into the storage layer with minimal modifications. In this approach data processing frameworks and access libraries can evolve independently from storage systems while leveraging the scale-out and availability properties of distributed storage systems. We present one example implementation of our design paradigm using Ceph, Apache Arrow, and Parquet. We provide a brief performance evaluation of our implementation and discuss key results.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. BRAU-Net++: U-Shaped Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory organization*\n\n*Yudong Zhang, Yongmei Li, Xiaojuan Liu, Lu Jiang, Pengzhou Cai, Libin Lan*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical quantification, disease diagnosis, treatment planning and many other applications. Both convolution-based and transformer-based u-shaped architectures have made significant success in various medical image segmentation tasks. The former can efficiently learn local information of images while requiring much more image-specific inductive biases inherent to convolution operation. The latter can effectively capture long-range dependency at different feature scales using self-attention, whereas it typically encounters the challenges of quadratic compute and memory requirements with sequence length increasing. To address this problem, through integrating the merits of these two paradigms in a well-designed u-shaped architecture, we propose a hybrid yet effective CNN-Transformer network, named BRAU-Net++, for an accurate medical image segmentation task. Specifically, BRAU-Net++ uses bi-level routing attention as the core building block to design our u-shaped encoder-decoder structure, in which both encoder and decoder are hierarchically constructed, so as to learn global semantic information while reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, this network restructures skip connection by incorporating channel-spatial attention which adopts convolution operations, aiming to minimize local spatial information loss and amplify global dimension-interaction of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses other state-of-the-art methods including its baseline: BRAU-Net under almost all evaluation metrics. We achieve the average Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 82.47, 90.10, and 92.94 on Synapse multi-organ segmentation, ISIC-2018 Challenge, and CVC-ClinicDB, as well as the mIoU of 84.01 and 88.17 on ISIC-2018 Challenge and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on hierarchical memory organization, efficient memory access patterns, integration of memory with attention mechanisms, and novel retention mechanisms for sequential data, here are some key insights and references:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Organization\n\n- **Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (HRNNs)**: These networks connect neurons in various ways to decompose hierarchical behavior into useful subprograms. HRNNs are particularly useful in forecasting and can leverage information from higher levels to enhance lower-level predictions, demonstrating superior performance in tasks like inflation prediction.\n- **Multiple Timescales Recurrent Neural Networks (MTRNNs)**: These models simulate the functional hierarchy of the brain by segmenting continuous sequences into reusable primitives. This hierarchical structure allows for flexible integration of sequential behaviors and aligns with theories of memory by philosophers like Henri Bergson.\n\n## Efficient Memory Access Patterns\n\n- **Neural History Compressor**: This architecture involves a hierarchy of RNNs where each higher level RNN compresses the information from the lower level, minimizing the description length of the data. This approach ensures that only unpredictable inputs are passed to higher levels, making the system efficient in handling long sequences with sparse important events.\n- **Hierarchical Associative Memory Networks**: These networks organize neurons in layers with different activation functions and time scales. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient memory access and retrieval, particularly useful in applications requiring pattern completion and separation.\n\n## Integration of Memory with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Tree-Structured Neural Networks**: Models like Tree-LSTMs integrate hierarchical processing with attention mechanisms. These models outperform traditional LSTMs by capturing hierarchical relationships naturally, which can be beneficial for integrating memory and attention in autoregressive models.\n- **H-Transformer-1D**: This model exploits a hierarchical matrix structure to achieve linear runtime and memory complexity. It integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms, which can be adapted to improve the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive models.\n\n## Novel Retention Mechanisms for Sequential Data\n\n- **Ordered Neurons**: This approach integrates tree structures into RNNs by ensuring that when a neuron is updated, all subsequent neurons in the ordering are also updated. This method can enhance the retention mechanism by maintaining a structured update process, which is crucial for handling sequential data.\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: These can be organized at multiple levels (token, phrase, sequence) to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. This hierarchical attention can complement the retention mechanism in autoregressive models, improving their ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory Capacity and Heterogeneity**: Research on neural networks suggests that maximizing memory capacity involves a hierarchical indexing scheme, where layers with more neurons store higher-order indices. This approach supports both pattern completion and separation, which is crucial for efficient memory access and retention in sequential data.\n- **Combination of Sequential and Hierarchical Processing**: Integrating tree-structured computation with sequential processing can enhance the scalability and efficiency of autoregressive models. This combination allows for better handling of long-range dependencies and more efficient memory usage.\n\nBy incorporating these hierarchical memory organizations, efficient memory access patterns, and novel retention mechanisms, researchers can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models, enhancing their performance, scalability, and efficiency.\n",

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/50 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nWe also report competitive results on enwik-8 ( 0.99 vs 0.98 perplexity) and present ablations on CIFAR-10. ## 2 Related Work\n\nAttention with Temporal Sparsity: Research on efficient attention neural models parallels the advent of attention-based architectures. In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural computation*\n\n*Song Han, Jeff Pool, J. Tran, W. Dally*\n\n**TL;DR:** A method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections, and prunes redundant connections using a three-step method.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9x, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the number of parameters can be reduced by 13x, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 6128  (*Influential: 669*)\n\n#### 2. AutoMoE: Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts with Adaptive Computation for Efficient Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural computation*\n\n*Ganesh Jawahar, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Xiaodong Liu, Young Jin Kim, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, L. Lakshmanan, A. Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

PreNAS: Preferred One-Shot Learning Towards Efficient Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural computation*\n\n*Haibin Wang, Ce Ge, Hesen Chen, Xiuyu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** PreNAS is presented, a search-free NAS approach that accentuates target models in one-shot training that enables instant specialization with zero search cost and dramatically reduces sample space by a zero-cost selector.\n\n**Abstract:** The wide application of pre-trained models is driving the trend of once-for-all training in one-shot neural architecture search (NAS). However, training within a huge sample space damages the performance of individual subnets and requires much computation to search for an optimal model. In this paper, we present PreNAS, a search-free NAS approach that accentuates target models in one-shot training. Specifically, the sample space is dramatically reduced in advance by a zero-cost selector, and weight-sharing one-shot training is performed on the preferred architectures to alleviate update conflicts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PreNAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot NAS competitors for both Vision Transformer and convolutional architectures, and importantly, enables instant specialization with zero search cost.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors of macaque monkeys can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent discoveries indicate that the neural codes in the super\ufb01cial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys are complex, diverse and super-sparse. This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. SPECTRA: Sparse Structured Text Rationalization\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, Andr\u00e9 F. T.

SqueezeBERT: What can computer vision teach NLP about efficient neural networks?\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural computation*\n\n*Forrest N. Iandola, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer, Albert E. Shaw*\n\n**Abstract:** Humans read and write hundreds of billions of messages every day. Further, due to the availability of large datasets, large computing systems, and better neural network models, natural language processing (NLP) technology has made significant strides in understanding, proofreading, and organizing these messages. Thus, there is a significant opportunity to deploy NLP in myriad applications to help web users, social networks, and businesses. In particular, we consider smartphones and other mobile devices as crucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today's highly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with BERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods such as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these techniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in self-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called SqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test set. The SqueezeBERT code will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-sustainlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-19\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We propose in this paper a\nnew framework for sparse and structured attention, building upon a smoothed max\noperator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from\nreal values to probabilities, suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework\nincludes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax\nas special cases. However, we also show how our framework can incorporate\nmodern structured penalties, resulting in more interpretable attention\nmechanisms, that focus on entire segments or groups of an input. We derive\nefficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our\nattention mechanisms, enabling their use in a neural network trained with\nbackpropagation. To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for\nexisting ones, we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks:\ntextual entailment, machine translation, and sentence summarization. Our\nattention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance;\nnotably, on textual entailment and summarization, we outperform the standard\nattention mechanisms based on softmax and sparsemax.\n\n**Conference:** a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on computational efficiency, sparse computation techniques, efficient attention variants, and memory-efficient neural architectures, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Sparse Computation Techniques\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Implementing sparse attention can significantly reduce computational demands by focusing only on the most relevant tokens or features.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/68 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nURL http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06265.

We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective. As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using a simple modification that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 53/92 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the ACL-PASCAL workshop on textual entailment and paraphrasing, pages 1-9.

Adaptive Computation with Elastic Input Sequence\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation neural networks*\n\n*Fuzhao Xue, Valerii Likhosherstov, Anurag Arnab, N. Houlsby, Mostafa Dehghani, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens, and adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data.\n\n**Abstract:** Humans have the ability to adapt the type of information they use, the procedure they employ, and the amount of time they spend when solving problems. However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost.

Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation neural networks*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Parameter Efficient Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse networks*\n\n*H. Mostafa, Xin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network, and outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks are typically highly overparameterized. Pruning techniques are able to remove a significant fraction of network parameters with little loss in accuracy. Recently, techniques based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters have emerged, allowing direct training of sparse networks without having to pre-train a large dense model. Here we present a novel dynamic sparse reparameterization method that addresses the limitations of previous techniques such as high computational cost and the need for manual configuration of the number of free parameters allocated to each layer. We evaluate the performance of dynamic reallocation methods in training deep convolutional networks and show that our method outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget, on par with accuracies obtained by iteratively pruning a pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters were sufficient to explain the superior performance. Rather, effective learning crucially depended on the continuous exploration of the sparse network structure space during training. Our work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 286  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 5. State Transition of Dendritic Spines Improves Learning of Sparse Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse networks*\n\n*Yanqing Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Wei Fang, Zhengyu Ma, Tiejun Huang, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work organizes SNN pruning techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights, which yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered a promising alternative to Arti\ufb01cial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their event-driven computing paradigm when deployed on energy-ef\ufb01cient neuromorphic hardware. Recently, deep SNNs have shown breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and \ufb02exi-ble structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines in the \ufb01lopodial model of spinogen-esis, we model different states of SNN weights, facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet) while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss ( \u223c 3% at 88.8% sparsity) compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs. Moreover, we \ufb01nd out pruning speed regulation while learning is crucial to avoiding disastrous performance degradation at the \ufb01nal stages of training, which may shed light on future work on SNN pruning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Dynamic Sparse Graph for Efficient Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse networks*\n\n*L. Liu, Lei Deng, Xing Hu, Maohua Zhu, Guoqi Li, Yufei Ding, Yuan Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) with dynamic and sparse graph (DSG) structure for compressive memory and accelerative execution during both training and inference. The great success of DNNs motivates the pursuing of lightweight models for the deployment onto embedded devices. However, most of the previous studies optimize for inference while neglect training or even complicate it. Training is far more intractable, since (i) the neurons dominate the memory cost rather than the weights in inference; (ii) the dynamic activation makes previous sparse acceleration via one-off optimization on fixed weight invalid; (iii) batch normalization (BN) is critical for maintaining accuracy while its activation reorganization damages the sparsity. To address these issues, DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS). Experiments show significant memory saving (1.7-4.5x) and operation reduction (2.3-4.4x) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

A Case For Adaptive Deep Neural Networks in Edge Computing\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation neural networks*\n\n*Francis McNamee, Schahram Dustadar, Blesson Varghese, Weisong Shi, Peter Kilpatrick, Ivor Spence*\n\n**Abstract:** Edge computing offers an additional layer of compute infrastructure closer to the data source before raw data from privacy-sensitive and performance-critical applications is transferred to a cloud data center. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one class of applications that are reported to benefit from collaboratively computing between the edge and the cloud. A DNN is partitioned such that specific layers of the DNN are deployed onto the edge and the cloud to meet performance and privacy objectives. However, there is limited understanding of: (a) whether and how evolving operational conditions (increased CPU and memory utilization at the edge or reduced data transfer rates between the edge and the cloud) affect the performance of already deployed DNNs, and (b) whether a new partition configuration is required to maximize performance. A DNN that adapts to changing operational conditions is referred to as an 'adaptive DNN'. This paper investigates whether there is a case for adaptive DNNs in edge computing by considering three questions: (i) Are DNNs sensitive to operational conditions? (ii) How sensitive are DNNs to operational conditions? (iii) Do individual or a combination of operational conditions equally affect DNNs? (iv) Is DNN partitioning sensitive to hardware architectures on the cloud/edge? The exploration is carried out in the context of 8 pre-trained DNN models and the results presented are from analyzing nearly 8 million data points. The results highlight that network conditions affects DNN performance more than CPU or memory related operational conditions. Repartitioning is noted to provide a performance gain in a number of cases, but a specific trend was not noted in relation to its correlation to the underlying hardware architecture. Nonetheless, the need for adaptive DNNs is confirmed.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Compressing regularised dynamics improves link prediction in sparse networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Predicting future interactions or novel links in networks is an indispensable tool across diverse domains, including genetic research, online social networks, and recommendation systems. Among the numerous techniques developed for link prediction, those leveraging the networks' community structure have proven highly effective. For example, the recently proposed MapSim predicts links based on a similarity measure derived from the code structure of the map equation, a community-detection objective function that operates on network flows. However, the standard map equation assumes complete observations and typically identifies many small modules in networks where the nodes connect through only a few links. This aspect can degrade MapSim's performance on sparse networks. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate a global regularisation method based on a Bayesian estimate of the transition rates along with three local regularisation methods. The regularised versions of the map equation compensate for incomplete observations and decrease the number of identified communities in sparse networks. The regularised methods outperform standard MapSim and several state-of-the-art embedding methods in highly sparse networks. This performance holds across multiple real-world networks with randomly removed links, simulating incomplete observations. Among the proposed regularisation methods, the global regularisation method provides the most reliable community detection and the highest link prediction performance across different network densities.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Physics-aware Difference Graph Networks for Sparsely-Observed Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse networks*\n\n*Chuizheng Meng*, Sungyong Seo*, Yan Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely available data points cause a numerical error on finite differences which hinder to modeling the dynamics of physical systems. The discretization error becomes even larger when the sparse data are irregularly distributed so that the data defined on an unstructured grid, making it hard to build deep learning models to handle physics-governing observations on the unstructured grid. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Physics-aware Difference Graph Networks (PA-DGN) that exploits neighboring information to learn finite differences inspired by physics equations. PA-DGN further leverages data-driven end-to-end learning to discover underlying dynamical relations between the spatial and temporal differences in given observations. We demonstrate the superiority of PA-DGN in the approximation of directional derivatives and the prediction of graph signals on the synthetic data and the real-world climate observations from weather stations.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive computation, dynamic architectures, and resource-aware neural networks, here are some key findings and references that align with your detailed query:\n\n## Dynamic Architecture Adaptation Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of **adaptive rewiring** discussed in can be insightful for dynamic architecture adaptation. This principle involves the dynamic reorganization of a network based on internal signal communication, which can transform initial networks into more efficient and robust structures. While this is more focused on brain topology, the idea of dynamic reorganization can be adapted to neural networks.\n\n- The **Duo-LLM framework** presented in involves training a model with the ability to select between a big and small Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module within each layer. This allows for dynamic routing of tokens based on task complexity, effectively adapting the network structure to the input.\n\n## Adaptive Computation Techniques\n\n- The **Duo-LLM framework** is a prime example of adaptive computation. It integrates smaller auxiliary modules within each FFN layer, enabling the model to dynamically route tokens to either the small or big modules or even bypass certain layers. This approach optimizes computational resources based on the complexity of the input.\n\n- **Mixture of Experts (MoE) models** and **speculative decoding** mentioned in are other adaptive computation techniques. MoE models selectively activate different subsets of the model\u2019s parameters to reduce computational burden while maintaining performance. Speculative decoding generates future tokens using a smaller model and verifies them using a larger model.\n\n## Resource-Aware Neural Networks\n\n- The **Duo-LLM framework** is inherently resource-aware, as it dynamically adjusts the computation based on the input's complexity. This framework uses oracles to identify optimal routing patterns, ensuring efficient use of computational resources.\n\n- **Dynamic and hierarchical models** discussed in also enable more efficient processing by adjusting computation based on the input\u2019s complexity. These models can skip layers or use smaller modules when possible, reducing computational costs while preserving accuracy.\n\n## Methods for Dynamically Adjusting Network Structure or Computation\n\n- **Adaptive Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (A-CANNs)** incorporate adaptation mechanisms that allow the network to destabilize otherwise stable states, enabling rapid state updating. While this is more focused on attractor networks, the concept of adaptation can be applied to other types of neural networks.\n\n- **Sparse attention mechanisms** and **hierarchical processing structures** mentioned in your analysis note are crucial for efficient computation and memory management. The **Nystr\u00f6mformer** [as referenced in your analysis note] adapts the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with reduced complexity, which is another method for dynamically adjusting computation.\n\nIn summary, the **Duo-LLM framework** and the concepts of **adaptive rewiring**, **MoE models**, and **speculative decoding** provide strong foundations for dynamic architecture adaptation and adaptive computation. These approaches can help in designing more efficient, resource-aware, and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.35)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Score: 0.27)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Adaptive Computation in MLP Layers:**\n  - While adaptive computation has been effectively integrated within attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts frameworks (e.g., **SpikeGPT**, **MoA**), its application within MLP layers remains relatively unexplored. The **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** proposal aims to pioneer this integration, potentially leading to more efficient feedforward processing by dynamically adjusting computational resources based on input complexity.\n  - Existing models like **SpikeGPT** and **SeqBoat** demonstrate that replacing or augmenting attention mechanisms with adaptive and sparse components can lead to significant computational efficiency without compromising performance. These successes suggest that similar strategies could be beneficial when applied to MLP layers.\n\n- **Hierarchical Sparsity Structures:**\n  - Hierarchical sparsity has been successfully employed in attention mechanisms to manage computational complexity and enhance efficiency (e.g., **MoA**, **Routing Transformer**). Translating these principles to MLP layers could enable multi-scale information processing, allowing the model to handle diverse and complex input patterns more effectively.\n  - The **AdaptiveRetNetMLP**'s hierarchical sparse structure could leverage multi-level gating mechanisms to activate different computational paths based on input complexity, thereby optimizing resource allocation and improving scalability.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:**\n  - Models like **MoA** and **SpikeGPT** illustrate that adaptive and sparse computation can achieve comparable or superior performance with reduced computational resources. Applying similar efficiency gains to MLP layers in RetNet could result in substantial improvements in scalability, especially for large-scale language models.\n  - Hierarchical sparsity, as seen in **SeqBoat**, provides a pathway to achieve linear inference complexity while maintaining or enhancing model performance. This aligns well with the **AdaptiveRetNetMLP**'s goals of reducing computational costs and improving scalability.\n\n- **Integration Challenges:**\n  - Introducing adaptive computation and hierarchical sparsity into MLP layers presents challenges, including maintaining training stability, accurately estimating input complexity, and ensuring effective routing without introducing significant overhead. The design must address these challenges to realize the intended efficiency and scalability gains.\n  - The gating mechanisms and complexity estimators must be carefully designed to avoid disrupting the model's ability to generalize and to ensure that the dynamically adjusted computations do not hinder convergence during training.\n\n- **Novelty and Research Gaps:**\n  - Existing research primarily focuses on integrating adaptive mechanisms within attention layers and mixture-of-experts frameworks. The specific application of adaptive computation and hierarchical sparsity within MLP layers of autoregressive language models like RetNet appears underexplored, indicating a potential novelty in the **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** proposal.\n  - Further investigation is necessary to confirm the uniqueness of this approach and to identify any closely related works that might have explored similar modifications within MLP components.\n\n- **Comparative Performance Metrics:**\n  - Studies such as **Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective** and **AutoMoE** demonstrate that sparsity-informed pruning and adaptive mixtures can maintain or even enhance model performance while reducing computational costs. If **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** can similarly maintain or improve RetNet's performance while optimizing computation, it would represent a meaningful advancement in language model architecture.\n\n- **Theoretical and Empirical Foundations:**\n  - The proposal's theoretical underpinnings must be robust to justify the integration of adaptive computation and hierarchical sparsity. Empirical validations through comprehensive benchmarking against existing models will be crucial to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed modifications.\n  - Leveraging insights from related works on adaptive and sparse architectures can help in formulating theoretical justifications and guiding empirical evaluations for **AdaptiveRetNetMLP**.\n\n**4.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.53)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/50 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\nWe also report competitive results on enwik-8 ( 0.99 vs 0.98 perplexity) and present ablations on CIFAR-10. ## 2 Related Work\n\nAttention with Temporal Sparsity: Research on efficient attention neural models parallels the advent of attention-based architectures. In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.46)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/43 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 5484-5495, 2021.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.17)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive computation hierarchical sparsity neural network efficiency*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. AutoMoE: Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts with Adaptive Computation for Efficient Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive computation hierarchical sparsity neural network efficiency*\n\n*Ganesh Jawahar, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Xiaodong Liu, Young Jin Kim, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, L. Lakshmanan, A. Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

Deep Neural Network Initialization with Sparsity Inducing Activations\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive computation hierarchical sparsity neural network efficiency*\n\n*Ilan Price, Nicholas Daultry Ball, Samuel C.H. Lam, Adam C. Jones, Jared Tanner*\n\n**TL;DR:** The large width Gaussian process limit is used to analyze the behaviour of nonlinear activations that induce sparsity in the hidden outputs and shows that the proposed magnitude clipped sparsifying activations can be trained with training and test fractional sparsity as high as 85\\% while retaining close to full accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Inducing and leveraging sparse activations during training and inference is a promising avenue for improving the computational efficiency of deep networks, which is increasingly important as network sizes continue to grow and their application becomes more widespread. Here we use the large width Gaussian process limit to analyze the behaviour, at random initialization, of nonlinear activations that induce sparsity in the hidden outputs. A previously unreported form of training instability is proven for arguably two of the most natural candidates for hidden layer sparsification; those being a shifted ReLU ($\\phi(x)=\\max(0, x-\\tau)$ for $\\tau\\ge 0$) and soft thresholding ($\\phi(x)=0$ for $|x|\\le\\tau$ and $x-\\text{sign}(x)\\tau$ for $|x|>\\tau$). We show that this instability is overcome by clipping the nonlinear activation magnitude, at a level prescribed by the shape of the associated Gaussian process variance map. Numerical experiments verify the theory and show that the proposed magnitude clipped sparsifying activations can be trained with training and test fractional sparsity as high as 85\\% while retaining close to full accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Layer-adaptive Sparsity for the Magnitude-based Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive computation hierarchical sparsity neural network efficiency*\n\n*Jaeho Lee, Sejun Park, Sangwoo Mo, Sungsoo Ahn, Jinwoo Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel importance score for global pruning is proposed, coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level $\\ell_2$ distortion incurred by pruning, and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent discoveries on neural network pruning reveal that, with a carefully chosen layerwise sparsity, a simple magnitude-based pruning achieves state-of-the-art tradeoff between sparsity and performance. However, without a clear consensus on\"how to choose,\"the layerwise sparsities are mostly selected algorithm-by-algorithm, often resorting to handcrafted heuristics or an extensive hyperparameter search. To fill this gap, we propose a novel importance score for global pruning, coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level $\\ell_2$ distortion incurred by pruning, and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation. Under various image classification setups, LAMP consistently outperforms popular existing schemes for layerwise sparsity selection. Furthermore, we observe that LAMP continues to outperform baselines even in weight-rewinding setups, while the connectivity-oriented layerwise sparsity (the strongest baseline overall) performs worse than a simple global magnitude-based pruning in this case.

Differentiable hierarchical and surrogate gradient search for spiking neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive computation hierarchical sparsity neural network efficiency*\n\n*Kaiwei Che, Luziwei Leng, Kaixuan Zhang, Jianguo Zhang, Qinghu Meng, Jie Cheng, Qinghai Guo, Jianxing Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike- based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space, which finds effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost and exceeds the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural network (SNN) has been viewed as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are achieving competitive performances in benchmark tasks such as image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not necessary ideal for SNN and when tasks become more diverse effective architectural variations could be critical. To this end, we develop a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space. Based on this framework, we find effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost. During the training of SNN, a suboptimal surrogate gradient function could lead to poor approximations of true gradients, making the network enter certain local minima. To address this problem, we extend the differential approach to surrogate gradient search where the SG function is efficiently optimized locally. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performances on classification of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracy of 95.50%, 76.25% and 68.64%. On event-based deep stereo, our method finds optimal layer variation and surpasses the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile with 26 \u00d7 lower energy cost ( 6 . 7mJ ), demonstrating the advantage of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.37)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.17)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.16)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Adaptive Computation in MLP Layers**:\n  \n  Existing research predominantly integrates adaptive computation within attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts frameworks. The **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** proposal extends this concept to MLP layers, potentially filling a gap by enabling dynamic computation within the feedforward components of RetNet. This could lead to more granular control over computational resources, allowing MLP layers to adjust their depth and width based on input complexity, thereby enhancing efficiency.\n\n- **Hierarchical Sparsity Structures**:\n  \n  Hierarchical sparsity has been effectively utilized in attention mechanisms to manage computational complexity, as seen in **Routing Transformers** and **MoA**. Applying hierarchical sparsity within MLP layers could facilitate multi-scale information processing, allowing the model to handle diverse input patterns more effectively while conserving computational resources.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**:\n  \n  Techniques like **Sparse Modular Activation** and **AutoMoE** demonstrate that dynamic and sparse computation can lead to significant efficiency gains without compromising performance. Translating these benefits to MLP layers within RetNet could enhance the overall scalability of the model, especially for large-scale language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Integration Challenges**:\n  \n  Incorporating adaptive computation and hierarchical sparsity into MLP layers presents challenges, such as maintaining training stability, accurately estimating input complexity, and ensuring that the routing mechanisms do not disrupt the model's ability to generalize. Additionally, fine-tuning thresholds for sparsity and adaptive depth is critical to balance efficiency with performance.\n\n- **Novelty and Alignment with Research Trends**:\n  \n  While adaptive computation and sparsity are active research areas, their specific application within MLP layers of autoregressive models like RetNet appears less explored. This suggests potential novelty in the **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** proposal. Furthermore, the approach aligns with current trends towards more efficient and scalable neural network designs, addressing the pressing need for reducing computational overhead in large language models.\n\n- **Comparative Performance Metrics**:\n  \n  Studies such as **Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective** and **AutoMoE** indicate that sparsity-informed pruning and adaptive mixtures can maintain or even enhance model performance while reducing computational costs. Applying similar principles to MLP layers could yield comparable benefits, contingent on effective implementation.\n\n- **Training Dynamics and Theoretical Foundations**:\n  \n  Ensuring that adaptive computation mechanisms do not hinder the convergence of the model is essential. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies that provide insights into the stability and efficiency of dynamic and sparse computation will be beneficial in guiding the design of **AdaptiveRetNetMLP**.\n\n**4.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and until now, SNNs have yet to succeed at language generation on large-scale datasets. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement 'SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 46 M and 216 M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model when released, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Score: 0.27)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

This involves incorporating geometric feature constraints and mutual constraints to enhance performance, which could be analogous to the adaptive computation in MLP layers.\n\n### Efficient Channel Mixers\n- The use of improved MLP blocks with SwiGLU activation as channel mixers, as seen in the **Adventurer models**, can reduce computational load and improve efficiency. This is a practical example of how efficient channel mixers can be designed and integrated into models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and using the refined search queries, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to support the development of the **AdaptiveRetNetMLP** proposal, ensuring it addresses the challenges and leverages the insights from existing research effectively.\n",

Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face significant challenges in computational efficiency and resource utilization. While RetNet provides an excellent foundation through its retention mechanism, its MLP component uses fixed computation regardless of input complexity. This leads to unnecessary computation for simple patterns while potentially underutilizing resources for complex ones.\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis\n\nThe RetNetMLP component in the original RetNet architecture has several limitations:\n- Fixed computational depth regardless of input complexity\n- Uniform resource allocation across all inputs\n- Limited ability to adapt to varying computational requirements\n- Potential resource waste on simple patterns\n\n### 3. Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nWe propose to enhance RetNetMLP with two key innovations:\n1. Adaptive Computation: Dynamically adjust the network's computational depth based on input complexity\n2. Hierarchical Sparsity: Organize computation in a multi-scale structure for efficient information processing\n\n### 4. Design Plan\n\n#### 4.1 Architecture Overview\n\nThe AdaptiveRetNetMLP modifies the original RetNetMLP with:\n\n1. Adaptive Computation Layer:\n```python\nclass AdaptiveLayer:\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, intermediate_size):\n        self.complexity_estimator = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)\n        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, intermediate_size * 2)\n        self.down_proj = nn.Linear(intermediate_size, hidden_size)\n        self.act_fn = nn.SiLU()\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Estimate input complexity\n        complexity = torch.sigmoid(self.complexity_estimator(x))\n        \n        # Dynamic computation based on complexity\n        if complexity < threshold:\n            return x  # Skip computation for simple patterns\n            \n        # Standard computation with gating\n        y = self.gate_proj(x)\n        gate, y = y.chunk(2, -1)\n        z = self.act_fn(gate) * y\n        return self.down_proj(z)\n```\n\n2. Hierarchical Sparse Structure:\n```python\nclass HierarchicalSparseBlock:\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_levels=3):\n        self.levels = nn.ModuleList([\n            AdaptiveLayer(hidden_size >> i, hidden_size >> i)\n            for i in range(num_levels)\n        ])\n        self.router = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_levels)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Route input to appropriate levels\n        routing_weights = F.softmax(self.router(x), dim=-1)\n        \n        # Process through levels with sparse activation\n        outputs = []\n        for i, level in enumerate(self.levels):\n            mask = routing_weights[:, :, i:i+1] > sparsity_threshold\n            if mask.any():\n                level_out = level(x * mask)\n                outputs.append(level_out)\n                \n        return sum(outputs)\n```\n\n#### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe adaptive computation mechanism is governed by:\n\n1.

The design incorporates adaptive computation mechanisms that allow the network to dynamically adjust its computational depth and width based on input complexity, combined with a hierarchical sparse structure that enables efficient information processing at multiple scales. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while preserving or improving model capabilities through intelligent resource allocation.",
