Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units (Avg.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415.

Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/39 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\n4. \u00a7B. 2 presents a detailed derivation. Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: selective linear attention hierarchical test-time training\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: selective linear attention hierarchical test-time training*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 557  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n#### 3.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

However, distribution shift is a common problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of subpopulation shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts. While prior works often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations or predictors of the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to learn invariant predictors without restricting the model's internal representations or predictors. This leads to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but different labels. Empirically, we study the effectiveness of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts, and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and leads to more invariant predictors. We further analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 169  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve their autoregressive language model design by integrating selective mechanisms with linear attention, implementing hierarchical test-time training, and ensuring stability in dynamic architectures, here are some key findings from the provided sources:\n\n## Combining Selective Mechanisms with Linear Attention\n\n- The paper on **Taipan** introduces a selective attention mechanism that strategically selects key tokens in the input sequence, refining their features and passing them through an attention module to capture long-range dependencies. This approach balances the computational efficiency of linear attention models like Mamba with enhanced long-range modeling capabilities.\n- **Longhorn** discusses various linear attention variants, including Gated Linear Attention (GLA), which assumes a form of selective attention by using gated mechanisms to control the flow of information. This can be seen as a way to combine selective computation with linear attention efficiency.\n\n## Hierarchical Approaches to Test-Time Training\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss hierarchical test-time training, the concept of hierarchical processing can be inferred from models like **Taipan**, which uses hierarchical selective attention layers. Integrating this hierarchical structure with test-time training capabilities, as seen in models like **FastTTTLinear**, could be a promising direction. The hierarchical memory management in **SelectiveGPT** can also be adapted for test-time training by dynamically adjusting parameters based on the input during inference.\n\n## Stability Techniques for Dynamic Architectures\n\n- **Taipan** addresses stability and efficiency by using selective attention layers that reduce the computational costs associated with full attention mechanisms. This selective approach helps in maintaining stability by focusing attention on a subset of important tokens, thereby avoiding the complexity and potential instability of processing all tokens equally.\n- The design of **Longhorn** and other state space models (SSMs) emphasizes the importance of well-defined online learning objectives and recurrence rules, which can contribute to the stability of dynamic architectures by ensuring that the state transitions are optimized and consistent.\n\n## Implementation Strategies for Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Taipan** implements an attention budget constraint during training, which ensures that only a predefined fraction of tokens receive attention. This approach, combined with the Straight Through Gumbel Softmax estimator, allows for efficient and differentiable token selection, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.\n- **Longhorn** and other SSMs like **Mamba** use linear attention variants that reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional Transformers, making them more efficient in terms of computation and memory usage. These models achieve this by using linear mappings and recurrence rules that are optimized for online learning objectives.\n\n## Empirical Comparisons of Different Attention Variants\n\n- The **Longhorn** paper provides empirical results comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art SSMs, such as **Mamba**. Longhorn demonstrates better performance and a significant speedup in sampling efficiency compared to Mamba, highlighting the effectiveness of its novel recurrence and attention mechanisms.\n- **Taipan** also compares its performance with other efficient attention mechanisms, showing that its selective attention approach balances computational efficiency with enhanced long-range modeling capabilities, outperforming models that use full attention or standard windowed attention.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages selective mechanisms with linear attention, incorporates hierarchical processing and test-time training, and maintains stability through optimized recurrence rules and efficient attention mechanisms.\n",

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/50 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nWe also report competitive results on enwik-8 ( 0.99 vs 0.98 perplexity) and present ablations on CIFAR-10. ## 2 Related Work\n\nAttention with Temporal Sparsity: Research on efficient attention neural models parallels the advent of attention-based architectures. In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. \u221e-former: Infinite Memory Transformer (Avg.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: sparse linear attention optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: sparse linear attention optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner.

Autonomous Sparse Mean-CVaR Portfolio Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: sparse linear attention optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Yizun Lin, Yangyu Zhang, Zhao-Rong Lai, Cheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** An innovative autonomous sparse mean-CVaR portfolio model, capable of approximating the original $\\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model with arbitrary accuracy, and offering a theoretically guaranteed approximation of the $\\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model.\n\n**Abstract:** The $\\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model poses a significant challenge due to its NP-hard nature, typically tackled through combinatorial methods characterized by high computational demands. From a markedly different perspective, we propose an innovative autonomous sparse mean-CVaR portfolio model, capable of approximating the original $\\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model with arbitrary accuracy. The core idea is to convert the $\\ell_0$ constraint into an indicator function and subsequently handle it through a tailed approximation. We then propose a proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm, coupled with a nested fixed-point proximity algorithm (both convergent), to iteratively solve the model. Autonomy in sparsity refers to retaining a significant portion of assets within the selected asset pool during adjustments in pool size. Consequently, our framework offers a theoretically guaranteed approximation of the $\\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model, improving computational efficiency while providing a robust asset selection scheme.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse linear attention optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. MATE: Multi-view Attention for Table Transformer Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: sparse linear attention optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Maharshi Gor, Thomas M\u00fcller, William W. Cohen*\n\n**TL;DR:** MATE is proposed, a novel Transformer architecture designed to model the structure of web tables that uses sparse attention in a way that allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table.\n\n**Abstract:** This work presents a sparse-attention Transformer architecture for modeling documents that contain large tables. Tables are ubiquitous on the web, and are rich in information. However, more than 20% of relational tables on the web have 20 or more rows (Cafarella et al., 2008), and these large tables present a challenge for current Transformer models, which are typically limited to 512 tokens. Here we propose MATE, a novel Transformer architecture designed to model the structure of web tables. MATE uses sparse attention in a way that allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This architecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle documents containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also has a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new state-of-the-art for three table reasoning datasets. For HybridQA (Chen et al., 2020), a dataset that involves large documents containing tables, we improve the best prior result by 19 points.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 84  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on combining sparse and linear attention mechanisms, optimizing hardware efficiency, and implementing memory-efficient hierarchical attention, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Combining Sparse and Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" discusses a hybrid architecture that combines sparse and dense attention. This approach involves sharding the context heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. This hybrid design balances efficiency and performance, which is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper introduces a method that learns block-wise attention sparsity, which can be integrated with linear attention mechanisms. SeerAttention uses a learnable gating module (AttnGate) to identify significant blocks in the attention maps, allowing for block-sparse attention computation. This approach reduces I/O and computation overhead, making it efficient for modern hardware like GPUs.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Attention Computation\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper provides detailed insights into hardware optimization. It emphasizes the importance of designing sparse attention with hardware and software systems in mind. The S2-Attention kernel optimizes sparse attention by efficiently tracking KV usage patterns and dynamically merging sparse query blocks, ensuring each tile is fully utilized regardless of sparsity granularity. This approach improves SRAM utilization and minimizes redundant KV loading, leading to significant speedups.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper also focuses on hardware efficiency by implementing a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel. This kernel uses a similar dataflow to FlashAttention-2 but with the addition of a learnable gating module to identify and compute only the significant blocks. This approach achieves a 5.47\u00d7 speedup over FlashAttention-2 on a single A100 GPU.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Attention\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss hierarchical attention in the context of autoregressive language models, the concept of block sparsity and tiling can be extended to hierarchical structures. For instance, SeerAttention's block-wise sparsity can be adapted to hierarchical attention mechanisms by applying the sparsity at different levels of the hierarchy, thus reducing memory and computational overhead.\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper suggests that sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads can be applied in a hierarchical manner, where different heads or layers attend to different subsets of tokens, collectively covering the full context. This approach can help in managing memory efficiently by ensuring that each head or layer processes only the relevant tokens.\n\n## Efficient Test-Time Training Methods\n\n- The sources provided do not directly address test-time training methods. However, the general principle of using learnable gating modules and block sparsity, as seen in SeerAttention, can be extended to test-time training. By learning the sparsity patterns during training and applying them during test time, the model can maintain efficiency and performance even in unseen data scenarios.\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Different Attention Optimization Approaches\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper compares the performance of their S2-Attention approach with the FlashAttention-2 baseline. It reports significant speedups (8.79X, 15.87X, 25.3X) and maintains strong downstream performance on-par with full attention.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper compares its performance with FlashAttention-2, achieving a 5.47\u00d7 speedup at a sequence length of 128k with 90% sparsity. This demonstrates the efficiency gains of using block-wise sparsity in attention mechanisms.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014combining sparse and linear attention, optimizing for hardware efficiency, and implementing memory-efficient hierarchical structures\u2014the researcher can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/48 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nSmola, and Eduard H.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/34 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\n(11) and (12) is generally unknown. So gathering empirical evidences seems the only viable path to answer the first question listed above. The ablation studies by (Khandelwal et al., 2018) examine the effect of context words on a language model. Within the context range of about 200 tokens, word order is only relevant within the 20 most recent tokens or about a sentence. In the long-range context, order has almost no effect on performance, suggesting that the model maintains a high-level, rough semantic representation of faraway words. The observation is succinctly summarized by the title of the paper \"sharp nearby, fuzzy far away\". Remarkably, this is in spirit very close to the key insight into the Multilevel Methods. A few recent attention-related studies have explored this direction with some success, such as word-level and sentence-level attentions in (Miculicich et al., 2018; Abreu et al., 2019), and sentence-level and paragraph-level attentions in (Liu and Lapata, 2019). Even though the proposed hierarchical attention in these studies only has two levels, as opposed to ten or more levels typically used by the Multilevel Methods, the reported positive results are quite suggestive. We therefore hypothesize that the same hierarchical low-rank structure as shown in Eq (13) might also hold for the attention matrix in many NLP tasks. And we treat it as the inductive bias in the hierarchical attention mechanism proposed in this paper. As pointed out in (Goyal and Bengio, 2020), inductive biases encourage the learning algorithm to prioritise solutions with certain properties. Hence good benchmark performance delivered by a Transformer-based model with proposed hierarchical attention can be regarded as a positive evidence to support the hierarchical low-rank structure hypothesis. ### 5.2 Informal Exposition of Hierarchical Attention\n\nIn the standard definition of attention in Eq. (3) and (4), there is no preference given to any keys based on the sequence distance between a query and keys. The observation in (Khandelwal et al.,\n2018) clearly suggests that a distance-dependent attention mechanism should be a better alternative. We will take three steps to informally explain the hierarchical attention mechanism. First, the attention matrix blocks for nearby, mid-distance and long-distance attention are separated in section 5.2.1. This is the first step toward the distance-dependent attention mentioned above. Second, a token hierarchy is established in section 5.2.2. Third, the hierarchical attention is constructed in section 5.2.3\n\n### 5.2.1 Attention Partition\n\nConsider a 16-word sentence in Fig. 1. The sentence is partitioned at three segment granularity. This induces a three-level partition of the attention matrix $A$ for the original sequence:\n\n$$\nA=A^{(2)}+A^{(1)}+A^{(0)}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nA^{(2)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}\n0 & A_{12}^{(2)} \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(2)} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-05.jpg?height=258&width=600&top_left_y=1539&top_left_x=291)\n\n$$\nA^{(0)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\nA_{11}^{(0)} & A_{12}^{(0)} & & & \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(0)} & A_{22}^{(0)} & A_{23}^{(0)} & & \\\\\n\\hline & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\hline & & & A_{87}^{(0)} & A_{88}^{(0)}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the nonzero entries in $A^{(0)}, A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are the same as the corresponding entries of matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 4. \u221e-former: Infinite Memory Transformer (Avg.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Efros*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses masked autoencoders to improve generalization on many visual benchmarks for distribution shifts and characterize this improvement in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time training adapts to a new test distribution on the fly by optimizing a model for each test input using self-supervision.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training optimization stability*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 180  (*Influential: 57*)\n\n#### 3. SODA: Robust Training of Test-Time Data Adaptors\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training optimization stability*\n\n*Zige Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Bo Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** P pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) is proposed, which leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction and can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting models deployed to test distributions can mitigate the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts. However, privacy concerns may render model parameters inaccessible. One promising approach involves utilizing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) to train a data adaptor to adapt the test data to fit the deployed models. Nevertheless, the data adaptor trained with ZOO typically brings restricted improvements due to the potential corruption of data features caused by the data adaptor. To address this issue, we revisit ZOO in the context of test-time data adaptation. We find that the issue directly stems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data adaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels assigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data adaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction. For data with low-confidence predictions, SODA encourages the adaptor to preserve data information to mitigate data corruption. Empirical results indicate that SODA can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training optimization stability*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. AdaNPC: Exploring Non-Parametric Classifier for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training optimization stability*\n\n*Yi-Fan Zhang, Xue Wang, Kexin Jin, Kun Yuan, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tien-Ping Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work adopts Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC), and builds a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains that can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent machine learning tasks focus to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

For instance, the paper on \"Zero-Shot Image Manipulation Localization with Test-Time Training\" discusses a TTT framework that involves a shared encoder and auxiliary heads for self-supervised learning. This framework can be adapted for hierarchical models by fine-tuning the encoder at different hierarchical levels based on self-supervised objectives.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Test-Time Adaptation**:\n   In the context of shadow detection, the \"Test-Time Intensity Consistency Adaptation (TICA)\" method updates only the encoder during the test-time adaptation phase, which can be extended to hierarchical models by applying similar consistency constraints at different hierarchical levels. This approach ensures that the model adapts robustly to new data while maintaining consistency across different regions or scales.\n\n### Stability Techniques for Dynamic Architectures\n\n1. **Stability through Self-Supervised Learning**:\n   Test-time training methods often rely on self-supervised learning to adapt models to new data distributions. This approach helps in maintaining stability by ensuring that the model's adaptations are consistent with the task at hand. For example, the use of self-supervised objective functions during test-time training helps in generalizing the model to out-of-distribution data without compromising stability.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Structures for Stability**:\n   Hierarchical models inherently provide a structured approach to processing data, which can enhance stability. By managing different granularities through hierarchical processing, models can avoid overfitting and maintain robustness even when adapting to new data distributions.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Attention\n\n1. **Tiling and Block-Based Processing**:\n   Methods like those described in \"Short-Long Convolutions\" leverage tiling and hierarchy to implement linear attention efficiently. This approach can be extended to hierarchical attention mechanisms by dividing the attention process into smaller blocks, which improves hardware utilization and reduces memory movement.\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention and Selective Routing**:\n   The use of gated linear attention combined with selective routing can significantly improve the efficiency of hierarchical attention models. This approach, as discussed in \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers,\" allows for dynamic sparse attention patterns that are both efficient and flexible.\n\n### Optimization Strategies for Combined Sparse-Linear Attention\n\n1. **Sparse Modular Activation**:\n   Techniques such as sparse modular activation can optimize the efficiency of sequence modeling by selectively activating modules based on the input. This can be integrated with linear attention to create sparse-linear attention mechanisms that are both efficient and effective.\n\n2. **Optimizing Memory Access Patterns**:\n   Optimizing memory access patterns is crucial for efficient implementation. Hierarchical structures can help in managing memory usage efficiently by employing block-wise sparsity patterns and ensuring hardware-aware memory access. This approach balances parallelization with memory efficiency, as highlighted in the analysis summary.\n\n### Performance Analysis of Hierarchical Attention Models\n\n1. **Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention**:\n   The \"Routing Transformers\" paper discusses efficient content-based sparse attention that combines the flexibility of content-based sparse attention with the efficiency of local, temporal sparse attention. This approach can be analyzed for its performance in hierarchical models, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and modeling flexibility.\n\n2. **Performance Metrics and Validation**:\n   Performance analysis should include metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs. The use of k-fold cross-validation, as mentioned in the comparison of deep and conventional machine learning models, can help in ensuring the reliability and robustness of the outcomes.\n\nBy integrating these methods and techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient and scalable but also robust and adaptable to new data distributions. The key insights from the analysis summary, such as using gated linear attention, hierarchical processing, and optimizing memory access patterns, will be crucial in achieving these goals.\n",

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical attention stability optimization hardware efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. The Numerical Stability of Hyperbolic Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention stability optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Gal Mishne, Zhengchao Wan, Yusu Wang, Sheng Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work carefully analyzes the limitation of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincar\\'e ball and the Lorentz model and identifies one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperBolic space which can alleviate these limitations.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the exponential growth of the volume of the ball w.r.t. its radius, the hyperbolic space is capable of embedding trees with arbitrarily small distortion and hence has received wide attention for representing hierarchical datasets. However, this exponential growth property comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we carefully analyze the limitation of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincar\\'e ball and the Lorentz model. We first show that, under the 64 bit arithmetic system, the Poincar\\'e ball has a relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points. Then, we theoretically validate the superiority of the Lorentz model over the Poincar\\'e ball from the perspective of optimization. Given the numerical limitations of both models, we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate these limitations. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes and exhibits its ability in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Context Merging: Better Long Context Understanding for Pre-trained LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention stability optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Woomin Song, Seunghyuk Oh, Sangwoo Mo, Jaehyung Kim, Sukmin Yun, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HOMER is presented, a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations of large language models by employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers and proposes an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context.

FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention stability optimization hardware efficiency*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, and parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 678  (*Influential: 70*)\n\n#### 5.

For test-time adaptation, this can involve updating only the necessary components of the model (e.g., the encoder) while keeping the rest of the model fixed, reducing memory and computational requirements.\n\n2. **Data Augmentation and Generation Techniques**:\n   - Techniques like those described in \"Diffusion Meets DAgger\" can be adapted for test-time training by generating new samples using diffusion models, which can be more memory-efficient than collecting new real-world data.\n\n### Performance Analysis of Combined Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Combining hierarchical attention mechanisms with test-time training can be evaluated by analyzing the performance across different scales. This involves assessing how well the model adapts to new data at various levels of granularity.\n\n2. **Stability and Generalization**:\n   - Evaluating the stability and generalization capabilities of the model under different test-time training strategies is crucial. This can involve comparing the performance of models with and without hierarchical attention and test-time training on various benchmarks.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive LM design, the researcher should focus on:\n\n- Integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms with test-time training using self-supervised objectives.\n- Ensuring stability through conservative regularization and gradient-based stability measures.\n- Optimizing hardware efficiency using block-based processing and hardware-aware optimizations.\n- Implementing memory-efficient test-time adaptation by updating only necessary model components and using efficient memory management.\n- Conducting thorough performance analysis to evaluate the combined attention mechanisms across different scales and stability metrics.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Deja Vu: Contextual Sparsity for Efficient LLMs at Inference Time\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*Zichang Liu, Jue Wang, Tri Dao, Tianyi Zhou, Binhang Yuan, Zhao Song, Anshumali Shrivastava, Ce Zhang, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** DejaVu is proposed, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality.

ViG: Linear-complexity Visual Sequence Learning with Gated Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*Chang Huang, Qian Zhang, Lianghui Zhu, Xinggang Wang, Bencheng Liao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have achieved modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers on a variety of computer vision tasks, while using fewer FLOPs and less memory. However, their advantage in terms of actual runtime speed is not significant. To address this issue, we introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its superior hardware-awareness and efficiency. We propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to adaptively inject 2D local details into 1D global context. Our hardware-aware implementation further merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. The proposed model, ViG, offers a favorable trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. Notably, ViG-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27% of the parameters and 20% of the FLOPs, running 2$\\times$ faster on $224\\times224$ images. At $1024\\times1024$ resolution, ViG-T uses 5.2$\\times$ fewer FLOPs, saves 90% GPU memory, runs 4.8$\\times$ faster, and achieves 20.7% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T.

Complex-valued Neural Networks with Non-parametric Activation Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*Aurelio Uncini, Simone Scardapane, Amir Hussain, Steven Van Vaerenbergh*\n\n**Abstract:** Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are a powerful modeling tool for\ndomains where data can be naturally interpreted in terms of complex numbers.\nHowever, several analytical properties of the complex domain (e.g.,\nholomorphicity) make the design of CVNNs a more challenging task than their\nreal counterpart. In this paper, we consider the problem of flexible activation\nfunctions (AFs) in the complex domain, i.e., AFs endowed with sufficient\ndegrees of freedom to adapt their shape given the training data. While this\nproblem has received considerable attention in the real case, a very limited\nliterature exists for CVNNs, where most activation functions are generally\ndeveloped in a split fashion (i.e., by considering the real and imaginary parts\nof the activation separately) or with simple phase-amplitude techniques.\nLeveraging over the recently proposed kernel activation functions (KAFs), and\nrelated advances in the design of complex-valued kernels, we propose the first\nfully complex, non-parametric activation function for CVNNs, which is based on\na kernel expansion with a fixed dictionary that can be implemented efficiently\non vectorized hardware. Several experiments on common use cases, including\nprediction and channel equalization, validate our proposal when compared to\nreal-valued neural networks and CVNNs with fixed activation functions.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Progressive Stochastic Binarization of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient adaptive attention implementation*\n\n*David Hartmann, Michael Wand*\n\n**Abstract:** A plethora of recent research has focused on improving the memory footprint\nand inference speed of deep networks by reducing the complexity of (i)\nnumerical representations (for example, by deterministic or stochastic\nquantization) and (ii) arithmetic operations (for example, by binarization of\nweights).\n  We propose a stochastic binarization scheme for deep networks that allows for\nefficient inference on hardware by restricting itself to additions of small\nintegers and fixed shifts. Unlike previous approaches, the underlying\nrandomized approximation is progressive, thus permitting an adaptive control of\nthe accuracy of each operation at run-time. In a low-precision setting, we\nmatch the accuracy of previous binarized approaches. Our representation is\nunbiased - it approaches continuous computation with increasing sample size. In\na high-precision regime, the computational costs are competitive with previous\nquantization schemes. Progressive stochastic binarization also permits\nlocalized, dynamic accuracy control within a single network, thereby providing\na new tool for adaptively focusing computational attention.\n  We evaluate our method on networks of various architectures, already\npretrained on ImageNet. With representational costs comparable to previous\nschemes, we obtain accuracies close to the original floating point\nimplementation. This includes pruned networks, except the known special case of\ncertain types of separated convolutions. By focusing computational attention\nusing progressive sampling, we reduce inference costs on ImageNet further by a\nfactor of up to 33% (before network pruning).\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations of adaptive attention mechanisms, optimization techniques for dynamic parameter updates, memory management strategies, and implementation details of combined attention architectures, here are some key findings and references from recent papers (2023-2024):\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on \"Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers\" introduces several innovations that can be applied to general language models. It proposes the use of Head Partitioning Self Attention (HPSA), which significantly reduces computational complexity and memory footprint. HPSA divides attention heads into two groups, enhancing efficiency and introducing a graph-structure inductive bias.\n\n- Another relevant approach is the \"Lightning Attention-2\" method, which enables linear attention to achieve its theoretical computational benefits. This implementation retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length, making it highly scalable[Analysis Note - Round 3, b).\n\n## Optimization Techniques for Dynamic Parameter Updates\n\n- The \"Continual Pre-training\" paper discusses a soft-masking mechanism that directly controls the update to the language model, preserving general knowledge. This method helps in maintaining stable parameter updates and is crucial for dynamic parameter management[Analysis Note - Round 3, d).\n\n## Memory Management Strategies for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The \"Streaming Language Models\" paper provides insights into efficient memory management by addressing the \"attention sink phenomenon.\" It suggests that keeping the key-value pairs of initial tokens can largely recover the performance of window attention, which is essential for handling long sequences efficiently[Analysis Note - Round 3, c).\n\n## Implementation Details of Combined Attention Architectures\n\n- The \"Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers\" paper also introduces a novel approach that combines several techniques. It includes weight quantization to the ternary domain through Adaptive Absolute Percentile (AAP) quantization, HPSA for efficient multi-head self-attention, and spectral positional encoding (SPE) of the Tanner graph. These modifications enhance both performance and efficiency by reducing computational complexity and memory usage.\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" and other related works emphasize the importance of balancing expressiveness with efficiency. These papers suggest that hardware-aware design and efficient linear attention implementations can be combined to achieve better overall performance[Analysis Note - Round 3, b).\n\nThese findings and techniques can help researchers in designing more efficient, scalable, and adaptive autoregressive language models, addressing key challenges such as training stability, memory management, and hardware efficiency.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3.

Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 557  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n#### 4.

Improving Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Selective Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Huaxiu Yao, Yu Wang, Sai Li, Linjun Zhang, Weixin Liang, James Y. Zou, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper considers the problems of subpopulation shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts and develops a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA, and finds that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and leads to more invariant predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning algorithms typically assume that training and test examples are drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of subpopulation shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts. While prior works often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations or predictors of the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to learn invariant predictors without restricting the model's internal representations or predictors. This leads to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but different labels. Empirically, we study the effectiveness of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts, and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and leads to more invariant predictors. We further analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 169  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve their autoregressive language model design, focusing on the integration of selective gating mechanisms with linear attention, test-time training approaches, adaptive parameter generation techniques, and memory-efficient attention implementations, here are some relevant findings from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Integration of Selective Gating Mechanisms with Linear Attention\n\n- The paper on \"Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners\" discusses various linear attention models and state-space models (SSMs), including those with selective gating mechanisms. For example, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) introduces learnable forget gates, which can be seen as a form of selective gating. GLA assumes \\( \\text{At} = 1 \\cdot \\alpha(\\text{xt}) \\), where \\( \\alpha(\\text{xt}) \\) is a learnable function.\n\n## Test-Time Training Approaches in Language Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss test-time training in the context of language models, the concept of online learning and adaptive updates is relevant. The \"Longhorn\" paper frames SSMs as solving online learning objectives, which could be adapted for test-time training. This framework suggests that models like Longhorn could be updated online, potentially aligning with test-time training needs.\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Generation Techniques\n\n- The \"Falcon Mamba\" paper touches on the idea of adaptive parameter generation indirectly through its discussion of hybrid architectures and dynamic training strategies. For instance, the use of batch size rampup and batch scaling to maintain constant Adam noise temperature during training can be seen as a form of adaptive parameter adjustment. However, this is more about training strategy than explicit parameter generation at test time.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n- The \"Falcon Mamba\" paper discusses the scalability and efficiency of Mamba-based models, which are designed to be more memory-efficient compared to traditional Transformer models. It highlights the use of selective state mechanisms and hybrid designs that combine Mamba with Transformer layers, which can improve both performance and efficiency.\n\n- The \"Longhorn\" paper also addresses memory efficiency by proposing a state-space model that does not require manually designed gating mechanisms, thus saving parameters. This design ensures stable recurrent updates without increasing the parameter count significantly.\n\n## Additional Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**: This work by Yang et al. (2023) is mentioned in the initial analysis and is crucial for understanding how selective gating can be integrated with linear attention. It provides a detailed framework for implementing gated mechanisms within linear attention models[Initial Analysis].\n\n- **Hierarchical Context Merging**: The work by Song et al. (2024) on hierarchical context merging could be relevant for improving memory efficiency and handling long sequences. This approach might be integrated with the proposed adaptive selective attention mechanism to enhance overall model performance[Initial Analysis].\n\n- **FlashAttention-2**: Dao's work on FlashAttention-2 (2023) could provide insights into more efficient attention mechanisms that might be combined with selective gating and test-time training approaches[Initial Analysis].\n\nBy combining these elements, the researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model that integrates selective gating with linear attention, leverages test-time training for adaptability, and employs hierarchical memory management for efficiency. This approach aligns with the goal of achieving low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nAydar Bulatov, Yury Kuratov, and Mikhail Burtsev. 2022.

Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the memory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a primary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer models, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query vectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely exclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding queries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\\% with negligible performance degradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/18 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06262, 2024.

Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bo Li, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore domain-adaptive training to reduce the toxicity of language models and demonstrates that adding and training adapter-only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for the large-scale models.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (LMs) are shown to easily generate toxic language. In this work, we systematically explore domain-adaptive training to reduce the toxicity of language models. We conduct this study on three dimensions: training corpus, model size, and parameter efficiency. For the training corpus, we propose to leverage the generative power of LMs and generate nontoxic datasets for domain-adaptive training, which mitigates the exposure bias and is shown to be more data-efficient than using a curated pre-training corpus. We demonstrate that the self-generation method consistently outperforms the existing baselines across various model sizes on both automatic and human evaluations, even when it uses a 1/3 smaller training corpus. We then comprehensively study detoxifying LMs with parameter sizes ranging from 126M up to 530B (3x larger than GPT-3), a scale that has never been studied before. We find that i) large LMs have similar toxicity levels as smaller ones given the same pre-training corpus, and ii) large LMs require more endeavor to detoxify. We also explore parameter-efficient training methods for detoxification. We demonstrate that adding and training adapter-only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for the large-scale models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Unified Detoxifying and Debiasing in Language Generation via Inference-time Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation language models*\n\n*Zonghan Yang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Xing Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several strong baselines, UDDIA achieves debiasing and detoxifying simultaneously and better balances efficiency and effectiveness, taking a further step towards practical ethical NLG.\n\n**Abstract:** Warning: this paper contains model outputs exhibiting offensiveness and biases. Recently pre-trained language models (PLMs) have prospered in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their ability to generate fairly fluent text. Nevertheless, these models are observed to capture and reproduce harmful contents in training corpora, typically toxic language and social biases, raising severe moral issues. Prior works on ethical NLG tackle detoxifying and debiasing separately, which is problematic since we find debiased models still exhibit toxicity while detoxified ones even exacerbate social biases. To address such a challenge, we propose the first unified framework of detoxifying and debiasing called UDDIA, which jointly formalizes these two problems as rectifying the output space. We theoretically interpret our framework as learning a text distribution mixing weighted attributes. Besides, UDDIA conducts adaptive optimization of only a few parameters during decoding based on a parameter-efficient tuning schema without any training data. This leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved rectification performance with acceptable computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several strong baselines, UDDIA achieves debiasing and detoxifying simultaneously and better balances efficiency and effectiveness, taking a further step towards practical ethical NLG.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Rapid explosion in model sizes has resulted in high inference times. In this work, we propose DynaMo, a suite of multi-token prediction language models that reduce net inference times. Our models *dynamically* predict multiple tokens based on their confidence in the predicted joint probability distribution. We propose a lightweighttechnique to train these models, leveraging the weights of traditional autoregressive counterparts. Moreover, we propose novel ways to enhance the estimated joint probability to improve text generation quality, namely co-occurrence weighted masking and adaptive thresholding. We also propose systematic qualitative and quantitative methods to rigorously test the quality of generated text for non-autoregressive generation. One of the models in our suite, DynaMo-7.3B-T3, achieves same-quality generated text as the baseline (Pythia-6.9B) while achieving 2.57\\times speed-up with only 5.87% and 2.67% parameter and training time overheads, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Federated Learning of Large Language Models with Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning and Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation language models*\n\n*Tianshi Che, Ji Liu, Yang Zhou, Jiaxiang Ren, Jiwen Zhou, Victor S. Sheng, H. Dai, D. Dou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs and a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

Because of their success, the size of these models has increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG), with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results, as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG. We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results. We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language generations.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. VILA: Learning Image Aesthetics from User Comments with Vision-Language Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation language models*\n\n*Feng Yang, Peyman Milanfar, Yonghui Wu, Jiahui Yu, Keren Ye, Junjie Ke*\n\n**Abstract:** Assessing the aesthetics of an image is challenging, as it is influenced by multiple factors including composition, color, style, and high-level semantics. Existing image aesthetic assessment (IAA) methods primarily rely on human-labeled rating scores, which oversimplify the visual aesthetic information that humans perceive. Conversely, user comments offer more comprehensive information and are a more natural way to express human opinions and preferences regarding image aesthetics. In light of this, we propose learning image aesthetics from user comments, and exploring vision-language pretraining methods to learn multimodal aesthetic representations. Specifically, we pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder model with image-comment pairs, using contrastive and generative objectives to learn rich and generic aesthetic semantics without human labels. To efficiently adapt the pretrained model for downstream IAA tasks, we further propose a lightweight rank-based adapter that employs text as an anchor to learn the aesthetic ranking concept. Our results show that our pretrained aesthetic vision-language model outperforms prior works on image aesthetic captioning over the AVA-Captions dataset, and it has powerful zero-shot capability for aesthetic tasks such as zero-shot style classification and zero-shot IAA, surpassing many supervised baselines. With only minimal finetuning parameters using the proposed adapter module, our model achieves state-of-the-art IAA performance over the AVA dataset.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Bridging The Gap between Low-rank and Orthogonal Adaptation via Householder Reflection Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation language models*\n\n*Hongteng Xu, Haotian Liu, Shen Yuan*\n\n**Abstract:** While following different technical routes, both low-rank and orthogonal adaptation techniques can efficiently adapt large-scale pre-training models in specific tasks or domains based on a small piece of trainable parameters. In this study, we bridge the gap between these two techniques, proposing a simple but effective adaptation method based on Householder reflections. Given a pre-trained model, our method fine-tunes its layers by multiplying each frozen weight matrix with an orthogonal matrix constructed by a chain of learnable Householder reflections (HRs). This HR-based orthogonal fine-tuning is equivalent to an adaptive low-rank adaptation. Moreover, we show that the orthogonality of the reflection planes corresponding to the HRs impacts the model capacity and regularity. The analysis motivates us to regularize the orthogonality of the HRs, leading to different implementations of the proposed Householder reflection adaptation (HRA) method. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, HRA achieves superior performance with fewer learnable parameters when adapting large language models and conditional image generators. The code of the experiments is available at \\url{https://github.com/DaShenZi721/HRA}, and the method has been merged into the \\href{https://github.com/huggingface/peft}{PEFT} package.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, here are some recent papers and concepts that align with the specified keywords and details:\n\n## Test-Time Adaptation in Language Models\n\n- The concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) is particularly relevant. A recent work discussed in mentions TTT models that continue to learn and adapt during use. This approach involves training different sequences of weights for every input sequence at test time, which can enhance the model's ability to understand specific texts better. This dynamic adaptation is a key feature that can be integrated into autoregressive language models to improve their performance and adaptability.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- The paper on \"ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (StRing)\" discusses a method where well-trained positions are shifted to overwrite original ineffective positions during inference. While not directly about dynamic parameter generation, it shows how adjusting position embeddings can enhance performance without additional training. For dynamic parameter generation, the concept of adapting model parameters at test time, as seen in TTT models, is crucial. Another relevant work could be the integration of gated mechanisms and adaptive parameter updates, such as those discussed in the context of Griffin, which mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention.\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Management\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" paper [Analysis Note, Reference b] introduces efficient implementation strategies for linear attention, including tiling techniques for hardware optimization. These techniques can be adapted for efficient memory management in autoregressive models. Additionally, the work on \"Transformers are SSMs\" by Dao and Gu discusses generalized models and efficient algorithms through structured state space duality, which can provide insights into memory-efficient state management.\n\n## Adaptive Computation in Transformers\n\n- The \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" [Analysis Note, Reference a] and \"Griffin\" [Analysis Note, Reference c] papers are highly relevant here. Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers are effective at length generalization and use data-dependent gates to improve efficiency. Griffin integrates gated linear recurrences with local attention, providing a balance between local and global attention patterns and demonstrating how adaptive mechanisms can enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficiency.\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" paper also offers insights into adaptive computation by enabling linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits, retaining consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: Recent advancements in efficient attention mechanisms, such as those discussed in and the references in the analysis note, are crucial for improving the performance and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n- **Hardware-Aware Implementations**: The importance of hardware-aware implementations, as highlighted in the analysis note and papers like \"Lightning Attention-2,\" cannot be overstated. These implementations are vital for practical deployment and efficient memory management.\n- **Adaptive Parameter Generation**: The design of adaptive parameter generation needs careful consideration to maintain stability, as noted in the analysis. Integrating gated mechanisms and adaptive updates, as seen in Griffin and TTT models, can be a promising direction.\n\nBy leveraging these recent developments and insights, researchers can design more efficient, adaptive, and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

On the one hand, Dong et al. [6] and Noci et al. [19] initiated the discussion of attention localization and theoretically showed that a network with self-attention layers without skip connections exponentially loses the rank of hidden layers; the fact indicates that the model expressivity shall be immediately lost with more self-attention layers stacked. On the other hand, Zhai et al. [31] empirically found that attention entropy-averaged Shannon entropy of an attention probability matrix-correlates with training stability. Specifically, a training loss curve tends to fall into a plateau when attention entropy is low. Since higher entropy indicates near-uniform attention weights, their finding apparently suggests that localized attention may lead the learning dynamics to a plateau. Up until now, these two failure modes have been discussed independently with slightly different notions of attention localization, and hence, our understanding of the blessing and curse of attention localization remains elusive. To better comprehend, we characterize self-attention patterns by attention parameter matrices to reconcile the two collapse modes. We formulate the concept of localization by signal propagation probability (Section 3), which describes how likely the signal of a specific input token propagates to the gradient of a training objective. If the signal propagation probability is high for a few numbers of tokens only, attention is regarded to be localized. We show that the localization mode can be characterized by the eigenspectrum of attention weight matrices (Section 4). Specifically, attention is localized in the above sense when the eigenspectrum of the query-key parameter matrix has a non-zero mean and a small variance. Furthermore, the small eigenspectrum variance is relevant to both the rank collapse and entropy collapse (Section 5), and thus, we give a unified perspective of the two notions of attention collapse. For this reason, we argue that attention collapse and its performance can be viewed more transparently based on the eigenspectrum variance. Lastly, we verified the correlation of the eigenspectrum and the model performance in the experiments with the WikiText dataset [16] by introducing a regularization scheme called LocAteR.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 44/74 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). 2023.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Continual Pre-training of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Zixuan Ke, Yijia Shao, Haowei Lin, Tatsuya Konishi, Gyuhak Kim, Bin Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method to continually DAP-train an LM with a sequence of unlabeled domain corpora to adapt the LM to these domains to improve their end-task performances and contrasts the representations of the previously learned domain knowledge to achieve knowledge integration.\n\n**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) have been instrumental for the rapid advance of natural language processing. This paper studies continual pre-training of LMs, in particular, continual domain-adaptive pre-training (or continual DAP-training). Existing research has shown that further pre-training an LM using a domain corpus to adapt the LM to the domain can improve the end-task performance in the domain. This paper proposes a novel method to continually DAP-train an LM with a sequence of unlabeled domain corpora to adapt the LM to these domains to improve their end-task performances. The key novelty of our method is a soft-masking mechanism that directly controls the update to the LM. A novel proxy is also proposed to preserve the general knowledge in the original LM. Additionally, it contrasts the representations of the previously learned domain knowledge (including the general knowledge in the pre-trained LM) and the knowledge from the current full network to achieve knowledge integration. The method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting, but also achieves knowledge transfer to improve end-task performances. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 90  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. Bag of Tricks for Training Data Extraction from Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Weichen Yu, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Chao Du, Bingyi Kang, Yan Huang, Min Lin, Shuicheng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction, and proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** With the advance of language models, privacy protection is receiving more attention. Training data extraction is therefore of great importance, as it can serve as a potential tool to assess privacy leakage. However, due to the difficulty of this task, most of the existing methods are proof-of-concept and still not effective enough. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction. Based on the GPT-Neo 1.3B evaluation results, our proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research.

Exploring the Limits of Domain-Adaptive Training for Detoxifying Large-Scale Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Boxin Wang, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, P. Xu, M. Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bo Li, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore domain-adaptive training to reduce the toxicity of language models and demonstrates that adding and training adapter-only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for the large-scale models.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (LMs) are shown to easily generate toxic language. In this work, we systematically explore domain-adaptive training to reduce the toxicity of language models. We conduct this study on three dimensions: training corpus, model size, and parameter efficiency. For the training corpus, we propose to leverage the generative power of LMs and generate nontoxic datasets for domain-adaptive training, which mitigates the exposure bias and is shown to be more data-efficient than using a curated pre-training corpus. We demonstrate that the self-generation method consistently outperforms the existing baselines across various model sizes on both automatic and human evaluations, even when it uses a 1/3 smaller training corpus. We then comprehensively study detoxifying LMs with parameter sizes ranging from 126M up to 530B (3x larger than GPT-3), a scale that has never been studied before. We find that i) large LMs have similar toxicity levels as smaller ones given the same pre-training corpus, and ii) large LMs require more endeavor to detoxify. We also explore parameter-efficient training methods for detoxification. We demonstrate that adding and training adapter-only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for the large-scale models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Federated Learning of Large Language Models with Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning and Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Tianshi Che, Ji Liu, Yang Zhou, Jiaxiang Ren, Jiwen Zhou, Victor S. Sheng, H. Dai, D. Dou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs and a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*PengFei Liu, Junlong Li, Yikai Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability beyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in downstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend LLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and GPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are resource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their applicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention entropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain stability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting RoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently adapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6 training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore how data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension for specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy conversations as a good starting point.

LLMs Can Evolve Continually on Modality for X-Modal Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Long Chen, You He, Huchuan Lu, Dong Wang, Lanqing Hong, Yunzhi Zhuge, Haiwen Diao, Lu Zhang, Haomiao Xiong, Jiazuo Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, existing methods rely heavily on extensive modal-specific pretraining and joint-modal tuning, leading to significant computational burdens when expanding to new modalities. In this paper, we propose PathWeave, a flexible and scalable framework with modal-Path sWitching and ExpAnsion abilities that enables MLLMs to continually EVolve on modalities for $\\mathbb{X}$-modal reasoning. We leverage the concept of Continual Learning and develop an incremental training strategy atop pre-trained MLLMs, enabling their expansion to new modalities using uni-modal data, without executing joint-modal pretraining. In detail, a novel Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework is introduced, in which uni-modal and cross-modal adapters are seamlessly integrated to facilitate efficient modality alignment and collaboration. Additionally, an MoE-based gating module is applied between two types of adapters to further enhance the multimodal interaction. To investigate the proposed method, we establish a challenging benchmark called Continual Learning of Modality (MCL), which consists of high-quality QA data from five distinct modalities: image, video, audio, depth and point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AnA framework on learning plasticity and memory stability during continual learning. Furthermore, PathWeave performs comparably to state-of-the-art MLLMs while concurrently reducing parameter training burdens by 98.73%.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention language models*\n\n*Josh Susskind, Jiatao Gu, Yizhe Zhang, Jason Ramapuram, Dan Busbridge, Etai Littwin, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Shuangfei Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

It introduces the ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (StRing) method, which enhances the performance of LLMs by addressing the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions. This method improves the effective context length without additional training, which can contribute to better training stability.\n\n## Convergence Analysis of Test-Time Training\n\n- The work on \"DynaMo\" by Tuli et al. (2024) involves dynamic multi-token prediction, which includes adaptive thresholding and co-occurrence weighted masking. This approach demonstrates successful test-time training with dynamic parameter updates, achieving a significant speed-up while maintaining quality. The paper highlights the feasibility and benefits of dynamic parameter updates during inference, which is crucial for maintaining performance and efficiency.\n\n## Techniques for Maintaining Stability in Dynamic Parameter Updates\n\n- The \"DEER\" method by Liang et al. (2023) combines non-autoregressive (NAR) generation with dynamic parameter pruning techniques. This approach allows for flexible control over decoding iteration steps and model sizes, showing effectiveness in maintaining performance while adapting parameters dynamically. This technique is important for balancing adaptivity with computational cost and ensuring stability during dynamic updates.\n\n## Integration of Selective Attention with Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\" (RAG) and its variants, such as \"Self-RAG\" and \"RECOMP,\" involve integrating selective attention mechanisms with adaptive retrieval and generation processes. For instance, \"Self-RAG\" uses a critic model to generate reflection tokens that help in deciding whether external passages are needed, and a generator model that leverages these reflections. This integration enhances the model's ability to selectively focus on relevant information, improving overall performance and stability.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory Management and Efficiency**: Papers like \"CORM\" by Dai et al. (2024) emphasize the importance of memory management in large language models. Optimizing KV cache usage and employing block-based processing can significantly reduce the memory footprint, which is crucial for maintaining stability and efficiency during adaptive updates.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: While not explicitly covered in the provided sources, the future search plan suggests investigating hardware optimization techniques to further enhance the stability and efficiency of adaptive attention mechanisms in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more robust and efficient autoregressive language models that leverage adaptive attention mechanisms, maintain stability during dynamic parameter updates, and optimize memory usage for better overall performance.\n",
