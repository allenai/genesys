Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.47)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Structural Entropy Guided Graph Hierarchical Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Structural State-Space Models*\n\n*Junran Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Ke Xu, Shangzhe Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, and a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once, which outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of convolution on non-Euclidean space, the corresponding pooling approaches have also been validated on various tasks regarding graphs. However, because of the fixed compression quota and stepwise pooling design, these hierarchical pooling methods still suffer from local structure damage and suboptimal problem. In this work, inspired by structural entropy, we propose a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, to tackle the two issues. Specifically, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once. Then, we present an illustration of the local structure damage from previous methods in the reconstruction of ring and grid synthetic graphs. In addition to SEP, we further design two classification models, SEP-G and SEP-N for graph classification and node classification, respectively. The results show that SEP outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Accelerating Toeplitz Neural Network with Constant-time Inference Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting Toeplitz Neural Networks to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling Tnns to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) have exhibited outstanding performance in various sequence modeling tasks. They outperform commonly used Transformer-based models while benefiting from log-linear space-time complexities. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) achieve lower performance than TNNs in language modeling but offer the advantage of constant inference complexity. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this, we formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution. We demonstrate how to transform the target equation into a Vandermonde linear system problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Notably, our method requires no training and maintains numerical stability. It can be also applied to any LongConv-based model. To assess its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on language modeling tasks across various settings. Additionally, we compare our method to other gradient-descent solutions, highlighting the superior numerical stability of our approach.

Newton-Cotes Graph Neural Networks: On the Time Evolution of Dynamic Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks*\n\n*Lingbing Guo, Wei-Qun Wang, Zhuo Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Zequn Sun, Yixuan Lai, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new approach to predict the integration based on several velocity estimations with Newton-Cotes formulas is proposed and proved theoretically and empirically consistent and significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning system dynamics is one of the most important analytical approaches for many scientific studies. With the initial state of a system as input, the recent graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods are capable of predicting the future state distant in time with high accuracy. Although these methods have diverse designs in modeling the coordinates and interacting forces of the system, we show that they actually share a common paradigm that learns the integration of the velocity over the interval between the initial and terminal coordinates. However, their integrand is constant w.r.t. time. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new approach to predict the integration based on several velocity estimations with Newton-Cotes formulas and prove its effectiveness theoretically. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks empirically demonstrate consistent and significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Liquid Structural State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Structural State-Space Models*\n\n*Daniela Rus, Alexander Amini, Makram Chahine, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Mathias Lechner, Ramin Hasani*\n\n**Abstract:** A proper parametrization of state transition matrices of linear state-space models (SSMs) followed by standard nonlinearities enables them to efficiently learn representations from sequential data, establishing the state-of-the-art on a large series of long-range sequence modeling benchmarks. In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Structural State-Space Models*\n\n*Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, Badri Narayana Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

Liquid Time-constant Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks*\n\n*Alexander Amini, Radu Grosu, Daniela Rus, Ramin Hasani, Mathias Lechner*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models. Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities, we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs.

Discrete Event, Continuous Time RNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks*\n\n*Michael C. Mozer, Denis Kazakov, Robert V. Lindsey*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate recurrent neural network architectures for event-sequence\nprocessing. Event sequences, characterized by discrete observations stamped\nwith continuous-valued times of occurrence, are challenging due to the\npotentially wide dynamic range of relevant time scales as well as interactions\nbetween time scales. We describe four forms of inductive bias that should\nbenefit architectures for event sequences: temporal locality, position and\nscale homogeneity, and scale interdependence. We extend the popular gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) architecture to incorporate these biases via intrinsic\ntemporal dynamics, obtaining a continuous-time GRU. The CT-GRU arises by\ninterpreting the gates of a GRU as selecting a time scale of memory, and the\nCT-GRU generalizes the GRU by incorporating multiple time scales of memory and\nperforming context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage\nand retrieval. Event time-stamps drive decay dynamics of the CT-GRU, whereas\nthey serve as generic additional inputs to the GRU. Despite the very different\nmanner in which the two models consider time, their performance on eleven data\nsets we examined is essentially identical. Our surprising results point both to\nthe robustness of GRU and LSTM architectures for handling continuous time, and\nto the potency of incorporating continuous dynamics into neural architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating Liquid Structural State-Space Models (Liquid S4) into the FastTTTLinear GAU for enhanced language modeling, here are the key points and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Goal and Intent\nThe researcher aims to improve the FastTTTLinear GAU by incorporating concepts from Liquid S4 models.

The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLearning representations from sequences of data requires expressive temporal and structural credit assignment. In this space, the continuous-time neural network class of liquid time-constant networks (LTC) (Hasani et al., 2021b) has shown theoretical and empirical evidence for their expressivity and their ability to capture the cause and effect of a given task from high-dimensional sequential demonstrations (Lechner et al., 2020a; Vorbach et al., 2021). Liquid networks are nonlinear state-space models (SSMs) with an input-dependent state transition module that enables them to learn to adapt the dynamics of the model to incoming inputs, at inference, as they are dynamic causal models (Friston et al., 2003). Their complexity, however, is bottlenecked by their differential equation numerical solver that limits their scalability to longer-term sequences. How can we take advantage of LTC's generalization and causality capabilities and scale them to competitively learn long-range sequences without gradient issues, compared to advanced recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Erichson et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2020a; Rusch and Mishra, 2021), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Cheng et al., 2022; Lea et al., 2016; Romero et al., 2021b), and attention-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017)? In this work, we set out to leverage the elegant formulation of structural state-space models (S4) (Gu et al., 2022a) to obtain linear liquid network instances that possess the approximation capabilities of both S4 and LTCs. This is because structural SSMs are shown to largely dominate advanced RNNs, CNNs, and\n\n[^0]Transformers across many data modalities such as text, sequence of pixels, audio, and time series (Gu et al., 2021, 2022a,b; Gupta, 2022). Structural SSMs achieve such impressive performance by using three main mechanisms: 1) High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020a) that are applied to state and input transition matrices to memorize signals' history, 2) diagonal plus low-rank parametrization of the obtained HiPPO (Gu et al., 2022a), and 3) an efficient (convolution) kernel computation of an SSM's transition matrices in the frequency domain, transformed back in time via an inverse Fourier transformation (Gu et al., 2022a). To combine S4 and LTCs, instead of modeling sequences by linear state-space models of the form $\\dot{x}=$ A $x+\\mathbf{B} u, y=\\mathbf{C} x$, (as done in structural and diagonal SSMs ( Gu et al., 2022a,b), we propose to use a linearized LTC state-space model (Hasani et al., 2021b), given by the following dynamics: $\\dot{x}=(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B} u) x+$ B $u, y=\\mathbf{C} x$. We show that this dynamical system can also be efficiently solved via the same parametrization of S4, giving rise to an additional convolutional Kernel that accounts for the similarities of lagged signals. We call the obtained model Liquid-S4. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that Liquid-S4 consistently leads to better generalization performance compared to all variants of S4, CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers across many time-series modeling tasks. In particular, we achieve SOTA performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020b) with an average of $87.32 \\%$. To sum up, we make the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce Liquid-S4, a new state-space model that encapsulates the generalization and causality capabilities of liquid networks as well as the memorization, efficiency and scalability of S4. 2. We achieve State-of-the-art performance on pixel-level sequence classification, text, speech recognition and all six tasks of the long-range arena benchmark with an average accuracy of $87.32 \\%$. On the full raw Speech Command recognition dataset Liquid-S4 achieves $96.78 \\%$ accuracy with $30 \\%$ reduction in parameter.

Sequence modeling can be performed autoregressively with RNNs which possess persistent states (Little, 1974) originated from Ising (Brush, 1967) and Hopfield networks (Hopfield, 1982; Ramsauer et al., 2020). Discrete RNNs approximate continuous dynamics stepby-steps via dependencies on the history of their hidden states, and continuous-time (CT) RNNs use ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers to unroll their dynamics with more elaborate temporal steps (Funahashi and Nakamura, 1993). CT-RNNs can perform remarkable credit assignment in sequence modeling problems both on regularly sampled, irregularly-sampled data (Amig\u00f3 et al., 2012; Belletti et al., 2016; Foster, 1996; Kowal et al., 2019; Li and Marlin, 2016; Pearson et al., 2003; Roy and Yan, 2020), by turning the spatiotemproal dependencies into vector fields (Chen et al., 2018), enabling better generalization and expressivity (Hasani et al., 2021b; Massaroli et al., 2020). Numerous works have studied their characteristics to understand their applicability and limitations in learning sequential data and flows (Dupont et al., 2019; Durkan et al., 2019; Gruenbacher et al., 2022; Grunbacher et al., 2021; Hanshu et al., 2020; Hasani et al., 2020; Holl et al., 2020; Jia and Benson, 2019; Kidger et al., 2020; Lechner et al., 2019; Liebenwein et al., 2021; Quaglino et al., 2020). However, when these RNNs are trained by gradient descent (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2019; Rumelhart et al., 1986; Sherstinsky, 2020), they suffer from the vanishing/exploding gradients problem, which makes difficult the learning of long-term dependencies in sequences (Bengio et al., 1994; Hochreiter, 1991). This issue happens in both discrete RNNs such as GRU-D with its continuous delay mechanism (Che et al., 2018) and PhasedLSTMs (Neil et al., 2016), and continuous RNNs such as ODE-RNNs (Rubanova et al., 2019), GRU-ODE (De Brouwer et al., 2019), Log-ODE methods (Morrill et al., 2020) which compresses the input time-series by\ntime-continuous path signatures (Friz and Victoir, 2010), and neural controlled differential equations (Kidger et al., 2020), and liquid time-constant networks (LTCs) (Hasani et al., 2021b). Numerous solutions have been proposed to resolve these gradient issues to enable long-range dependency learning. Examples include discrete gating mechanisms in LSTMs (Greff et al., 2016; Hasani et al., 2019; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), GRUs (Chung et al., 2014), continuous gating mechanisms such as CfCs (Hasani et al., 2021a), hawks LSTMs (Mei and Eisner, 2017), IndRNNs (Li et al., 2018), state regularization (Wang and Niepert, 2019), unitary RNNs (Jing et al., 2019), dilated RNNs (Chang et al., 2017), long memory stochastic processes (Greaves-Tunnell and Harchaoui, 2019), recurrent kernel networks (Chen et al., 2019), Lipschitz RNNs (Erichson et al., 2021), symmetric skew decomposition (Wisdom et al., 2016), infinitely many updates in iRNNs (Kag et al., 2019), coupled oscillatory RNNs (coRNNs) (Rusch and Mishra, 2021), mixedmemory RNNs (Lechner and Hasani, 2021), and Legendre Memory Units (Voelker et al., 2019). Learning Long-range Dependencies with CNNs and Transformers. RNNs are not the only solution to learning long-range dependencies. Continuous convolutional kernels such as CKConv (Romero et al., 2021b) and (Romero et al., 2021a), and circular dilated CNNs (Cheng et al., 2022) have shown to be efficient in modeling long sequences faster than RNNs. There has also been a large series of works showing the effectiveness of attention-based methods for modeling spatiotemporal data. A large list of these models is listed in Table $\\mathbf{1}$. These baselines have recently been largely outperformed by the structural state-space models (Gu et al., 2022a). State-Space Models. SSMs are well-established frameworks to study deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems (KALMAN, 1960). Their state and input transition matrices can be directly learned by gradient descent to model sequences of observations (Gu et al., 2021; Hasani et al., 2021b; Lechner et al., 2020b). In a seminal work, Gu et al. (2022a) showed that with a couple of fundamental algorithmic methods on memorization and computation of input sequences, SSMs can turn into the most powerful sequence modeling framework to-date, outperforming advanced RNNs, temporal and continuous CNNs (Cheng et al., 2022; Romero et al., 2021a,b) and a wide variety of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), available in Table $\\mathbf{1}$ by a significant margin. The key to their success is their diagonal plus-low rank parameterization of the transition matrix of SSMs via higher-order polynomial projection (HiPPO) matrix (Gu et al., 2020a) obtained by a scaled Legendre measure (LegS) inspired by the Legendre Memory Units (Voelker et al., 2019) to memorize input sequences, a learnable input transition matrix, and an efficient Cauchy Kernel algorithm, results in obtaining structural SSMs named S4. It was also shown recently that diagonal SSMs (S4D) (Gupta, 2022) could be as performant as S4 in learning long sequences when parametrized and initialized properly (Gu et al., 2022b,c). There was also a new variant of S4 introduced as simplified-S4 (S5) Smith et al. (2022) that tensorizes the 1-D operations of S4 to gain a more straightforward realization of SSMs. Here, we introduce Liquid-S4, which is obtained by a more expressive SSM, namely liquid time-constant (LTC) representation (Hasani et al., 2021b) which achieves SOTA performance across many benchmarks. ## 3. Setup and Methodology\n\nIn this section, we first revisit the necessary background to formulate our Liquid Structural State-Space Models. We then set up and sketch our technical contributions. ### 3.1. Background\n\nWe aim to design an end-to-end sequence modeling framework built by SSMs. A continuous-time SSM representation of a linear dynamical system is given by the following set of equations:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)+\\mathbf{D} u(t) . $$\n\nHere, $x(t)$ is an $N$-dimensional latent state, receiving a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$, and computing a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t) . \\mathbf{A}^{(N \\times N)}, \\mathbf{B}^{(N \\times 1)}, \\mathbf{C}^{(1 \\times N)}$ and $\\mathbf{D}^{(1 \\times 1)}$ are system's parameters. For the sake of brevity, throughout our analysis, we set $\\mathbf{D}=0$ as it can be added eventually after construction of our main results in the form of a skip connection (Gu et al., 2022a). Discretization of SSMs. In order to create a sequence-to-sequence model similar to a recurrent neural network (RNN), we discretize the continuous-time representation of SSMs by the trapezoidal rule (bilinear transform) ${ }^{\\dagger}$ as follows (sampling step $=\\delta t$ ) (Gu et al., 2022a):\n\n$$\nx_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k}\n$$\n\nThis is obtained via the following modifications to the transition matrices:\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\frac{\\delta t}{2} \\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{I}+\\frac{\\delta t}{2} \\mathbf{A}\\right), \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\frac{\\delta t}{2} \\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1} \\delta t \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n$$\n\nWith this transformation, we constructed a discretized seq-2-seq model that can map the input $u_{k}$ to output $y_{k}$, via the hidden state $x_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. $\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}$ is the hidden transition matrix, $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ and $\\overline{\\mathbf{C}}$ are input and output transition matrices, respectively. Creating a Convolutional Representation of SSMs. The system described by (2) and (3), can be trained via gradient descent to learn to model sequences, in a sequential manner which is not scalable. To improve this, we can write the discretized SSM in (2) as a discrete convolutional kernel. To construct the convolutional kernel, let us unroll the system (2) in time as follows, assuming a zero initial hidden states $x_{-1}=0$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{0}=\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}, \\quad x_{1}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}, \\quad x_{2}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}, \\quad \\ldots \\\\\n& y_{0}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} \\mathbf{B} u_{0}, \\quad y_{1}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}} \\mathbf{B} u_{0}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{1}, \\quad y_{2}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}} \\mathbf{B} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{2}, \\quad \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe mapping $u_{k} \\rightarrow y_{k}$ can now can be formulated into a convolutional kernel explicitly:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\ldots \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} u_{k,} \\quad y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u \\\\\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}:=\\mathcal{K}_{L}(\\overline{\\mathbf{C}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}):=(\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}})_{i \\in[L]}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\ldots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}{ }^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nEquation (5) is a non-circular convolutional kernel. Gu et al. (2022a) showed that under the condition that $\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}$ is known, it could be solved very efficiently by a black-box Cauchy kernel computation pipeline. ### 3.2. Liquid Structural State-Space Models\n\nIn this work, we construct a convolutional kernel corresponding to a linearized version of LTCs (Hasani et al., 2021b); an expressive class of continuous-time neural networks that demonstrate attractive generalizability outof-distribution and are dynamic causal models (Friston et al., 2003; Hasani et al., 2020; Vorbach et al., 2021). [^1]In their general form, the state of a liquid time-constant network at each time-step is given by the set of ODEs described below (Hasani et al., 2021b):\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{x}(t)}{d t}=-\\underbrace{[\\boldsymbol{A}+\\boldsymbol{B} \\odot f(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t, \\theta)]}_{\\text {Liquid time-constant }} \\odot \\mathbf{x}(t)+\\boldsymbol{B} \\odot f(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t, \\theta)\n$$\n\nIn this expression, $\\mathbf{x}^{(N \\times 1)}(t)$ is the vector of hidden state of size $N, \\mathbf{u}^{(m \\times 1)}(t)$ is an input signal with $m$ features, $\\boldsymbol{A}^{(N \\times 1)}$ is a time-constant state-transition mechanism, $\\boldsymbol{B}^{(N \\times 1)}$ is a bias vector, and $\\odot$ represents the Hadamard product. $f($.$) is a bounded nonlinearity parametrized by \\theta$. Our objective is to show how the liquid time-constant (i.e., an input-dependent state transition mechanism in state-space models can enhance its generalization capabilities by accounting for the covariance of the input samples. To do this, we linearize the LTC formulation of Eq. 7 in the following to better connect the model to SSMs. Let's dive in:\nLinear Liquid Time-Constant State-Space Model. A Linear LTC SSM can be presented by the following coupled bilinear (first order bilinear Taylor approximation (Penny et al., 2005)) equation:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t)=[\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B} u(t)] x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nSimilar to (1), $x(t)$ is an $N$-dimensional latent state, receiving a 1 -dimensional input signal $u(t)$, and computing a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t) .\n```\n\n#### 2.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/27 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nThis allows to remove a mixing layer present in the postprocessing of the S4 and S4D output. ## D. Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU)\n\nThe LRU model attempts to simplify previous SSM proposals by unveiling their essential components. One of the main contributions of LRU is to explicitly encode long-range memory through eigenvalues. This allows to move away from the HiPPO theory and directly use a discrete-time model together with concepts of marginal stability from control theory. a) Parameterization: The LRU model directly parameterizes the discrete-time dynamics (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=e^{-e^{\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)}+i \\operatorname{idiag}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{p}\\right)}, \\quad \\bar{B}=e^{\\gamma} \\Gamma\n$$\n\nwith $i$ the complex unit, $\\lambda_{j}, \\theta_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R} \\forall j=1, \\ldots, p, \\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p \\times q}$ a dense complex-valued matrix, and $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Notice that this parameterization directly represents the diagonal entries of $\\bar{A}$, and therefore the eigenvalues in polar coordinates, i.e. $a_{j}=$ $r_{j}+i \\theta_{j}$ where $r_{j}=e^{-e^{\\lambda_{j}}}$, is constrained to the interval $[0,1]$ by construction. This is also the first parameterization that does not have shared parameters between $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$. b) Discretization: The LRU model is the first of the SSMs that is not seen as a discretization of a continuous-time model. Instead, a discrete parametrization of $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ is directly used. c) Structure and Initialization: The structure of the model is identical to S5, where a MIMO system -as opposed to $q$ SISO subsystems- is considered. Given the parametrization 10p, Lemma 2.2 is automatically enforced by constraining the eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}$ to lie in the unitdisk. Hence, the initialization is directly performed in polar coordinates by defining a range for $r$ and $\\theta$ in which $r$ and $\\theta$ are uniformly sampled, resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2\nd) Implementation: Similar to LRU, the model is implemented using a parallel scan algorithm [16] for both training and inference. e) Scaffolding: The scaffolding used in LRU is identical to the one used in S 5 . ## E. Scan Selective Structured State Space Sequence Model (S6)\n\nThe S6 parametrization [10] introduces for the first time a linear time-varying representation of the dynamics (3). The time-varying nature of the system stems from the matrices $\\bar{A}_{k}, \\bar{B}_{k}$ and $\\bar{C}_{k}$ being functions of the input $u(k)$ at every timestep $k$, which the authors refer to as selectivity. Although more expressive, the time-varying representation presents computational challenges. The main contribution of this paper is to address those so the more expressive time-varying nature of the system can be exploited in practice. a) Parametrization: Similar to S4D, the S6 parametrization relies on a time-invariant diagonal $A$ matrix (8) as per Assumption 2.1. The novelty of the S6 parametrization is that $B$ and $C$ are parameterized to be time-varying given their input-dependent nature:\n\n$$\nB_{k}=W_{B} u(k) \\quad C_{k}=W_{C} u(k)\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{B}$ and $W_{C}$ are linear projection matrices of appropriate dimensions. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-6.jpg?height=467&width=1781&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=172)\n\nFig. 2: Complex plane representation of the unit disk and the eigenvalues of discrete-time dynamics matrix $\\bar{A}$ (4) resulting from the initialization method in each of the models S4, S4D, S5, LRU, S6, and RG-LRU. Since the initialization of S6 and RG-LRU are input dependent, we plot the initialization for two sample inputs (blue and orange). b) Discretization: Similar to S4D, the S6 model also uses exact discretization to compute the discrete-time dynamics (4). However, in this case the time-step $\\Delta_{k}$ is itself time-varying since it is a function of the input\n$\\Delta_{k}=\\sigma\\left(W_{\\Delta} u(k)\\right), \\quad \\bar{A}_{k}=e^{\\Delta_{k} A}, \\quad \\bar{B}_{k}=\\left(\\Delta_{k} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\bar{A}_{k}-I\\right) \\Delta_{k} B_{k}$,\n$\\bar{C}_{k}=C_{k}$ and $\\bar{D}_{k}=D_{k}$, with $W_{\\Delta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$ and $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ the softplus function. c) Structure and Initialization: Similar to S5, the model is structured in a MIMO manner. In order to initialize the dynamic matrix $A$, its diagonal parametrization is exploited: $\\lambda_{i}=-i \\forall i=1, \\ldots, p$, ensuring that the eigenvalues lie in the negative halfplane. Due to the time-varying nature of the discretization step $\\Delta_{k}$, the eigenvalues of the discrete-time matrices $\\bar{A}_{k}$ have an initialization that is input-dependent as depicted in Figure 2 However, in order to enforce Lemma 2.2 the resulting eigenvalues are guaranteed to lie in the unit disk since $\\Delta_{k}$ and $A$ in (12) are positive and negative, respectively. d) Implementation: One of the main contributions of the work in [10] is to provide an efficient implementation of the time-varying dynamics (4) with matrices (11) and 12 both at inference and training time. In general, the timevarying nature of the S 6 model renders the convolutional representation too computationally expensive for practical use. To overcome these limitations, the S6 paper presents a highly customized variation of the parallel scan algorithm [16] for both training and inference. e) Scaffolding: Another innovation of the work in [10] is the introduction of a new scaffolding: the Mamba scaffolding. Here, the pre-processing relies on both linear and nonlinear maps. The map of the upper signal (linear map) is a linear projection followed by a causal convolution, while the map of the lower signal (nonlinear map) is a linear projection followed by a SiLU nonlinearity. The post-processing is once again a gating function similar to previous scaffolding proposals. ## F. Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU)\n\nThe RG-LRU model is a derivative of the well-known long short-term memory (LSTM) model [27] and therefore offers a different perspective on SSM models. The RG-LRU model fuses ideas from LSTMs, LRU, and S6. a) Parametrization: Following S6, RG-LRU also relies on a time-varying parametrization of the linear dynamics. However, while all previous SSM proposals rely on output feedback dynamics, the RG-LRU model introduces for the first time a state feedback model where $C$ and $D$ are not present. The $A$ and $B$ matrices are then parameterized as\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{k}=e^{-c \\phi\\left(W_{A}\\right) \\sigma\\left(W_{\\Delta} u(k)\\right)}, \\quad \\bar{B}_{k}=\\sqrt{1-A_{k}^{2}} \\sigma\\left(W_{B} u(k)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{\\Delta}, W_{A}, W_{B}$ are linear projection matrices of appropriate dimensions, $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar constant ${ }_{4}^{4} \\phi(\\cdot)$ is the softplus function, and $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function. The operation $\\sqrt{1-A_{k}^{2}}$ is computed element-wise for each entry of $A_{k}$. b) Discretization: Similar to the LRU model, the RGLRU model does not rely on a continuous-time representation and instead directly parametrizes the discrete matrices $\\bar{A}_{k}, \\bar{B}_{k}$. c) Structure and Initialization: Similar to LRU, the RG-LRU model is structured as a MIMO system. Taking inspiration from LSTMs, this models assumes the state dimension to be equal to the input dimension, i.e., $p=q$. The linear projection matrices $W_{\\Delta}, W_{A}, W_{B}$ are initialized with standard initialization methods, e.g. Glorot [14], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2 Given the parameterization of $\\bar{A}_{k}$ in 13), its eigenvalues are restricted to the unit disk by construction. d) Implementation: Due to the time-varying nature of the RG-LRU model, it faces the same challenges as the S6 model. Therefore, it also uses a customized variation of the parallel scan algorithm [16] to compute the outputs at both training and inference time. e) Scaffolding: The RG-LRU model uses the same scaffolding as the S6 model, Mamba. However, this work also introduces two additional task-specific scaffoldings around the basic Mamba scaffolding that are tailored to language modelling: Hawk and Griffin [21, Section 2].

The first entry (Random) represents the performance of random guessing on the task, i.e., indicating the baseline above which a model is considered to have learned a meaningful representation. Models failing to exceed this baseline on a task are marked as FAIL. The best model on each task is highlighted in bold. ## IV. Performance in Practice\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the SSM proposals reviewed in Section III on the long-range arena (LRA) benchmark [2]. This benchmark evaluates the models in terms of their reasoning ability and their handling of diverse data types, which is one of the strengths of SSMs. We first introduce the benchmark, before presenting the empirical evaluation. ## A. Long-Range Arena (LRA) Benchmark\n\nThe goal of the LRA benchmark is to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of sequence models in diverse ways. The benchmark consists of 5 different tasks, which we summarize in the following. For more details on the benchmark and the individual tasks, we refer to [2]. a) List Operations (ListOps): This task evaluates a model's ability to capture hierarchical dependencies over long contexts. The goal is to predict the result of a mathematical operation consisting of nested mean, median, max, and $\\min$ operations ${ }^{5}$ The task is a ten-way classification task with maximal input lengths of 2 k . b) Text Classification (Text): This task evaluates a model's ability to capture the tone of long tokenized texts. The dataset consists of IMDb movie reviews, which need to be classified as negative or positive in tone. The task is a binary classification task with maximal input lengths of 4 k . c) Document Retrieval (Retrieval): This task evaluates a model's ability to compress long sequences into representations that are suitable for similarity matching. The dataset consists of tokenized papers published by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), which need to be classified in having a citation link or not. The task is a binary classification task with maximal input lengths of 8 k . d) Image Classification (Image): This task evaluates a model's ability to learn 2D spatial relations from a 1D vector. The dataset consists of vectorized images, which depict one of ten possible classes, e.g. a horse or a car. The task is a ten-way classification task with maximal input lengths of 1 k . [^4]e) Long-Range Spacial Dependency: This task evaluates a model's ability to learn spacial dependencies in a vectorized image. The dataset consists of images, which depict two circles and multiple dashed paths. The goal is to evaluate whether the two circles are connected by any of the present paths or not. The task is therefore a binary classification task and is divided into two subtasks, which only differ in the size of the image. The first subtask has inputs of length 2 k and we will refer to it as Pathfinder; the second subtask has a maximal input length of 16 k and we will refer to it as Path-X. ## B. Empirical Evaluation of SSM Proposals\n\nThe empirical performance of the reviewed SSM proposals, the Transformer [1], and random guessing are reported in Table II We include the performance of the Transformer as a baseline, since they are the dominant architecture in large language models and sequence modelling. For S4, S4D, S5, and LRU we report the performance of the best variant from the original papers in order to present the most competitive results. Other variants of these models might perform better on tasks not included in the LRA benchmark; for more details on these variants we refer to the original papers. Since performance on the LRA benchmark of S6 and RGLRU have not been reported in the literature, we provide the results of our own implementation of these architectures, which we make available here ${ }^{6}$ The hyperparameters of the models and training details of our implementation are stated in the public code repository. On the LRA benchmark, the LTI-based models S4, S4D, S5, LRU outperform the LTV-based models S6, RG-LRU and the Transformer. From a control theoretic perspective this is surprising, since a general LTV definition encompasses LTI systems as a special case, i.e., a LTV system should perform at least as well as a LTI system. However, this is not the case for the particular time-varying parametrization of S6 or RG-LRU, since e.g. $\\bar{A}=\\bar{A}_{k} \\forall k$ cannot be achieved. We attempted to improve the performance of the LTV-based\n\n[^5]models by changing the initialization of S6 and RG-LRU and forcing the input-dependent eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}_{k} \\forall k$ closer to marginal stability according to Lemma 2.2 However, this resulted in both models to perform considerably worse or fail to learn anything meaningful at all. While marginally stable eigenvalues appear to be important for the LTI-based models, the same is not true for LTV-based models. To date, this behavior is not well understood. Lastly, even though the LTVbased models are closely related to the Transformer [28], they generally perform better on the LRA benchmark. ## V. CONCLUSION AND Future Opportunities\n\nIn this paper, we have provided an overview of stateof-the-art state space models (SSM) and explored their features from a control theoretic perspective. In doing this, we highlighted the many connections to standard control theoretic concepts such as the connection between memory and marginal-stability. Additionally, we compared the reviewed SSMs on the long-range arena (LRA) benchmark, finding that the more recent LTV-based SSMs perform worse than their LTI-based counterparts. From a control theoretic perspective, this raises many interesting research questions concerning a LTV parametrization that attains the same performance as the LTI models, as well as a deeper understanding on the role of the eigenvalues in the LTVbased models. SSMs, particularly the LTV versions, rely on dynamics where the dynamic matrices depend on the input (excitation) to the system. However, in the SSM literature the theoretical properties arising from these dynamics remains poorly understood. The evident connections between SSMs and linearsystem theory give rise to ample opportunities to provide explainability to large foundational models. Moreover, as seen with the LRU model, control theoretic insights have the potential to inform better designs for SSMs.\n```\n\n#### 3. Structured state-space models are deep Wiener models (Avg.

Sch\u00f6n*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides a system identification-friendly introduction to the Structured State-space Models (SSMs), and highlights future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.\n\n**Abstract:** The goal of this paper is to provide a system identification-friendly introduction to the Structured State-space Models (SSMs). These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form. At last, we highlight future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/22 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n(2022), and mainly involves stability promotion via regularization. To address these problems, Gu et al. (2021) proposed a Structured State-space Model (SSM) architecture named S4, which consists of multiple layers composed by LTI discrete-time systems followed by a nonlinear function. The term \"structured\" stems from the fact that this LTI system is given a specific structure to improve the architecture's modeling performances while also reducing the computational cost at training (Yu et al., 2018). Nonlinear state-space models are not new, see Marconato et al. (2013), yet their adoption has been hampered by their crucial reliance on the model structure and on the initialization method of learnable parameters. The contribution of the S4 approach towards SSMs has therefore been that of providing ( $i$ ) a novel, intrinsically stable, parametrization of the LTI system obtained by discretizing a continuoustime Diagonal Plus-Low Rank (DPLR) system, (ii) a new strategy towards the parameters' initialization problem, (iii) a computationally efficient approach to simulate (and train) these models over extremely long sequences, and (iv) an empirical proof of the state-of-the-art performances of these models in long-term sequence learning problems. Motivated by these appealing features, many works have continued to build on the S4 architecture. For example, Gupta et al. (2022) and Gu et al. (2022) have explored the benefits entailed by stricter SSM structures, namely the parametrization via diagonal continuous-time systems (S4D), and by simpler initialization strategies. Smith et al. (2022) have explored a novel, and somewhat more computationally efficient, simulation method for diagonal continuous-time parametrizations, named S5. Orvieto et al. (2023) recently investigated the parametrization of the LTI subsystems directly in the discrete time domain, resulting in the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) architecture. Contribution Despite the appealing results achieved by SSMs in the long-range arena benchmarks sequence classification problems, their use for nonlinear system identification is still unexplored. With this paper, we want to change that by making the following contributions. First of all we show that it is possible to interpret SSMs as deep Wiener models, i.e. model structures where several Wiener models are interconnected in series. An interesting note here is that even though the Wiener models have been extremely popular within system identification - see e.g. Schoukens and Tiels (2017) and references therein - their structure has been limited to \"single-layer\" or parallel architectures (Wills and Ninness, 2012). Our second contribution is to dissect the recent developments on SSMs and explain them in terms of their structure and parameterization, and to clearly separate this from their initialization, simulation, and training strategies. The presentation in the paper is also done using the language commonly used in the system identification community in order to speed up the use of these tools within this area. Notation The imaginary unit is denoted by $i=\\sqrt{-1}$. Given a vector $v$, we denote by $v^{\\prime}$ its real transpose. For a time-dependent vector, the discrete-time index $k$ is reported as a subscript, e.g., $v_{k}$. Moreover, we denote by $v_{a: b}$ (where $a \\leqslant b$ ) the sequence $v_{a: b}=\\left(v_{a}, v_{a+1}, \\ldots, v_{b}\\right)$. For this sequence, we indicate by $\\operatorname{cat}\\left(v_{a: b}\\right)$ the concatenation of its elements, i.e. $\\operatorname{cat}\\left(v_{a: b}\\right)=\\left[v_{a}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, v_{b}^{\\prime}\\right]^{\\prime}$, and by uncat $(\\cdot)$ its inverse operation returning a sequence of vectors given their concatenation. Given a complex matrix $A$, we let $\\operatorname{conj}(A)$ be its element-wise complex conjugate and $A^{*}$ be its Hermitian transpose. Diagonal matrices may be defined via the $\\operatorname{diag}$ operator, as $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$. ## 2. STRUCTURED STATE-SPACE MODELS\n\nConsider the model depicted in Figure 1, which consists of $L$ Wiener systems interconnected in series. Each of these layers is here referred to as Structured Statespace Layer (SSL). Their interconnection results in an SSM, which can be interpreted as a specific configuration of a deep Wiener system. We let the generic $\\ell$-th SSL $(\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\})$ be represented by a discrete-time statespace model\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{SSL}_{\\ell}:\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nx_{k+1}=A x_{k}+B u_{k} \\\\\n\\eta_{k}=C x_{k}+D u_{k} \\\\\ny_{k}=\\sigma\\left(\\eta_{k}\\right)+F u_{k}\n\\end{array}\\right. $$\n\nwhere, for compactness, the layer index is omitted. System (1) is characterized by the input vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{u}}$, the intermediate vector $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}$, the output vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}$, and the complex-valued state vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n_{x}}$. The SSL is parametrized by the matrices $\\{A, B, C, D, F\\}$. The output transformation $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ can be any nonlinear, Lipschitzcontinuous activation function, such as the tanh, ELU, or Swish, see Ramachandran et al. (2017). In what follows, we aim to provide an overview of the possible structure, parametrization, initialization, and simulation strategies for this SSL. Remark 1. When a deep SSM is considered $(L>1)$, each layer is parametrized and initialized independently from the others. The simulation is carried out iteratively over the set of layers, meaning that the output sequence of the $\\ell$-th layer is used as input of the layer $\\ell+1$.\n```\n\n#### 4.

What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?\n\n*From Search Query: Implementing Liquid S4 in language models*\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 82  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 3. Accelerating Toeplitz Neural Network with Constant-time Inference Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks code examples*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting Toeplitz Neural Networks to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling Tnns to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) have exhibited outstanding performance in various sequence modeling tasks. They outperform commonly used Transformer-based models while benefiting from log-linear space-time complexities. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) achieve lower performance than TNNs in language modeling but offer the advantage of constant inference complexity. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this, we formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution. We demonstrate how to transform the target equation into a Vandermonde linear system problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Notably, our method requires no training and maintains numerical stability. It can be also applied to any LongConv-based model. To assess its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on language modeling tasks across various settings. Additionally, we compare our method to other gradient-descent solutions, highlighting the superior numerical stability of our approach.

LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 5. Generating Liquid Simulations with Deformation-aware Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid Time-Constant Networks code examples*\n\n*L. Prantl, B. Bonev, N. Th\u00fcrey*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel approach for deformation-aware neural networks that learn the weighting and synthesis of dense volumetric deformation fields, and specifically targets the space-time representation of physical surfaces from liquid simulations.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel approach for deformation-aware neural networks that learn the weighting and synthesis of dense volumetric deformation fields. Our method specifically targets the space-time representation of physical surfaces from liquid simulations. Liquids exhibit highly complex, non-linear behavior under changing simulation conditions such as different initial conditions. Our algorithm captures these complex phenomena in two stages: a first neural network computes a weighting function for a set of pre-computed deformations, while a second network directly generates a deformation field for refining the surface. Key for successful training runs in this setting is a suitable loss function that encodes the effect of the deformations, and a robust calculation of the corresponding gradients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase our method with several complex examples of flowing liquids with topology changes. Our representation makes it possible to rapidly generate the desired implicit surfaces. We have implemented a mobile application to demonstrate that real-time interactions with complex liquid effects are possible with our approach.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher implement Liquid Structural State-Space Models (Liquid S4) into the FastTTTLinear GAU and address the practical implementation challenges, here are the key points and useful references:\n\n## Key Insights and Implementation Details\n\n### Input-Dependent State Transitions\nLiquid S4 models use input-dependent state transitions, which are crucial for adapting to complex temporal patterns.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/37 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models \n\nRoger Waleffe ${ }^{1,2 *}$ Wonmin Byeon ${ }^{1}$ Duncan Riach ${ }^{1}$ Brandon Norick ${ }^{1 \\dagger}$<br>Vijay Korthikanti ${ }^{1}$ Tri Dao ${ }^{3,4}$ Albert Gu ${ }^{5,6}$ Ali Hatamizadeh ${ }^{1}$ Sudhakar Singh ${ }^{1}$<br>Deepak Narayanan ${ }^{1}$ Garvit Kulshreshtha ${ }^{1}$ Vartika Singh ${ }^{1}$ Jared Casper ${ }^{1}$<br>Jan Kautz ${ }^{1}$ Mohammad Shoeybi ${ }^{1}$ Bryan Catanzaro ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ NVIDIA $\\quad{ }^{2}$ University of Wisconsin-Madison ${ }^{3}$ Princeton University<br>${ }^{4}$ Together AI $\\quad{ }^{5}$ Carnegie Mellon University ${ }^{6}$ Cartesia AI\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSelective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Resurrecting Recurrent Neural Networks for Long Sequences  (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Antonio Orvieto, Samuel L.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 62/71 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nu1 = np.random.uniform(size = (N,))\n    u2 = np.random.uniform(size = (N,))\n    nu_log = np.log(-0.5*np.log(u1*(r_max**2-r_min***2) + r_min**2))\n    theta_log = np.log(max_phase*u2)\n    # Glorot initialized Input/Output projection matrices\n    B_re = np.random.normal(size=(N,H))/np.sqrt(2*H)\n    B_im = np.random.normal(size=(N,H))/np.sqrt(2*H)\n    C_re = np.random.normal(size=(H,N))/np.sqrt(N)\n    C_im = np.random.normal(size=(H,N))/np.sqrt(N)\n    D = np.random.normal(size = (H,))\n    # Normalization factor\n    diag_lambda = np.exp(-np.exp(nu_log) + 1j*np.exp(theta_log))\n    gamma_log = np.log(np.sqrt(1-np.abs(diag_lambda)**2))\n    return nu_log, theta_log, B_re, B_im, C_re, C_im, D, gamma_log\ndef binary_operator_diag(element_i, element_j):\n    # Binary operator for parallel scan of linear recurrence. a_i, bu_i = element_i\n    a_j, bu_j = element_j\n    return a_j * a_i, a_j * bu_i + bu_j\n```\n\n\n## B. Related works\n\nWe first discuss standard RNN-based approaches for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and then provide a historical overview on the progress of the literature stemming from the S4 paper (Gu et al., 2021a). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Before the rise of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs were widely used in various applications of natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010), machine translation (Cho et al., 2014b) and text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016). The modern RNN structure (see Eq.1) is mainly attributed to the works of Rumelhart et al. (1985). However, it is possible to see the Hopfield Networks as a particular form of RNN (Hopfield, 1982). Modern RNN formulations are also often related to the Elman Networks (Elman, 1990). The issue of vanishing or exploding gradients, as described by Bengio et al. (1994); Pascanu et al. (2013), is one barrier to training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gradient descent. This problem limits the ability of RNNs to learn, especially on tasks with long input sequences. One of the critical contributions to the success of RNNs was the introduction of gating mechanisms such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) proposed by the Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). LSTMs address the vanishing gradients problem by introducing input, output, and forget gates, which enable the network to selectively remember or forget information from previous time steps. Another popular variant of gated RNNs is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014b) which simplifies the LSTM architecture by merging input and forget gates into a single update gate. Mitigating the vanishing gradient problem with orthogonal and unitary RNNs. Recently, Arjovsky et al. (2016) introduced unitary evolution RNNs (uRNN), where eigenvalues in the RNN transition matrix (see Eq. (1)) are restricted to live on the unit circle. The induced map driving the hidden state evolution, therefore, mixes state components taking into account new inputs - but the signal from past timestamps is not exponentially vanishing/exploding as in the vanilla RNN case (see discussion on stability in \u00a73.2.1). This idea is powerful but introduces two problems: (1) choosing unitary transitions restricts the function approximation class, and (2) training unitary matrices is expensive since a projection on the Stiefel manifold is required at each gradient step. To resolve the second issue, many works devoted attention to carefully designed reparameterization of the transition matrix as e.g., with the product of simpler matrices (Arjovsky et al., 2016), Givens rotations (Jing et al., 2017), Householder reflections (Mhammedi et al., 2017), or as exponentials of skew-symmetric matrices (Hyland and R\u00e4tsch, 2017; Lezcano-Casado and Mart\u0131nez-Rubio, 2019). The approximation capacity of these models is discussed and improved in (Wisdom et al., 2016). A further step in designing efficient orthogonal RNNs is provided by Helfrich et al. (2018), who parametrized skew-symmetric matrix using the Cayley transforms, resulting in a fully real parameter space. Other works which proposed conceptually different solutions to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem include combinations with rectified linear units (Le et al., 2015), Lipschitz RNNs (Erichson et al., 2021), and approaches based on dilated convolutions to increase context size (Bai et al., 2018; Oord et al., 2016)\n\nDeep state-space models (SSMs), a historical overview. Inspired by interesting approaches involving continuous-time representation for recurrent neural networks (Voelker et al., 2019), Gu et al. (2020) recently provided an alternative view on the vanishing gradient problem: one can design linear continuous-time statespace models (SSMs), of the form $\\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t)$ where the state $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is guaranteed to compress all relevant (under a certain metric) information about previously observed (one-dimensional) inputs $u([0, t])$. For instance, by using specific pair of matrices $\\left(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}\\right)$, one can discretize the continuous-time SSM above using a stable, accurate integrator (e.g., bilinear or zero-order-hold) and retrieve the hidden state $x(t)$, which contains the coefficients for the best $N$-th degree polynomial approximation to $u([0, t])$. The idea of Gu et al. (2020) was to then use the resulting discretized structured (i.e., using structured HiPPO matrices) state-space model as a starting for the design and initialization of a novel gated RNN. Later, Gu et al. (2021a) scaled up this idea into a deep architecture, where a collection (one for each input dimension) of discretized continuous-time structured SSM was placed at each layer as a substitute ${ }^{14}$ for the attention block, in an attempt to mitigate the $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ issue in transformers and provide a theoretically principled component for sequence-to-sequence modeling. The model reached state-of-the-art on the Long Range Arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), effectively showcasing the power of discretized linear recurrences using structured\n\n[^9]transition matrices. Notably, the resulting model, named S4, uses a convenient and stable representation of the HiPPO transition, which is initialized using a normal + low-rank matrix and then learned efficiently in diagonal + low-rank form using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and Cauchy kernels. In the months following the publication of S4, Gupta et al. (2022a) noticed that most of S4 performance can be retrieved by only considering the diagonal component of the HiPPO matrix, and therefore showed the power of discretized diagonal structured continuous-time state space models. This architecture is known as DSS. As the interest of the community was rising, with first applications of DSS and S4 in language (Mehta et al., 2022), vision (Nguyen et al., 2022) and audio (Goel et al., 2022), Gu et al. (2022a) further simplified DSS providing a diagonal form (S4D) with theoretical guarantees in the infinite width setting. Notably Gu et al. (2022a) showed that, to retrieve most performance of S4, one can simply initialize the transition matrix $A$ in diagonal form, with entries $a_{n}=-\\frac{1}{2}+i \\pi n$ (S4D-Lin) or $a_{n}=-\\frac{1}{2}+i \\frac{N}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{N}{n+1}-1\\right)$ (S4D-Inv). Our interest in S4-like models spiked at this point since the findings of Gu et al. (2022a) suggest that, given the effectiveness of such simplified versions of $A$, the root of $S 4$ success might be attributable to more fundamental effects are orthogonal to the HiPPO theory. Shortly after, Smith et al. (2022) found that one can also depart from the formal one-dimensional discretization structure of S4, rooted in the HiPPO theory, and considered a simplified version where all input dimensions are efficiently and simultaneously processed using parallel scans (Martin and Cundy, 2017) \u2014 not separately like in S4, S4D, and DSS. This model (named S5) set a new state-of-the art on PathX, the hardest task in the Long Range Arena, and provides further evidence for a conceptually simpler motivation for the performance of deep state-space models. Indeed, as already mentioned, 55 is not precisely the discretization of a latent continuoustime SSM, yet still includes parameters like discretization stepsizes that have an ambiguous interpretation in this context ${ }^{15}$, suggesting further investigations are needed. At the same time, a few interesting works developed novel variants of the S4 architecture. Liquid S4 used the original (non-diagonal) S4 formulation combined with liquid time-constant networks (Hasani et al., 2021, 2022). Similar to DSS, S4D, and S5, Mega also simplified S4 to a diagonal SSM (Ma et al., 2022) while showing additionally that restricting the diagonal $A$ to real numbers - giving it an exponential moving average (EMA) interpretation - can still work well when combined with attention and a gated block design. Another intriguing view was provided by the SGConv model (Li et al., 2022a), which leverages the convolutional interpretation of SSMs (Gu et al., 2021b) to design a purely filter-based version of S4, with no latent continuous-time model or need for discretization. The discretization viewpoint also attracted the interest of Gupta et al. (2022b), concurrent to this work, who pointed out that, after numerical integration, diagonal state-space models and linear RNNs share the same function approximation class. Gupta et al. (2022b) then introduced DLR, most closely related to DSS and S4D (each input is processed independently at each layer) but where the discretization stepsize $\\Delta$ is absorbed into the continuous-time transition matrix A (see \u00a72). Their focus was on a new set of synthetic long-range tasks with strong supervision (e.g. segmentation), while ours is on the established Long Range Arena benchmark. To conclude, we point the reader to interesting recent applications of models inspired by the S4 architecture. In addition to earlier applications in NLP (Mehta et al., 2022), more sophisticated architectures based on S4 recently showed great promise in language modeling (Dao et al., 2022b; Ma et al., 2022). Specifically, Dao et al. (2022b) designed a new generative language model, H3, that outperforms GPT-Neo-2.7B with SSMs, augmented with two attention layers. Besides language, deep state-space models were also found successful for long video/audio understanding and generation tasks (Goel et al., 2022; Islam and Bertasius, 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022), and have attracted interest in biology (Bordin et al., 2022) and time series forecasting (Zhou et al., 2022).\n```\n\n#### 5.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 4 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Liquid S4 language model implementation code\", \"Numerical stability input-dependent state transitions in SSMs\", \"Liquid S4 implementation language modeling code\", \"Numerical stability techniques in input-dependent SSMs\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator\n\n*From Search Query: \"Liquid S4 language model implementation code\"*\n\n*Chengshu Li, Jacky Liang, Andy Zeng, Xinyun Chen, Karol Hausman, Dorsa Sadigh, Sergey Levine, Fei-Fei Li, Fei Xia, Brian Ichter*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning and broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by\"thinking in code\".\n\n**Abstract:** Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter - we hypothesize that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for\"detect_sarcasm(string)\"that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but also selectively\"emulate\"the interpreter by generating the expected output of\"detect_sarcasm(string)\". In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an\"LMulator\"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by\"thinking in code\".\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 44  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets\n\n*From Search Query: \"Liquid S4 language model implementation code\"*\n\n*Seonghyeon Ye, Doyoung Kim, Sungdong Kim, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungone Kim, Yongrae Jo, James Thorne, Juho Kim, Minjoon Seo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation which decomposes coarse- level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction and observes that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation.\n\n**Abstract:** Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because instruction-following necessitates alignment with human values and the required set of skills varies depending on the instruction. However, previous studies have mainly focused on coarse-grained evaluation (i.e. overall preference-based evaluation), which limits interpretability since it does not consider the nature of user instructions that require instance-wise skill composition. In this paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation which decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction. We experimentally observe that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation. Using FLASK, we compare multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe a high correlation between model-based and human-based evaluations.

While most of the work has focused on cooperation and collaboration between agents, little work explores competition, another important mechanism that promotes the development of society and economy. In this paper, we seek to examine the competition dynamics in LLM-based agents. We first propose a general framework for studying the competition between agents. Then, we implement a practical competitive environment using GPT-4 to simulate a virtual town with two types of agents, restaurant agents and customer agents. Specifically, the restaurant agents compete with each other to attract more customers, where competition encourages them to transform, such as cultivating new operating strategies. Simulation experiments reveal several interesting findings at the micro and macro levels, which align well with existing market and sociological theories. We hope that the framework and environment can be a promising testbed to study competition that fosters understanding of society.

However, they inherently lack 2D graph perception - a critical ability of human professionals in comprehending molecules' topological structures. To bridge this gap, we propose MolCA: Molecular Graph-Language Modeling with Cross-Modal Projector and Uni-Modal Adapter. MolCA enables an LM (e.g., Galactica) to understand both text- and graph-based molecular contents via the cross-modal projector. Specifically, the cross-modal projector is implemented as a Q-Former to connect a graph encoder's representation space and an LM's text space. Further, MolCA employs a uni-modal adapter (i.e., LoRA) for the LM's efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. Unlike previous studies that couple an LM with a graph encoder via cross-modal contrastive learning, MolCA retains the LM's ability of open-ended text generation and augments it with 2D graph information. To showcase its effectiveness, we extensively benchmark MolCA on tasks of molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction, and molecule-text retrieval, on which MolCA significantly outperforms the baselines.

Diagonal State Spaces are as Effective as Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Liquid S4 language model implementation code\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Albert Gu, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long range dependencies in sequential data is a fundamental step\ntowards attaining human-level performance in many modalities such as text,\nvision, audio and video.

Accelerating Toeplitz Neural Network with Constant-time Inference\n  Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical stability input-dependent state transitions in SSMs\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) have exhibited outstanding performance in\nvarious sequence modeling tasks. They outperform commonly used\nTransformer-based models while benefiting from log-linear space-time\ncomplexities. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) achieve lower\nperformance than TNNs in language modeling but offer the advantage of constant\ninference complexity. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs\nand SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to\nachieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this,\nwe formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a\nclosed-form solution. We demonstrate how to transform the target equation into\na Vandermonde linear system problem, which can be efficiently solved using the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Notably, our method requires no training and\nmaintains numerical stability. It can be also applied to any LongConv-based\nmodel.

Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical stability input-dependent state transitions in SSMs\"*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs\nlike the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities\nintroduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications. In this\npaper, we propose an advanced architecture that mitigates these challenges by\ndecomposing A-multiplications into multiple groups and optimizing positional\nencoding through Grouped Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. This new\nstructure, denoted as Grouped FIR-enhanced SSM (GFSSM), employs semiseparable\nmatrices for efficient computation. Furthermore, inspired by the \"attention\nsink\" phenomenon identified in streaming language models, we incorporate a\nsimilar mechanism to enhance the stability and performance of our model over\nextended sequences. Our approach further bridges the gap between SSMs and\nTransformer architectures, offering a viable path forward for scalable and\nhigh-performing sequence modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-01T02:49:58Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-01T02:49:58Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating Liquid Structural State-Space Models (Liquid S4) into language models with a focus on numerical stability, efficiency, and performance analysis, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Numerical Stability in Input-Dependent State Transitions\n\n- **Eigenvalue Stability**: Ensuring the eigenvalues of the state transition matrices \\( A_t \\) are within a stable range is crucial. This can be achieved through parameterizations that keep these eigenvalues inside the unit circle for discrete-time systems. References such as Gu et al. (2021) discuss methods for maintaining this stability.\n\n- **Initialization Strategies**: Proper initialization of weights, such as initializing \\( A_t \\) close to identity matrices or using orthogonal initialization, can prevent issues like exploding or vanishing gradients. This is highlighted in the analysis note and supported by studies like Le and Gupta (2023).\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Applying spectral normalization or weight decay can prevent weights from growing too large, and gradient clipping can maintain stability during training. These techniques are discussed in the context of training instability in SSMs and Transformers.\n\n## Efficient Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Utilizing FFTs**: Implementing convolution operations using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) can efficiently handle long sequences. This is a key aspect of the Liquid S4 implementation, as mentioned in the analysis note and supported by the implementation details in Hasani et al. (2022).\n\n- **Code-Level Optimizations**: Avoiding Python-level loops and using efficient tensor operations provided by libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow can leverage hardware acceleration. The `S4` class in the Liquid S4 implementation provides methods for efficient computation using FFTs and normalization layers to ensure numerical stability.\n\n## Practical Code Examples and Techniques\n\n- **Code Repositories**: Searching for publicly available repositories that implement Liquid S4 in language models can provide practical insights. For example, the hypothetical \"LiquidS4-LanguageModel\" GitHub repository mentioned in the analysis note would be highly relevant.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The `liquids4_edu.py` code associated with Hasani et al.'s paper provides a detailed implementation of Liquid S4, including methods for parameter initialization, state updates, and efficient computation using FFTs. This code can serve as a practical example for integrating Liquid S4 into language models.\n\n## Empirical Performance Data\n\n- **Benchmarking Studies**: Empirical evaluation is crucial to assess the performance gains from integrating Liquid S4. Studies that compare metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and computational efficiency with standard baselines are essential. For instance, comparing the performance of Liquid S4-integrated models with models like Mamba, as mentioned in the context of high information density synthetic tasks, can provide valuable insights.\n\n## Alternative Architectures\n\n- **Mamba Architecture**: Examining the Mamba architecture and its performance on synthetic tasks can offer additional benefits. Mamba's ability to achieve significant performance gains on high information density tasks by incorporating global selection mechanisms could be a valuable alternative or complementary approach to Liquid S4.\n\n### Useful References and Excerpts\n\n- **Hasani, R.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Key Goals and Considerations\n- **Numerical Stability**: Ensuring the stability of the model, particularly in input-dependent state-space models (SSMs).\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Optimizing the model for efficient handling of long sequences and reducing computational overhead.\n- **Performance**: Improving performance on language modeling tasks, including long-range dependency modeling and in-context learning.\n- **Hybrid Models**: Exploring the integration of SSMs with other architectures, such as attention mechanisms.\n\n## Useful Information\n\n### Numerical Stability Techniques\n- **Eigenvalue Stability**: Ensuring the eigenvalues of the state transition matrices are within a stable range. This can be achieved through constrained parameterizations and spectral normalization.\n- **Initialization Strategies**: Proper initialization, such as using identity matrices or orthogonal initialization, to prevent exploding or vanishing gradients.\n- **Regularization Techniques**: Using spectral normalization, weight decay, and gradient clipping to maintain numerical stability during training.\n\n### Efficient Implementation Considerations\n- **Utilizing FFTs**: Implementing convolution operations using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to efficiently handle long sequences. This is particularly relevant for models like Liquid S4.\n- **Code-Level Optimizations**: Avoiding Python-level loops and leveraging efficient tensor operations and hardware acceleration provided by libraries like PyTorch.\n\n### Practical Code Examples and Architectures\n- **Liquid S4 and Variants**: The `liquids4_edu.py` code provides a detailed implementation of Liquid S4. However, variants like Gated State Spaces (GSS) and Diagonal State Spaces (DSS) offer simpler and more stable alternatives.\n- **Mamba Architecture**: Hybrid models like Mamba-2-Hybrid, which combine SSMs with attention mechanisms, have shown superior performance on various tasks. This could be a viable approach to integrate into FastTTTLinear.\n\n### Empirical Performance Data\n- **Benchmarking**: Studies comparing Liquid S4-integrated models to standard baselines are crucial.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.78)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content. (Right Bottom) The Induction Heads task is an example of associative recall that requires retrieving an answer based on context, a key ability for LLMs. ```\nAlgorithm 1 SSM (S4)\nAlgorithm 2 SSM + Selection (S6)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\n    1: \\(A:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    1: \\(\\boldsymbol{A}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n\\(\\triangleright\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n                            \\(>\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n        B \\(:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    2: \\(\\boldsymbol{B}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow s_{B}(x)\\)\n        \\(C:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n        \\(\\Delta:(\\mathrm{D}) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\) (Parameter)\n        \\(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, A, B)\\)\n        \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n            \\(\\Delta\\) Time-invariant: recurrence or convolution\n    return \\(y\\)\n    3: \\(C:(B, L, N) \\leftarrow s_{C}(x)\\)\n    4: \\(\\Delta:(B, L, D) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\left(\\right.\\) Parameter \\(\\left.+s_{\\Delta}(x)\\right)\\)\n    5: \\(\\bar{A}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})\\)\n    6: \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n        \\(\\Delta\\) Time-varying: recurrence (scan) only\n    7: return \\(y\\)\n```\n\n\n### 3.3 Efficient Implementation of Selective SSMs\n\nHardware-friendly primitives such as convolutions (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) enjoy widespread application. Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The superior performance of Transformers is attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to aggregate the information from the input sequence. In contrast to its success, self-attention mechanism has a potential problem that it requires a large amount of computation and memory. To deal with this issue, many studies have been attempted to develop efficient models that can replace Transformers. Among them, Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered considerable interest recently. One advantage of SSMs is that the output can be computed with a significantly small time using convolution via FFT algorithm or recursive computation. Based on the original SSMs, many improvements have been proposed, such as HiPPO-based intialization (Gu et al. 2021) and architectures using gated convolutions (Fu et al. 2022, Poli et al., 2023). Networks based on SSMs have accomplished high performance in various applications such as gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2024), audio generation (Goel et al., 2022) and speech recognition (Saon et al. 2023). On the other hand, some of the recent studies pointed out the limitations of SSMs, especially for their abilities to solve tasks. For example, Merrill et al. (2024) show that SSMs cannot solve sequential problems from the view of computational complexity theory. Additionally, Gu and Dao (2023) pointed out that SSMs are less effective for the tasks to handle discrete and information-dense data such as language processing. Therefore, it is still unclear in what situation we can replace Transformers with SSMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5e098f2beaae0c90c478g-02.jpg?height=258&width=1373&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1.1: Conceptual illustrations of the abilities of SSMs. Left: This represents the classification task in which the existence of the token \" $A$ \" or \" $B$ \" is important. We prove that SSMs can extract such tokens, even if the position of the important token is different for each input. Right: This illustrate the task to predict the next token in the sequence. In this task, models have to output the token associated with the last token. We also prove that SSMs can solve such tasks, i.e., SSMs can extract appropriate tokens even if the position of essential tokens are different for each token in the same sequence. Recently, some studies have theoretically investigated the abilities of SSMs. For instance, Wang and Xue (2024) show that SSMs are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Additionally, Massaroli et al. (2024) constructed the parameters of SSMs to solve the task called associated recall. Moreover, Cirone et al. (2024) studied the abilities of SSMs using rough path theory. However, they mainly focus on the expressive power of SSMs and do not provide statistical understanding. Furthermore, quantitative evaluations to compare SSMs and Transformers is limited. Leaving aside SSMs, many studies have investigated the abilities of deep neural networks to estimate functions. Some of them analyze the estimation abilities of fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with the assumption that the target function is in certain function classes (Schmidt-Hieber, 2020, Suzuki, 2018) or have a specific smoothness structure (Suzuki and Nitanda, 2021). Moreover, Nakada and Imaizumi (2020) and Chen et al. (2022) consider the setting that the data distribution has a low-dimensional structure. Additionally, Okumoto and Suzuki (2021) studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and showed that CNNs can estimate the functions that have smoothness structures with the minimax optimal rate even if the input is infinite-dimensional. As for the Transformers, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate the functions with infinitedimensional input as well as CNNs. Additionally, they showed that Transformers can estimate the functions whose smoothness structure changes depending on the input. Our contributions. In this paper, we explore the abilities of SSMs with gated convolution to replace Transformers from the perspective of statistical learning theory. More specifically, we investigate the estimation ability of SSMs for the function classes called $\\gamma$-smooth and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth. For the function in these classes, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate them effectively. We prove that SSMs can also estimate those functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers, and show that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating those functions. The essential point of the two function classes above is that they have smoothness structures. As for $\\gamma$-smooth functions, the smoothness of the function is the same for all input sequences, i.e., the important features to extract are fixed. On the other hand, piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions have different smoothness depending on the input. This function class characterizes the ability of Transformers and SSMs to extract important features dynamically. In addition to the settings considered in Takakura and Suzuki (2023), we also consider the functions whose smoothness structure also changes depending on the position output token. This setting is inspired by the ability of Transformers to solve the task called associative recall (Ba et al. 2016). We show that SSMs can also replace Transformers in this setting. See Figure 1.1 for the conceptual illustrations of those function classes. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We theoretically investigate the estimation ability of SSMs with gated convolutions for $\\gamma$ smooth functions and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions. We show that SSMs can achieve the same estimation error as Transformers, which implies that SSMs may be alternative to Transformers in terms of estimating functions in those classes. 2. Inspired by recent research on the abilities of Transformers, we define function classes that are extensions of the piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth function class. Then, we prove that SSMs can also attain the similar estimation error for those classes. Other related works. The function classes with piecewise smoothness are also considered in Petersen and Voigtlaender (2018) and Imaizumi and Fukumizu (2019). They do not consider anisotropic smoothness or the sequence-to-sequence functions, while we consider such situations. One of the other directions to investigate the abilities of SSMs is to utilize the control theory, like Alonso et al. (2024). Instead of focusing on the statistical aspect, they mainly provide a comprehensive understanding of existing SSMs. Gu and DaO (2023) proposed an SSM-based architecture called Mamba, whose filter is controlled by the input. While convolution with FFT algorithms cannot be used for Mamba, they proposed a hardware-aware efficient implementation. In this paper, we do not focus on the setting that filters are controlled by the input, and we consider SSMs with gated convolution with data-independent filters.\n```\n\n#### 4. State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview (Avg. Score: 0.62)\n\n*Carmen Amo Alonso, Jerome Sieber, M. Zeilinger*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective is provided, and a comparative analysis of these models is presented, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear state-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation models. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"gated ssm initialization\", \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\", \"hardware efficient ssm\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated ssm initialization\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 215  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated ssm initialization\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** A state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 334  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 4. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5.

However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \\ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-$\\pi$-1B Pro and PanGu-$\\pi$-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-$\\pi$-1B Pro. Besides, PanGu-$\\pi$-1.5B Pro surpasses a range of SOTA models with larger model sizes, validating its superior performance.

Memory Optimization for Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Aashaka Shah, Chaoxia Wu, Jayashree Mohan, Vijay Chidambaram, Philipp Krahenbuhl*\n\n**TL;DR:** MONeT is an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks, and is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning is slowly, but steadily, hitting a memory bottleneck. While the tensor computation in top-of-the-line GPUs increased by 32x over the last five years, the total available memory only grew by 2.5x. This prevents researchers from exploring larger architectures, as training large networks requires more memory for storing intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present MONeT, an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks. MONeT jointly optimizes the checkpointing schedule and the implementation of various operators. MONeT is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing. MONeT reduces the overall memory requirement by 3x for various PyTorch models, with a 9-16% overhead in computation. For the same computation cost, MONeT requires 1.2-1.8x less memory than current state-of-the-art automated checkpointing frameworks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 8. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated ssm initialization\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Pretraining Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated ssm initialization\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Jing Nathan Yan, Albert Gu, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. While other\narchitectures have been used, downstream accuracy is either significantly\nworse, or requires attention layers to match standard benchmarks such as GLUE.\nThis work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in\nsequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs). Our proposed model,\nBidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM layers with a multiplicative\ngating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling\narchitectures. The model learns static layers that do not consider pair-wise\ninteractions. Even so, BiGS is able to match BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE\nand can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without\napproximation. Analysis shows that while the models have similar average\naccuracy, the approach has different inductive biases than BERT in terms of\ninteractions and syntactic representations. All models from this work are\navailable at https://github.com/jxiw/BiGS.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-20T18:50:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-09T01:08:20Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/renll/SeqBoat.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-19T23:10:02Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-04T21:26:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning to Summarize Long Texts with Memory Compression and Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Jaehong Park, Jonathan Pilault, Christopher Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mem2Mem, a memory-to-memory mechanism for hierarchical recurrent\nneural network based encoder decoder architectures and we explore its use for\nabstractive document summarization. Mem2Mem transfers \"memories\" via\nreadable/writable external memory modules that augment both the encoder and\ndecoder. Our memory regularization compresses an encoded input article into a\nmore compact set of sentence representations. Most importantly, the memory\ncompression step performs implicit extraction without labels, sidestepping\nissues with suboptimal ground-truth data and exposure bias of hybrid\nextractive-abstractive summarization techniques. By allowing the decoder to\nread/write over the encoded input memory, the model learns to read salient\ninformation about the input article while keeping track of what has been\ngenerated. Our Mem2Mem approach yields results that are competitive with state\nof the art transformer based summarization methods, but with 16 times fewer\nparameters\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Kevin Galim, Wonjun Kang, Yuchen Zeng, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024), have emerged\nas powerful tools for language modeling, offering high performance with\nefficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length. However, the\napplication of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to SSM-based\nmodels remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to systematically study two\nkey questions: (i) How do existing PEFT methods perform on SSM-based models?\n(ii) Which modules are most effective for fine-tuning? We conduct an empirical\nbenchmark of four basic PEFT methods on SSM-based models. Our findings reveal\nthat prompt-based methods (e.g., prefix-tuning) are no longer effective, an\nempirical result further supported by theoretical analysis. In contrast, LoRA\nremains effective for SSM-based models. We further investigate the optimal\napplication of LoRA within these models, demonstrating both theoretically and\nexperimentally that applying LoRA to linear projection matrices without\nmodifying SSM modules yields the best results, as LoRA is not effective at\ntuning SSM modules. To further improve performance, we introduce LoRA with\nSelective Dimension tuning (SDLoRA), which selectively updates certain channels\nand states on SSM modules while applying LoRA to linear projection matrices.\nExtensive experimental results show that this approach outperforms standard\nLoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-11T17:30:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-11T17:30:28Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. A Hybrid Tensor-Expert-Data Parallelism Approach to Optimize Mixture-of-Experts Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Abhinav Bhatele, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Olatunji Ruwase, Siddharth Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that adds sparsely activated expert blocks to a base model, increasing the number of parameters without impacting computational costs. However, current distributed deep learning frameworks are limited in their ability to train high-quality MoE models with large base models. In this work, we present DeepSpeed-TED, a novel, three-dimensional, hybrid parallel algorithm that combines data, tensor, and expert parallelism to enable the training of MoE models with 4 to 8x larger base models than the current state-of-the-art. We also describe memory optimizations in the optimizer step, and communication optimizations that eliminate unnecessary data movement. We implement our approach in DeepSpeed and achieve speedups of 26% over a baseline (i.e. without our communication optimizations) when training a 40 billion parameter MoE model (6.7 billion base model with 16 experts) on 128 V100 GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. HelixFold: An Efficient Implementation of AlphaFold2 using PaddlePaddle\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture memory optimization\"*\n\n*Yanjun Ma, Fan Wang, dianhai yu, Yingfei Xiang, Yang Xue, Yiqun Liu, Zhihua Wu, Xiaomin Fang, Guoxia Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate protein structure prediction can significantly accelerate the development of life science. The accuracy of AlphaFold2, a frontier end-to-end structure prediction system, is already close to that of the experimental determination techniques. Due to the complex model architecture and large memory consumption, it requires lots of computational resources and time to implement the training and inference of AlphaFold2 from scratch. The cost of running the original AlphaFold2 is expensive for most individuals and institutions. Therefore, reducing this cost could accelerate the development of life science. We implement AlphaFold2 using PaddlePaddle, namely HelixFold, to improve training and inference speed and reduce memory consumption. The performance is improved by operator fusion, tensor fusion, and hybrid parallelism computation, while the memory is optimized through Recompute, BFloat16, and memory read/write in-place. Compared with the original AlphaFold2 (implemented with Jax) and OpenFold (implemented with PyTorch), HelixFold needs only 7.5 days to complete the full end-to-end training and only 5.3 days when using hybrid parallelism, while both AlphaFold2 and OpenFold take about 11 days. HelixFold saves 1x training time. We verified that HelixFold's accuracy could be on par with AlphaFold2 on the CASP14 and CAMEO datasets. HelixFold's code is available on GitHub for free download: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/protein_folding/helixfold, and we also provide stable web services on https://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/drug/protein/forecast.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals and the detailed analysis provided, here are some key findings and references that align with the requirements for improving autoregressive language model design using gated State Space Models (SSMs), hybrid architectures, and hardware-efficient implementations.\n\n## Initialization and Stability Techniques for Gated SSMs\n\n### Parameter Initialization Methods\n- The paper on \"Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners\" discusses the importance of stable recurrent forms and gating mechanisms.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/28 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nwhere decoding every token requires attending to the whole past. The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. To facilitate modeling discrete data, the model in Eq. 2 can be discretized (using the bilinear method) by a step size $\\Delta$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1}(\\mathbf{I}+\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\\\\n& \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\Delta \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe unroll the above recurrent representation, after which we have\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\cdots+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as a convolutional representation $y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u$, where the convolution kernel\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\cdots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" is the discrete convolution operator, $u$ represents the input sequence $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, and $y$ represents the corresponding output sequence $\\left(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{L}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 4. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Finite-Time Convergence in Continuous-Time Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"numerical stability state space\"*\n\n*O. Romero, M.

Equipped with this condition, we synthesize first and second-order (in an optimization variable) dynamical systems that achieve finite-time convergence to the minima of a given sufficiently regular cost function. As a byproduct, we show that the q-rescaled gradient flow (q-RGF) proposed by Wibisono et al. (2016) is indeed finite-time convergent, provided the cost function is gradient dominated of order p \u2208 (1, q). This way, we effectively bridge a gap between the q-RGF and the finite-time convergent normalized gradient flow (NGF) (q =\u221e) proposed by Cort\u00e9s (2006) in his seminal paper in the context of multiagent systems.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Stable Architectures for Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"numerical stability state space\"*\n\n*Eldad Haber, Lars Ruthotto*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine\nlearning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior\nresults over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated\npatterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and\ntrain such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep\narchitectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning\nalgorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we\npropose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to\nwell-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks.\n  The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a\nparameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this\nformulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use\nthis new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the\nexploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete\nODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep\nnetworks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several\nnumerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art\nnetworks.\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linear Attention Mechanism: An Efficient Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Jianlin Su, Rui Li, Shunyi Zheng, Chenxi Duan*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, to remedy this deficiency, we propose a Linear Attention Mechanism which is approximate to dot-product attention with much less memory and computational costs. The efficient design makes the incorporation between attention mechanisms and neural networks more flexible and versatile. Experiments conducted on semantic segmentation demonstrated the effectiveness of linear attention mechanism.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using gated state space models, here are some key points and references that address the specified details:\n\n## Implementation Details of Gated State Space Models\n\n### Initialization Strategies and Stability Considerations\n- The paper on Longhorn state space models discusses the importance of initialization and stability in state space models. It highlights that the design of \\(A_t, B_t\\) functions in the state space recurrence is crucial and often involves imposing low-dimensional structures to avoid prohibitively large weight matrices. The paper also introduces an online learning perspective to streamline the design of these models, which can help in maintaining stability.\n- The initialization of the memory state \\(S_0\\) and the choice of the multiplication operation (e.g., Hadamard product or matrix product) are critical. The Longhorn model, for example, uses a specific linear recurrence and a gated linear unit (GLU) to ensure stable updates of the memory state.\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Hardware Optimization\n- The Mamba model, which integrates a state space model (SSM) with gated CNN blocks, provides insights into memory efficiency. The Mamba block extends the Gated CNN with an SSM, and the architecture is designed to be efficient in terms of parameters and FLOPs. For instance, MambaOut models achieve high accuracy on ImageNet with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs compared to other models.\n- The Longhorn model demonstrates the ability to extrapolate to long context lengths (up to 32K) without significant perplexity drop, indicating efficient memory usage during inference.\n\n## Comparisons Between Different Attention Mechanisms and State Space Models\n\n### Performance Characteristics and Computational Complexity\n- The Longhorn paper compares state space models with other sequence mixing mechanisms like linear attention variants (e.g., Linear Attention, Retention Network, Gated Linear Attention). It shows that state space models can capture long-range dependencies effectively and maintain linear computational complexity, similar to linear attention mechanisms but with the added benefit of recurrent processing.\n- The Mamba model's performance on ImageNet, where it outperforms other models with fewer parameters and FLOPs, suggests that integrating SSMs can be computationally efficient and effective.\n\n### Memory Requirements and Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n- State space models like Longhorn and Mamba are designed to handle long-range dependencies through their recurrent nature. The Longhorn model, in particular, can extrapolate to very long context lengths, which is a significant advantage over traditional attention mechanisms that may suffer from quadratic complexity in sequence length.\n- The comparison between Mamba's SSM and other attention mechanisms in terms of memory requirements indicates that SSMs can be more memory-efficient, especially when handling long sequences.\n\n## Integration of Gating Mechanisms in Language Models\n\n### Impact on Model Expressiveness and Training Stability\n- The integration of gating mechanisms in state space models, as seen in the Longhorn and Mamba models, enhances model expressiveness by allowing input-dependent processing. This can improve the handling of long-range dependencies and adaptability during inference.\n- The use of gated linear units (GLUs) in these models helps in maintaining training stability by controlling the flow of information through the network.\n\n### Computational Overhead and Memory Requirements\n- The computational overhead of integrating gating mechanisms in state space models is generally manageable. The Longhorn model, for example, maintains linear computational complexity, and the Mamba model reduces overall computational costs compared to other architectures.\n- The memory requirements are also efficiently managed, as these models are designed to handle long sequences without significant increases in memory usage.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Numerical Stability Techniques\n- Ensuring numerical stability in deep state space models involves careful initialization strategies and gradient management. The Longhorn paper suggests using an online learning perspective to streamline the design and ensure stability.\n- Effective approaches to gradient management include using techniques like gradient clipping and normalization, which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources but are common practices in deep learning.\n\n### Hardware Optimization\n- Optimizing the implementation for modern hardware involves leveraging parallel processing and efficient memory access. The MambaOut implementation provides scripts for distributed training and optimization on multiple GPUs, which can be a model for optimizing other state space models.\n\nIn summary, the Longhorn and Mamba models provide valuable insights into the implementation, stability, and efficiency of gated state space models. These models demonstrate how integrating state space models with gating mechanisms can improve the expressiveness, stability, and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n",

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

Score: 0.03)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/30 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

We note that biological agents have no option but to operate inductively, due to (a) hard memory bounds, and (b) evolutionary pressure towards minimizing inference latency: When faced with a threat, a biological agent is better served by a quick suboptimal decision than by reasoning over all past experience. AI built on silicon has no such limitations: Memory can grow unbounded and test-time computation can be distributed and improved by hardware design. Nonetheless, any practical realization involves some kind of constraint on inference time or compute resources. Therefore, resource-constrained optimal inference hinges on how to best use the available resources against a growing memory. Example A. 2 (CNN Classifiers, VAEs and GANs). A trained representation can be co-opted to generate data. For example, a CNN can be used to classify random data until one is labeled with the desired class, and the resulting sample considered as being \"generated\" by the CNN. Similarly, one could generate random data indirectly by feeding noise to an encoder, as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), again co-opting a representation for generating data. In a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), data is generated by perturbing the latent representation of a map trained to re-construct the dataset. Example A. 3 (Diffusion Models). Diffusion Models are representations, trained to re-construct the original data, but the mechanics used to reconstruct the data during training are sequential, using an artificial \"time\" variable, akin to a realization. This makes their use as \"generative representation\" natural since the reconstruction process is already a stochastic realization $8^{8}$\nExample A.\n```\n\n#### 5.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"state space model initialization\", \"memory optimization techniques\", \"test-time training stability\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** A state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 334  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 2.

Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 240  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 4.

Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity.

Ponomareva, Zhe Zhao, R. Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint, and extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework, CHITA, which leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training stability\"*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 180  (*Influential: 57*)\n\n#### 7. Learning to Confuse: Generating Training Time Adversarial Data with Auto-Encoder\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training stability\"*\n\n*Ji Feng, Qi-Zhi Cai, Zhi-Hua Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** The method proposed in this paper can be easily extended to the label specific setting where the attacker can manipulate the predictions of the victim classifiers according to some predefined rules rather than only making wrong predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we consider one challenging training time attack by modifying training data with bounded perturbation, hoping to manipulate the behavior (both targeted or non-targeted) of any corresponding trained classifier during test time when facing clean samples. To achieve this, we proposed to use an auto-encoder-like network to generate the pertubation on the training data paired with one differentiable system acting as the imaginary victim classifier. The perturbation generator will learn to update its weights by watching the training procedure of the imaginary classifier in order to produce the most harmful and imperceivable noise which in turn will lead the lowest generalization power for the victim classifier. This can be formulated into a non-linear equality constrained optimization problem. Unlike GANs, solving such problem is computationally challenging, we then proposed a simple yet effective procedure to decouple the alternating updates for the two networks for stability. The method proposed in this paper can be easily extended to the label specific setting where the attacker can manipulate the predictions of the victim classifiers according to some predefined rules rather than only making wrong predictions. Experiments on various datasets including CIFAR-10 and a reduced version of ImageNet confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method and empirical results showed that, such bounded perturbation have good transferability regardless of which classifier the victim is actually using on image data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 95  (*Influential: 24*)\n\n#### 8.

This defense ability, however, is challenged in this paper. We identify a novel threat model named stability attack, which aims to hinder robust availability by slightly manipulating the training data. Under this threat, we show that adversarial training using a conventional defense budget $\\epsilon$ provably fails to provide test robustness in a simple statistical setting, where the non-robust features of the training data can be reinforced by $\\epsilon$-bounded perturbation. Further, we analyze the necessity of enlarging the defense budget to counter stability attacks. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that stability attacks are harmful on benchmark datasets, and thus the adaptive defense is necessary to maintain robustness.

Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models\n  Requires Data-Driven Priors\n\n*From Search Query: \"state space model initialization\"*\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in\nmachine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that\ndramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these\nimpressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks\n(e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to\npredict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that\nrandom initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between\narchitectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using\n$\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across\nmultiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state\nspace models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla\nTransformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly\npretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256\ntask by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of\npreviously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become\nmostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through\npretraining.

However most works don't target the largest component\nof allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored\nfor the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used\nin the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous\nmethods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained\nparameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding\nadditional memory overheads.

While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence.

BranchNorm: Robustly Scaling Extremely Deep Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training stability\"*\n\n*Yijin Liu, Xianfeng Zeng, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, DeepNorm scales Transformers into extremely deep (i.e., 1000\nlayers) and reveals the promising potential of deep scaling. To stabilize the\ntraining of deep models, DeepNorm (Wang et al., 2022) attempts to constrain the\nmodel update to a constant value. Although applying such a constraint can\nbenefit the early stage of model training, it may lead to undertrained models\nduring the whole training procedure. In this paper, we propose BranchNorm,\nwhich dynamically rescales the non-residual branch of Transformer in accordance\nwith the training period. BranchNorm not only theoretically stabilizes the\ntraining with smooth gradient norms at the early stage, but also encourages\nbetter convergence in the subsequent training stage. Experiment results on\nmultiple translation tasks demonstrate that BranchNorm achieves a better\ntrade-off between training stability and converge performance.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-04T12:46:12Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-04T12:46:12Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"state space model initialization\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Ankit Gupta, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

PyTorch FSDP: Experiences on Scaling Fully Sharded Data Parallel\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Shen Li, Ajit Mathews, Yuchen Hao, Geeta Chauhan, Pritam Damania, Bernard Nguyen, Can Balioglu, Alban Desmaison, Sam Shleifer, Myle Ott, Hamid Shojanazeri, Less Wright, Min Xu, Chien-chin Huang, Liang Luo, Rohan Varma, Andrew Gu, Yanli Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** It is widely acknowledged that large models have the potential to deliver superior performance across a broad range of domains. Despite the remarkable progress made in the field of machine learning systems research, which has enabled the development and exploration of large models, such abilities remain confined to a small group of advanced users and industry leaders, resulting in an implicit technical barrier for the wider community to access and leverage these technologies. In this paper, we introduce PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as an industry-grade solution for large model training. FSDP has been closely co-designed with several key PyTorch core components including Tensor implementation, dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to provide non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency. Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to optimize resource utilization across a variety of hardware configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSDP is capable of achieving comparable performance to Distributed Data Parallel while providing support for significantly larger models with near-linear scalability in terms of TFLOPS.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Elixir: Train a Large Language Model on a Small GPU Cluster\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Yang You, Shenggui Li, Hongxin Liu, Jiarui Fang, Haichen Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, large language models have achieved great success due to their unprecedented size. However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models. The beta version of Elixir is now available at https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/feature/elixir.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training stability\"*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Progressive Distillation for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training stability\"*\n\n*Jonathan Ho, Tim Salimans*\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently shown great promise for generative modeling, outperforming GANs on perceptual quality and autoregressive models at density estimation. A remaining downside is their slow sampling time: generating high quality samples takes many hundreds or thousands of model evaluations. Here we make two contributions to help eliminate this downside: First, we present new parameterizations of diffusion models that provide increased stability when using few sampling steps. Second, we present a method to distill a trained deterministic diffusion sampler, using many steps, into a new diffusion model that takes half as many sampling steps. We then keep progressively applying this distillation procedure to our model, halving the number of required sampling steps each time. On standard image generation benchmarks like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and LSUN, we start out with state-of-the-art samplers taking as many as 8192 steps, and are able to distill down to models taking as few as 4 steps without losing much perceptual quality; achieving, for example, a FID of 3.0 on CIFAR-10 in 4 steps. Finally, we show that the full progressive distillation procedure does not take more time than it takes to train the original model, thus representing an efficient solution for generative modeling using diffusion at both train and test time.\n\n**Conference:** progressive-distillation-for-fast-sampling-of\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state space models, here are some key insights and techniques derived from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Initialization and Stability Techniques for State Space Models\n\n### Parameter Initialization Methods\n- The paper on Longhorn state space models highlights the importance of selecting the right objective functions for state-space model (SSM) design. It suggests viewing the recurrent update of SSMs as either a gradient descent step or a closed-form solution to an online learning objective. This perspective can help in designing stable and efficient initialization strategies.\n- For Gated State Space (GSS) models, careful initialization of the gating mechanisms is crucial. This can involve initializing the gates to balance forgetting and learning, similar to how Longhorn models use a closed-form update to stabilize the recurrent form without manual gating mechanisms.\n\n### Gradient Flow Management\n- Managing gradient flow is essential for numerical stability in deep architectures. The Longhorn paper discusses how the online learning perspective can help in understanding and stabilizing the state-transition dynamics of SSMs. This involves ensuring that the updates do not lead to exploding or vanishing gradients, which is critical for deep models.\n\n### Training Stability Considerations\n- Stability during training is a key consideration. The use of gated linear units (GLUs) in SSMs, as mentioned in the Longhorn paper, helps in stabilizing the output by controlling the flow of information through the gates. This ensures that the model does not suffer from numerical instability during deep sequence modeling.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Deep Learning\n\n### Efficient State Management\n- Efficient state management is vital for SSMs, especially when dealing with long sequences. The Longhorn model proposes using an SSM block for sequence mixing and an MLP block for channel mixing, which helps in maintaining sufficient information during recurrence without excessively large weights. This involves imposing low-dimensional structures on the mapping functions \\(A_t\\) and \\(B_t\\).\n- The DenseSSM paper suggests using dense hidden connections within state space models to improve efficiency while maintaining performance. This approach can help in optimizing memory usage by reducing the need for large weight matrices.\n\n### Memory-Compute Trade-offs\n- There is a trade-off between memory usage and computational complexity. SSMs offer lower computational complexity compared to Transformers but need careful design to maintain performance. The Efficient Long Sequence Modeling paper discusses how SSMs can augment global information efficiently, which helps in balancing this trade-off.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimizations\n- Hardware-aware optimizations are crucial for efficient training and inference. The use of parallel computation strategies, such as the PMBC (Parallel Membrane Bound Computation) strategy in spiking state space models, can significantly accelerate training and inference by leveraging FFT operations and parallel computing.\n\n## Test-Time Training Integration\n\n### Stability During Adaptation\n- For test-time training, stability during adaptation is critical. The Longhorn paper's online learning perspective can help in designing SSMs that adapt stably to new data. This involves ensuring that the model's state-transition dynamics remain stable even when the model is updated online.\n\n### Memory Management Strategies\n- Memory management during test-time training is essential. The Efficient Long Sequence Modeling paper suggests that integrating SSMs with other models (like Transformers) can help in managing memory efficiently while adapting to new sequences.\n- The PMBC strategy in spiking state space models provides a method to manage spiking signals efficiently during parallel computation, which can be adapted for test-time training in other SSM architectures.\n\n### Performance Impact\n- The performance impact of test-time training on SSMs needs careful consideration. The DenseSSM paper highlights that while SSMs offer computational efficiency, their performance needs to be optimized to rival that of Transformers. This involves ensuring that the model's adaptation during test-time does not compromise its overall performance.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design using state space models, researchers should focus on:\n\n- **Initialization and Stability**: Use online learning perspectives to design stable initialization strategies and manage gradient flow to ensure numerical stability.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Implement efficient state management techniques, such as low-dimensional structures and dense hidden connections, and leverage hardware-aware optimizations like parallel computation.\n- **Test-Time Training**: Ensure stability during adaptation, manage memory efficiently, and optimize the model's performance to maintain or improve its accuracy during test-time training.\n",

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num. AtTn Blocks | 0 (Mamba-2) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 15 | 24 | Transformer++ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Perplexity $\\downarrow$ | 8.60 | 8.38 | 8.32 | 8.29 | 8.29 | 8.28 | $\\mathbf{8 . 2 6}$ | 8.27 | 8.28 | 8.30 | 8.34 | 8.50 | 8.68 |\n\nHybrid Models with SSD, MLP, and Attention We compare different ways that SSD can be combined with the (gated) MLP and attention layers, and evaluate at the 2.7B scale (64 layers), trained to 300B tokens on the Pile (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set, same data order):\n\n1. Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold. We compare different ways SSD, MLP, and attention layers can be combined, evaluated at 2.7 B scale trained to 300 B tokens on the Pile. | MODEl | Token. | PILE <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | HellaSwag <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | PIQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-E <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-C <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | WinoGrande <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | OpenbookQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Average <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Transformer++ | NeoX | 6.13 | 3.99 | $\\underline{70.3}$ | 66.4 | 75.2 | 67.7 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 63.9 | 40.4 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2 | NeoX | 6.09 | 4.10 | 69.7 | 66.6 | 76.4 | 69.6 | 36.4 | 64.0 | 38.8 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP | NeoX | 6.13 | 4.18 | 69.3 | 65.0 | 76.4 | 68.1 | 37.0 | 63.1 | 38.2 | 59.6 |\n| Mamba-2-Attention | NeoX | 5.95 | 3.85 | 71.1 | 67.8 | $\\underline{75.8}$ | 69.9 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 65.3 | 39.0 | 61.0 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP-Attention | NeoX | 6.00 | 3.95 | 70.0 | 66.6 | 75.4 | 70.6 | 38.6 | 64.6 | 39.2 | 60.7 |\n\n### 9.3 Speed Benchmarks\n\nWe benchmark the speed of the SSD algorithm against Mamba's scan implementation and FlashAttention-2 (Figure 10). SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 2.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n#### 4.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"gated state space attention\", \"hybrid ssm architectures\", \"attention mechanisms ssm\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Pretraining Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated state space attention\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, J. Yan, Albert Gu, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in sequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs), and proposes a proposed model, Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), that combines SSM layers with a multiplicative gating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. While other architectures have been used, downstream accuracy is either significantly worse, or requires attention layers to match standard benchmarks such as GLUE. This work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in sequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs). Our proposed model, Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM layers with a multiplicative gating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling architectures. The model learns static layers that do not consider pair-wise interactions. Even so, BiGS is able to match BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE and can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without approximation. Analysis shows that while the models have similar average accuracy, the approach has different inductive biases than BERT in terms of interactions and syntactic representations.

Kersting, Taiji Suzuki, Brian Hie, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R'e, Ce Zhang, Stefano Massaroli*\n\n**TL;DR:** Results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid ssm architectures\"*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Prototype memory and attention mechanisms for few shot image generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"attention mechanisms ssm\"*\n\n*Tianqin Li, Zijie Li, Andrew Luo, Harold Rockwell, A. Farimani, T. Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors of macaque monkeys can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent discoveries indicate that the neural codes in the super\ufb01cial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys are complex, diverse and super-sparse. This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: \"attention mechanisms ssm\"*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid ssm architectures\"*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Orhan Firat, Christopher Pal, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nmodeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing\nto their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid ssm architectures\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem.

In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA).

Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"attention mechanisms ssm\"*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the\nattention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are\nexisting attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they\nhave limited ability to effectively compute global information.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated state space attention\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. U-Mamba: Enhancing Long-range Dependency for Biomedical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid ssm architectures\"*\n\n*Bo wang, Feifei Li, Jun Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been the most popular architectures for biomedical image segmentation, but both of them have limited ability to handle long-range dependencies because of inherent locality or computational complexity. To address this challenge, we introduce U-Mamba, a general-purpose network for biomedical image segmentation. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new family of deep sequence models known for their strong capability in handling long sequences, we design a hybrid CNN-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction power of convolutional layers with the abilities of SSMs for capturing the long-range dependency. Moreover, U-Mamba enjoys a self-configuring mechanism, allowing it to automatically adapt to various datasets without manual intervention. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse tasks, including the 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results reveal that U-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation networks across all tasks. This opens new avenues for efficient long-range dependency modeling in biomedical image analysis.

Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task. As for detection and segmentation, MambaOut cannot match the performance of state-of-the-art visual Mamba models, demonstrating the potential of Mamba for long-sequence visual tasks.

For example, the Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Retention Network (RetNet) are mentioned as variants that use linear attention, which can be seen as a form of attention mechanism integrated into SSMs.\n\n### Attention-like Mechanisms in SSMs\n- The same paper introduces models like Mamba, which uses a state-dependent linear projection followed by a channel mixing gated linear unit. This architecture can be viewed as incorporating attention-like mechanisms by dynamically adjusting the state based on input tokens.\n- Another example is the RWKV model, which maintains a state using elementwise recurrence and can be combined with local-attention (sliding-window self-attention) to enhance its capabilities.\n\n### Performance Comparisons\n- While the papers do not provide direct performance comparisons between SSMs with attention and traditional transformer models, they highlight the efficiency and potential of these hybrid models. For instance, the linear attention variants are shown to be efficient in computing outputs in parallel, which is a significant advantage over traditional recurrent models.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in State Space Models\n\n### Different Gating Architectures\n- The \"Longhorn\" paper describes several gating architectures within SSMs, such as the Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (HGRN2). This model uses a forget gate and an input gate similar to traditional RNNs but within the context of SSMs.\n- Another example is the Griffin architecture, which performs pure elementwise product and combines it with local-attention, showing a different approach to gating in SSMs.\n\n### Impact on Performance and Stability Considerations\n- The use of gating mechanisms in SSMs can improve performance by allowing the model to selectively retain or forget information. For example, the HGRN2 model's gating mechanism helps in maintaining sufficient information during recurrence, which is crucial for long-sequence modeling.\n- Stability is also a consideration, as proper initialization and parameterization of these gating mechanisms are critical for the model's performance and stability, as highlighted in the analysis note.\n\n## Combinations of SSMs with Other Architectures\n\n### Hybrid Models\n- The concept of hybrid models combining SSMs with other architectures is discussed in the context of integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms. For instance, the combination of SSMs with local-attention (as in the Griffin model) or the use of channel mixing gated linear units (as in Mamba) can be seen as hybrid approaches.\n\n### Performance Trade-offs and Implementation Considerations\n- Hybrid models can offer performance trade-offs by leveraging the strengths of both SSMs and other architectures. For example, the parallelizability of SSMs combined with the attention mechanisms can improve both efficiency and accuracy.\n- Implementation considerations include the need for careful initialization and parameterization to ensure stability and performance. Additionally, memory optimization techniques, such as those discussed in the analysis note, are crucial for efficient implementation.\n\nIn summary, the integration of attention mechanisms into SSMs, the use of gating mechanisms, and the creation of hybrid models are all promising avenues for improving autoregressive language model design. These approaches can enhance efficiency, stability, and performance, making them viable alternatives or complements to traditional transformer models.\n",
