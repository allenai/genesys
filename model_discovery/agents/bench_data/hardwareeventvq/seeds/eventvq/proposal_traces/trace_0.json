However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nKrzysztof Choromanski, Valerii Likhosherstov, David Dohan, Xingyou Song, Andreea Gane, Tam\u00e1s Sarl\u00f3s, Peter Hawkins, Jared Davis, Afroz Mohiuddin, Lukasz Kaiser, David Belanger, Lucy Colwell, and Adrian Weller. 2020.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

M-L2O: Towards Generalizable Learning-to-Optimize by Test-Time Fast Self-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Junjie Yang, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps, by proposing a proposed framework (termed as M-L2O).\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting\"specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 552  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 4. QDrop: Randomly Dropping Quantization for Extremely Low-bit Post-Training Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Xiuying Wei, Ruihao Gong, Yuhang Li, Xianglong Liu, F. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is pioneeringly confirmed that properly incorporating activation quantization into the PTQ reconstruction benefits the final accuracy, and a simple yet effective approach dubbed as QDROP is proposed, which randomly drops the quantization of activations during PTQ.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, post-training quantization (PTQ) has driven much attention to produce efficient neural networks without long-time retraining. Despite its low cost, current PTQ works tend to fail under the extremely low-bit setting. In this study, we pioneeringly confirm that properly incorporating activation quantization into the PTQ reconstruction benefits the final accuracy. To deeply understand the inherent reason, a theoretical framework is established, indicating that the flatness of the optimized low-bit model on calibration and test data is crucial. Based on the conclusion, a simple yet effective approach dubbed as QDROP is proposed, which randomly drops the quantization of activations during PTQ. Extensive experiments on various tasks including computer vision (image classification, object detection) and natural language processing (text classification and question answering) prove its superiority. With QDROP, the limit of PTQ is pushed to the 2-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy boost can be up to 51.49%. Without bells and whistles, QDROP establishes a new state of the art for PTQ.

Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven test-time training linear attention*\n\n*Kevin Clark, Kelvin Guu, Ming-Wei Chang, Panupong Pasupat, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Mohammad Norouzi*\n\n**TL;DR:** Fast Weight Layers are presented, a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention and can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic evaluation of language models (LMs) adapts model parameters at test time using gradient information from previous tokens and substantially improves LM performance. However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve an autoregressive language model by combining event-driven mechanisms with test-time training and integrating linear attention, here are some relevant findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and analysis:\n\n## Event-Driven Mechanisms and Test-Time Training\n\n1. **Event Sequence Diffusion Models**:\n   The paper on \"Future Motion Simulation via Event Sequence Diffusion\" discusses integrating event sequences with diffusion models, which could be a starting point for understanding how event-driven mechanisms can be aligned with real-world data through reinforcement learning. Although this paper is focused on motion forecasting, the concept of using event sequences and test-time prompt augmentation can be adapted to language models. For instance, events could trigger updates in the model's state during test-time training.\n\n## Linear Attention and Dynamic Updates\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**:\n   The work on \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" is relevant here. This research introduces gated linear attention, which can be integrated with event-driven updates. The gated mechanism can be modulated by events to enhance efficiency and expressiveness. This approach aligns with the idea of combining event detection with gated linear attention to leverage linear complexity while maintaining the model's expressiveness.\n\n## Efficient Implementations and State Management\n\n3. **Selective Computation and Hierarchical State Compression**:\n   The analysis of the parent designs highlights the importance of selective computation and hierarchical state compression. These techniques can be applied to test-time training to maintain efficiency. By using event detection to trigger selective computation during test-time updates, the model can reduce unnecessary computations and memory usage. This is in line with the rwkv6_event design's focus on selective computation and hierarchical state compression.\n\n## Recent Advances and Compatible Techniques\n\n4. **Time Series Forecasting Papers**:\n   While not directly focused on language models, papers on time series forecasting can provide insights into combining event-driven mechanisms with test-time training. For example, the \"TEST: Text Prototype Aligned Embedding to Activate LLM's Ability for Time Series\" paper discusses using text prototypes to activate large language models for time series forecasting, which involves test-time training. This concept can be adapted to language models by using events to trigger updates and align embeddings during test-time training.\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Comparisons\n\nTo implement these ideas, you would need to:\n\n- **Integrate Event Detection with Test-Time Training**: Use events to trigger updates in the model's state during test-time training. This can be done by monitoring input importance and selectively updating the model based on significant events.\n- **Combine Event Detection with Gated Linear Attention**: Modulate the attention gates using events to enhance efficiency and expressiveness. This involves integrating the event-driven mechanism with the gated linear attention to leverage linear complexity.\n- **Apply Hierarchical State Compression**: Use compression techniques to manage the model's state efficiently during test-time training. This ensures that the model remains efficient while incorporating dynamic updates.\n\n### Performance Comparisons\n\n- **Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis**: Compare the performance of the integrated model against state-of-the-art models using metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient-based test-time adaptation memory management*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Energy-Based Test Sample Adaptation for Domain Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: gradient-based test-time adaptation memory management*\n\n*Zehao Xiao, Xiantong Zhen, Shengcai Liao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** A discriminative energy-based model is designed, which is trained on source domains to jointly model the conditional distribution for classification and data distribution for sample adaptation, and is optimized to simultaneously learn a classifier and an energy function.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose energy-based sample adaptation at test time for domain generalization. Where previous works adapt their models to target domains, we adapt the unseen target samples to source-trained models. To this end, we design a discriminative energy-based model, which is trained on source domains to jointly model the conditional distribution for classification and data distribution for sample adaptation. The model is optimized to simultaneously learn a classifier and an energy function. To adapt target samples to source distributions, we iteratively update the samples by energy minimization with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. Moreover, to preserve the categorical information in the sample during adaptation, we introduce a categorical latent variable into the energy-based model. The latent variable is learned from the original sample before adaptation by variational inference and fixed as a condition to guide the sample update. Experiments on six benchmarks for classification of images and microblog threads demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Test-time Training for Matching-based Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient-based test-time adaptation memory management*\n\n*Juliette Bertrand, Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos, Yannis Kalantidis, Giorgos Tolias*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer and explores test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS.\n\n**Abstract:** The video object segmentation (VOS) task involves the segmentation of an object over time based on a single initial mask. Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: gradient-based test-time adaptation memory management*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. SODA: Robust Training of Test-Time Data Adaptors\n\n*From Search Query: gradient-based test-time adaptation memory management*\n\n*Zige Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Bo Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** P pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) is proposed, which leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction and can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting models deployed to test distributions can mitigate the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts. However, privacy concerns may render model parameters inaccessible. One promising approach involves utilizing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) to train a data adaptor to adapt the test data to fit the deployed models. Nevertheless, the data adaptor trained with ZOO typically brings restricted improvements due to the potential corruption of data features caused by the data adaptor. To address this issue, we revisit ZOO in the context of test-time data adaptation. We find that the issue directly stems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data adaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels assigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data adaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction. For data with low-confidence predictions, SODA encourages the adaptor to preserve data information to mitigate data corruption. Empirical results indicate that SODA can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on gradient-based test-time adaptation mechanisms, memory management, and efficient state updates, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Gradient-Based Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- The concept of expressing gradient updates as linear attention, as seen in Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), is promising. FWLs enable efficient parameter adaptation during inference by treating gradient updates as linear attention mechanisms. This approach is discussed in \"Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models\".\n\n## Memory Management\n\n- **Activation Checkpointing**: This technique can significantly reduce memory usage during training by clearing intermediate tensors and recomputing them during the backward pass. This method trades off extra computation time for reduced memory usage, which is particularly useful for large models. The details on how to implement activation checkpointing are provided in the AWS SageMaker documentation.\n\n- **Adaptive Gradient-Rank and Moments**: The paper on \"Adaptive Gradient-Rank and Moments for Memory-Efficient LLMs\" introduces a method that adaptively reduces the rank of gradients during Adam optimization steps. This approach significantly reduces memory requirements during training and fine-tuning of large language models by leveraging the decreasing rank of the estimated layer gradients over time.\n\n## Efficient State Updates\n\n- **Low-Rank Adaptation**: Techniques like GaLore and its variants (e.g., Q-GaLore, ReLoRA) focus on exploiting the low-rank structure of the gradient matrices to reduce memory usage. These methods allow for full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient than traditional low-rank adaptation methods.\n\n## Integration with Event Detection and Linear Attention\n\n- **Hierarchical State Compression**: Integrating event detection with hierarchical state compression can help manage memory growth efficiently. This can be combined with linear attention mechanisms to make gradient updates more efficient. While the specific integration details are not explicitly covered in the provided sources, the concept of hierarchical compression and its potential to manage memory growth is a key insight from the analysis note.\n\nIn summary, the following approaches can be explored to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design:\n\n- Implementing Fast Weight Layers (FWLs) for efficient gradient-based test-time adaptation.\n- Utilizing activation checkpointing to reduce memory usage during training.\n- Employing adaptive gradient-rank and moments techniques to reduce memory requirements during training and fine-tuning.\n- Integrating hierarchical state compression with linear attention mechanisms to manage memory and make gradient updates more efficient.\n\nThese strategies can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. TRAMS: Training-free Memory Selection for Long-range Language Modeling (Avg.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) is introduced, a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU memory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n#### 5. Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*M.

Ainslie, Chris Alberti, Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n, Philip Pham, Anirudh Ravula, Qifan Wang, Li Yang, Amr Ahmed*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 1631  (*Influential: 238*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/94 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2015. [3] J. Abreu, L. Fred, D. Mac\u00eado, and C. Zanchettin.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression attention mechanisms event detection*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information.

In this paper, we propose a novel Document Embedding Enhanced Bi-RNN model, called DEEB-RNN, to detect events in sentences. This model first learns event detection oriented embeddings of documents through a hierarchical and supervised attention based RNN, which pays word-level attention to event triggers and sentence-level attention to those sentences containing events. It then uses the learned document embedding to enhance another bidirectional RNN model to identify event triggers and their types in sentences.

HEDNet: A Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Network for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression attention mechanisms event detection*\n\n*Gang Zhang, Junnan Chen, Guohuan Gao, Jianmin Li, Xiaolin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** HEDNet is proposed, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder and decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects.\n\n**Abstract:** 3D object detection in point clouds is important for autonomous driving systems. A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency.

Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolutional Networks for Event Detection with dependency relations\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression attention mechanisms event detection*\n\n*Anan Liu, N. Xu, Haozhe Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolution Networks (SAGRCN) is proposed to mine node-to-node latent dependency relations via self-attention mechanism and introduce GraphResidual Network (GResNet) to solve graph information vanishing problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Event detection (ED) task aims to classify events by identifying key event trigger words embedded in a piece of text. Previous research have proved the validity of fusing syntactic dependency relations into Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN). While existing GCN-based methods explore latent node-to-node dependency relations according to a stationary adjacency tensor, an attention-based dynamic tensor, which can pay much attention to the key node like event trigger or its neighboring nodes, has not been developed. Simultaneously, suffering from the phenomenon of graph information vanishing caused by the symmetric adjacency tensor, existing GCN models can not achieve higher overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolution Networks (SAGRCN) to mine node-to-node latent dependency relations via self-attention mechanism and introduce Graph Residual Network (GResNet) to solve graph information vanishing problem. Specifically, a self-attention module is constructed to generate an attention tensor, representing the dependency attention scores of all words in the sentence. Furthermore, a graph residual term is added to the baseline SA-GCN to construct a GResNet. Considering the syntactically connection of the network input, we initialize the raw adjacency tensor without processed by the self-attention module as the residual term. We conduct experiments on the ACE2005 dataset and the results show significant improvement over competitive baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) by incorporating hierarchical compression techniques in attention mechanisms, particularly for event detection and dynamic state updates, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Techniques\n\n- **Hierarchical State Compression**: This involves breaking down the state into multiple levels of granularity to reduce memory usage. For example, using low-rank adaptations or hierarchical representations can help in compressing the state efficiently. The concept of \"Weighted Grouped Query Attention (WGQA)\" mentioned in the analysis note can be extended to include hierarchical compression, where attention is computed in a grouped and hierarchical manner to reduce computational and memory costs.\n\n## Integration with Event Detection\n\n- **Event-Driven Mechanisms**: Integrating event detection can help in triggering selective test-time updates. This means that the model can adapt dynamically based on the detection of specific events or changes in the input data. For instance, using event detection to trigger updates can be combined with nearest neighbor-based adaptation methods to fine-tune the model on relevant data at test time.\n\n## Dynamic State Updates\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization and Caching**: Techniques like adaptive normalization layers and selective caching can help in maintaining stable and accurate predictions while reducing memory overhead. These methods can be integrated with hierarchical compression to ensure efficient state updates. For example, \"MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Adaptation\" suggests reducing batch sizes and using adaptive normalization to maintain performance while reducing memory usage.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **PagedAttention and Linear Attention**: Efficient memory management techniques such as PagedAttention can be adapted for handling large-scale language model inference with dynamic sequence lengths. Combining these with hierarchical compression and linear attention mechanisms can further optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\n## Specific Implementations\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly discuss hierarchical compression in attention mechanisms for event detection, the following insights can be derived:\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: Implementing hierarchical attention mechanisms involves dividing the attention process into multiple layers or groups, each handling a different level of detail. This can be combined with event detection to focus attention on relevant parts of the input data dynamically.\n- **Dynamic State Management**: Techniques like weighted grouped query attention and low-rank adaptations can be used to manage and update the model's state efficiently, especially when integrated with event-driven mechanisms.\n\nTo further investigate, you may need to look into recent research papers or conference proceedings that specifically address hierarchical compression in attention mechanisms, such as those presented at conferences like ICLR, NeurIPS, or ACL.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **Search for Papers on Hierarchical Attention**:\n   - Look for papers that discuss hierarchical attention mechanisms and their application in autoregressive language models.\n   - Check for implementations that combine hierarchical attention with event detection and dynamic state updates.\n\n2. **Integration with Event Detection**:\n   - Investigate how event detection can be used to trigger selective updates in the model.\n   - Explore papers that discuss the integration of event-driven mechanisms with test-time adaptation techniques.\n\n3. **Efficient Implementations**:\n   - Search for efficient implementations of combined linear and grouped attention mechanisms.\n   - Look into how these can be optimized using hierarchical compression and adaptive normalization techniques.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can gather the necessary information to improve the design of autoregressive language models with hierarchical compression, event detection, and efficient state updates.\n",

In this paper, we present Transformer-VQ, a transformer decoder with dense self-attention computible in linear time with respect to sequence length. This is made possible through a combination of vectorquantized keys, localized positional biases, and compressive cache that can be attended to efficiently, while yielding the same results as an uncompressed variable-length cache. Transformer-VQ is also simple to implement sampling for. ## 2 PRELIMINARIES\n\n### 2.1 NOTATION\n\nThe real numbers are denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$ and the extended real numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty, \\infty\\}$ by $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$. Zero-based indices are used for all tensors. When indexing a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ along the first axis, we use $\\mathbf{M}_{i}$ to denote a column vector and $\\mathbf{M}_{i,:}$ to denote a row vector. The functions $\\operatorname{LN}(\\cdot)$, Softmax $(\\cdot)$, Concat $(\\cdot)$ denote LayerNorm (Ba et al. 2016), softmax, and concatenation, each applied row-wise. The symbols $\\triangleq, \\propto, \\odot, \\exp (\\cdot), \\delta_{a, b}, \\mathrm{SG}(\\cdot)$ denote equality by definition, proportionality, element-wise product, element-wise exponentiation, Kronecker delta function, and the stop-gradient operator. We slightly abuse notation to write inner products of vectors $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}$ as $\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}$, and outer products as $\\mathbf{u v}^{\\top}$. We assume familiarity with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), and use the notation $D_{m}$ to denote the model width, $D_{k}$ to denote the query/key vector width, and $D_{v}$ to denote the value vector width. ### 2.2 VECTOR QUANTIZATION\n\nVector quantization (VQ) is a technique used extensively throughout this work. In this subsection we briefly review vector quantization, motivate its use in self-attention, and discuss the backpropagationcompatible VQ scheme introduced by van den Oord et al. (2017). ### 2.3 VECTOR QUANTIZERS AND CODEBOOKS\n\nDefinition 2.1. A vector quantizer is a function $\\operatorname{VQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ with domain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. For an input $\\mathbf{x}$, its output $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& z \\triangleq \\underset{s}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\triangleq \\mathbf{C}_{z}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times D}$ is known as the codebook. The row indices $\\{0, \\ldots, S-1\\}$ of $\\mathbf{C}$ are called shortcodes, and the rows themselves are called codewords. Theorem 2.2 (Based on Guo et al. (2019)). Let $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable with $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\left[\\mathbf{q q}^{\\top}\\right]=\\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{I}_{D}$ for some $\\sigma>0$, and let $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable independent of $\\mathbf{q}$. Let $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R}^{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a deterministic function. Then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2} \\propto \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold. Given the constraint that $\\varphi\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\right)=\\left\\{\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\}_{s=0}^{S-1}$, the choice $\\varphi(\\cdot)=V Q(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ minimizes $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2}$. Corollary 2.4. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold. With $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}=V Q(\\mathbf{k} ; \\mathbf{C})$ we have\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathbf{C}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\right\\|^{2}=\\underset{\\mathbf{C}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nRemark 2.5. Fnding the global minimizer $\\mathbf{C}^{*}=\\arg \\min _{\\mathbf{C}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\|^{2}$ is expensive, so in practice we approximate it using the method from van den Oord et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/49 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2017); Razavi et al. (2019). ### 2.4 VECTOR-QUANTIZED REPRESENTATION LEARNING\n\nDefinition 2.6 (Based on van den Oord et al. (2017)). A vector-quantizer with straight-through estimator is a function $\\operatorname{STVQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ with domain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. For an input $\\mathbf{x}$, its output $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& z \\triangleq \\underset{s}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\triangleq \\mathbf{x}+\\operatorname{SG}\\left(\\mathbf{C}_{z}-\\mathbf{x}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemark 2.7. For any $\\mathrm{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}, \\operatorname{STVQ}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\mathbf{C})$ evaluates to $\\operatorname{VQ}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\mathbf{C})$. However, for purposes of backpropagation, the Jacobian of the quantizer w.r.t. its input will now be an identity matrix everywhere, instead of a zero matrix almost everywhere. Intuitively, when using STVQ, gradients w.r.t. the quantizer outputs are copied 'straight through' to the inputs. Remark 2.8. We overload the notation $\\operatorname{STVQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ to operate row-wise on matrix-valued inputs. ## 3 TRANSFORMER-VQ\n\nWe now propose Transformer-VQ, a decoder-only transformer that can compute dense self-attention in linear time. Proofs for all theoretical results are given in Appendix A. ### 3.1 QUADRATIC-TiME FORMULATION\n\nDefinition 3.1. Vector-Quantized Self-Attention is a function VQAttn($\\cdot$; $\\left.\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{W}_{\\{Q, K, V, G, O\\}}\\right)$ with domain $\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{m}}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{m}}$. For an input $\\mathbf{X}$, its output $\\mathbf{Y}$ is defined via\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\triangleq \\mathbf{L N}(\\mathbf{X}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{m}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{Q} \\triangleq \\tau^{-0.5} \\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{k}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{K} \\triangleq \\tau^{-0.5} \\mathbf{L N}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\mathbf{W}_{K}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{k}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{V} \\triangleq \\phi_{v}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\mathbf{W}_{V}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{v}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{G} \\triangleq \\phi_{g}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} \\mathbf{W}_{G}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{v}} \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{K}} \\triangleq \\operatorname{STVQ}(\\mathbf{K} ; \\mathbf{C}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{k}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{W} \\triangleq \\phi_{w}\\left(\\mathbf{Q} \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{B}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{O} \\triangleq(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{V}) \\odot \\mathbf{G} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{v}} \\\\\n& \\mathbf{Y} \\triangleq \\mathbf{X}+\\mathbf{O} \\mathbf{W}_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D_{m}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere each $\\mathbf{W}_{\\bullet}$ denotes a trainable projection, $\\mathbf{B}$ denotes positional biases and/or mask, $\\tau$ is a fixed constant, and the $\\phi_{v}, \\phi_{g}, \\phi_{w}$ are element-wise or row-wise nonlinearities. The query/key LayerNorms use unit gain and zero bias, and $\\operatorname{STVQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ denotes row-wise application of vector-quantization with a straight-through gradient estimator (van den Oord et al., 2017). Remark 3.2. Our attention mechanism is applied to a gated attention unit (GAU) design inspired by Hua et al. (2022). GAU is a single-headed gated attention mechanism and generally uses a small key width $D_{k}=128$, and a large value width $D_{v}=2 D_{m}$, with two GAUs replacing a single transformer layer.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/49 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nFollowing van den Oord et al. (2017); Razavi et al. (2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/49 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\n# TranSFORMER-VQ\uff1aLINEAR-TiME TRANSFORMERS VIA VECTOR QUANTIZATION \n\nLucas D.

Since the green keys $k_{2}, k_{5}$ map to the same code, they have the same attention weights in this attention head. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nTransformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) language models would ideally scale to long sequences, since their predictive abilities often improve as context length increases (Dai et al., 2019, Kaplan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the standard transformer uses a self-attention mechanism with a quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length. This limits the practicality of applying transformers to very long sequences, since increasing the sequence length by a factor of $10^{n}$ increases the attention computations by a factor of $100^{n}$. Transformer variants that overcome this efficiency bottleneck have the potential to facilitate new long-context applications and enable new breakthroughs. Up to this point, a variety of efficient transformers (Tay et al., 2020b) have been proposed to scale to long sequences. Techniques include sparsity (Child et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020. Kitaev et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020; Roy et al.| 2021; Tay et al., 2020a; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, Wu et al.||2022|, Liu et al.|| 2023; Zhang et al.||2023), compression (Liu et al.||2018; Rae et al. 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zhu et al.| 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Nawrot et al., 2021; 2023), low-rank approximations (Wang et al. 2020; Vyas et al., 2020, Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2021, Tay et al. 2021, Choromanski et al., 2021), and cross-attention operations (Dai et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2021; Hutchins et al., 2022;, Hawthorne et al., 2022). Other efficient sequence models have also been proposed (Gu et al., 2022; Lee-Thorp et al. 2022; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022, Hasani et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/49 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\n2022), GSS (Mehta et al. 2022), MEGA (Ma et al. 2023) and RWKV (Peng et al. 2023). Transformer-VQ uses the original gating formulation from Hua et al. (2022), and develops a new attention mechanism. ### 4.5 VQ, K-MEANS, AND BEYOND\n\nIdeas relating to $k$-means, vector quantization, and/or codebooks have also been applied in transformers for sparse attention (Roy et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; 2022), feature learning (Mao et al., 2022, Roy et al., 2022), sparsely-activated MLPs (Lample et al. 2019), and expert selection (Roller et al. 2021). These works generally feature codebooks or similar within a transformer architecture. Several works also have proposed models that feature a codebook somewhere outside a transformer, e.g., when transformers are priors for VQ-VAEs (Kaiser et al., 2018; Dhariwal et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: vector quantization attention compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. CLaM-TTS: Improving Neural Codec Language Model for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*Jaehyeon Kim, Keon Lee, Seungjun Chung, Jaewoong Cho*\n\n**TL;DR:** CLaM-TTS is presented that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to achieve superior compression in the token length, and allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams.\n\n**Abstract:** With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*Rithesh Kumar, Prem Seetharaman, Alejandro Luebs, I.

A key component of these models is a high quality neural compression model that can compress high-dimensional natural signals into lower dimensional discrete tokens. To that end, we introduce a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves ~90x compression of 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth. We achieve this by combining advances in high-fidelity audio generation with better vector quantization techniques from the image domain, along with improved adversarial and reconstruction losses. We compress all domains (speech, environment, music, etc.) with a single universal model, making it widely applicable to generative modeling of all audio. We compare with competing audio compression algorithms, and find our method outperforms them significantly. We provide thorough ablations for every design choice, as well as open-source code and trained model weights. We hope our work can lay the foundation for the next generation of high-fidelity audio modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 171  (*Influential: 39*)\n\n#### 4.

Model compression via distillation and quantization\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*A. Polino, Razvan Pascanu, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes two new compression methods, which jointly leverage weight quantization and distillation of larger teacher networks into smaller student networks, and shows that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) continue to make significant advances, solving tasks from image classification to translation or reinforcement learning. One aspect of the field receiving considerable attention is efficiently executing deep models in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded devices. This paper focuses on this problem, and proposes two new compression methods, which jointly leverage weight quantization and distillation of larger teacher networks into smaller student networks. The first method we propose is called quantized distillation and leverages distillation during the training process, by incorporating distillation loss, expressed with respect to the teacher, into the training of a student network whose weights are quantized to a limited set of levels. The second method, differentiable quantization, optimizes the location of quantization points through stochastic gradient descent, to better fit the behavior of the teacher model. We validate both methods through experiments on convolutional and recurrent architectures. We show that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models, while providing order of magnitude compression, and inference speedup that is linear in the depth reduction. In sum, our results enable DNNs for resource-constrained environments to leverage architecture and accuracy advances developed on more powerful devices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 670  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding for Template-based Music Generation\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*L\u00e9opold Crestel, Ga\u00ebtan Hadjeres*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a flexible method for generating variations of discrete sequences in which tokens can be grouped into basic units, like sentences in a text or bars in music. More precisely, given a template sequence, we aim at producing novel sequences sharing perceptible similarities with the original template without relying on any annotation; so our problem of generating variations is intimately linked to the problem of learning relevant high-level representations without supervision. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we propose a self-supervised encoding technique, named Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding which allows to learn a meaningful assignment of the basic units over a discrete set of codes, together with mechanisms allowing to control the information content of these learnt discrete representations. Secondly, we show how these compressed representations can be used to generate variations of a template sequence by using an appropriate attention pattern in the Transformer architecture. We illustrate our approach on the corpus of J.S. Bach chorales where we discuss the musical meaning of the learnt discrete codes and show that our proposed method allows to generate coherent and high-quality variations of a given template.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Predicting Video with VQVAE\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*A\u00e4ron van den Oord, Ali Razavi, Jacob Walker*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, the task of video prediction-forecasting future video given past video frames-has attracted attention in the research community. In this paper we propose a novel approach to this problem with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). With VQ-VAE we compress high-resolution videos into a hierarchical set of multi-scale discrete latent variables. Compared to pixels, this compressed latent space has dramatically reduced dimensionality, allowing us to apply scalable autoregressive generative models to predict video. In contrast to previous work that has largely emphasized highly constrained datasets, we focus on very diverse, large-scale datasets such as Kinetics-600. We predict video at a higher resolution on unconstrained videos, 256x256, than any other previous method to our knowledge. We further validate our approach against prior work via a crowdsourced human evaluation.\n\n**Conference:** predicting-video-with-vqvae\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. Megapixel Image Generation with Step-Unrolled Denoising Autoencoders\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization attention compression*\n\n*Chris G. Willcocks, Alex F. McKinney*\n\n**Abstract:** An ongoing trend in generative modelling research has been to push sample resolutions higher whilst simultaneously reducing computational requirements for training and sampling. We aim to push this trend further via the combination of techniques - each component representing the current pinnacle of efficiency in their respective areas. These include vector-quantized GAN (VQ-GAN), a vector-quantization (VQ) model capable of high levels of lossy - but perceptually insignificant - compression; hourglass transformers, a highly scaleable self-attention model; and step-unrolled denoising autoencoders (SUNDAE), a non-autoregressive (NAR) text generative model. Unexpectedly, our method highlights weaknesses in the original formulation of hourglass transformers when applied to multidimensional data. In light of this, we propose modifications to the resampling mechanism, applicable in any task applying hierarchical transformers to multidimensional data. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of SUNDAE to long sequence lengths - four times longer than prior work. Our proposed framework scales to high-resolutions ($1024 \\times 1024$) and trains quickly (2-4 days). Crucially, the trained model produces diverse and realistic megapixel samples in approximately 2 seconds on a consumer-grade GPU (GTX 1080Ti). In general, the framework is flexible: supporting an arbitrary number of sampling steps, sample-wise self-stopping, self-correction capabilities, conditional generation, and a NAR formulation that allows for arbitrary inpainting masks. We obtain FID scores of 10.56 on FFHQ256 - close to the original VQ-GAN in less than half the sampling steps - and 21.85 on FFHQ1024 in only 100 sampling steps.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using vector quantization techniques, particularly in the context of attention mechanisms, event detection, and dynamic updates, here are some key insights and relevant papers:\n\n## Vector Quantization in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Residual Vector Quantization for KV Cache Compression**: This approach, discussed in, applies residual vector quantization to compress key and value matrices in large language models. It shows that vector quantization can be effective in reducing memory requirements without significant performance drops. This method involves scaling vectors by their standard deviation, grouping channels, and quantizing each group, which can be adapted for attention mechanisms to reduce computational and memory costs.\n\n## Integration with Event Detection and Dynamic Updates\n\n- **Selective State Updates**: The concept of selective state updates, as seen in \"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\"[Analysis Note], can be integrated with vector quantization. By selectively propagating or forgetting information based on content importance, the model can efficiently manage its state and update it dynamically. This can be combined with event-driven updates to trigger compression or decompression, ensuring that only relevant information is retained and processed[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Transformer-VQ**: This method, mentioned in the analysis note, uses vector quantization to achieve linear-time attention. It does not rely on token contiguity, making it more flexible and efficient for compressing attention weights. This approach can be particularly useful for reducing the computational complexity of attention mechanisms in autoregressive models[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Management and Hierarchical Representations\n\n- **Adaptive KV Cache Compression**: Papers like \"Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\" discuss adaptive methods for compressing KV cache, which can be integrated with hierarchical state representations. These methods reduce the memory footprint of generative inference and can be optimized for dynamic updates and event detection.\n\n## Specific Implementations and Hardware Efficiency\n\n- **SimLayerKV and DuoAttention**: These methods, discussed in, focus on reducing inter-layer KV cache redundancies and using lightweight KV caches for streaming heads. These approaches can be combined with vector quantization to achieve hardware-efficient implementations that balance compression ratio and model performance.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Vector Quantization**: Techniques like residual vector quantization can be applied to compress attention weights and KV cache, reducing memory and computational costs.\n- **Selective State Updates**: Integrating content-based reasoning and event-driven updates can enhance the efficiency of state management and compression[Analysis Note].\n- **Hierarchical Representations**: Using hierarchical state representations can enable efficient multi-level state management and updates[Analysis Note].\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Implementations such as SimLayerKV and DuoAttention can help in achieving hardware-efficient solutions that are crucial for deploying large language models.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage vector quantization, selective state updates, and adaptive compression strategies.\n",

The colorful and blank boxes depict the keys and attention weights, respectively. The keys on the right have been vector-quantized. Since the green keys $k_{2}, k_{5}$ map to the same code, they have the same attention weights in this attention head. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nTransformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) language models would ideally scale to long sequences, since their predictive abilities often improve as context length increases (Dai et al., 2019, Kaplan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the standard transformer uses a self-attention mechanism with a quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length. This limits the practicality of applying transformers to very long sequences, since increasing the sequence length by a factor of $10^{n}$ increases the attention computations by a factor of $100^{n}$. Transformer variants that overcome this efficiency bottleneck have the potential to facilitate new long-context applications and enable new breakthroughs. Up to this point, a variety of efficient transformers (Tay et al., 2020b) have been proposed to scale to long sequences. Techniques include sparsity (Child et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020. Kitaev et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020; Roy et al.| 2021; Tay et al., 2020a; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, Wu et al.||2022|, Liu et al.|| 2023; Zhang et al.||2023), compression (Liu et al.||2018; Rae et al. 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zhu et al.| 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Nawrot et al., 2021; 2023), low-rank approximations (Wang et al. 2020; Vyas et al., 2020, Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2021, Tay et al. 2021, Choromanski et al., 2021), and cross-attention operations (Dai et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2021; Hutchins et al., 2022;, Hawthorne et al., 2022). Other efficient sequence models have also been proposed (Gu et al., 2022; Lee-Thorp et al. 2022; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022, Hasani et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/49 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n2022, Poli et al., 2023, Peng et al. 2023). In this paper, we present Transformer-VQ, a transformer decoder with dense self-attention computible in linear time with respect to sequence length. This is made possible through a combination of vectorquantized keys, localized positional biases, and compressive cache that can be attended to efficiently, while yielding the same results as an uncompressed variable-length cache. Transformer-VQ is also simple to implement sampling for. ## 2 PRELIMINARIES\n\n### 2.1 NOTATION\n\nThe real numbers are denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$ and the extended real numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty, \\infty\\}$ by $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$. Zero-based indices are used for all tensors. When indexing a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ along the first axis, we use $\\mathbf{M}_{i}$ to denote a column vector and $\\mathbf{M}_{i,:}$ to denote a row vector. The functions $\\operatorname{LN}(\\cdot)$, Softmax $(\\cdot)$, Concat $(\\cdot)$ denote LayerNorm (Ba et al. 2016), softmax, and concatenation, each applied row-wise. The symbols $\\triangleq, \\propto, \\odot, \\exp (\\cdot), \\delta_{a, b}, \\mathrm{SG}(\\cdot)$ denote equality by definition, proportionality, element-wise product, element-wise exponentiation, Kronecker delta function, and the stop-gradient operator. We slightly abuse notation to write inner products of vectors $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}$ as $\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}$, and outer products as $\\mathbf{u v}^{\\top}$. We assume familiarity with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), and use the notation $D_{m}$ to denote the model width, $D_{k}$ to denote the query/key vector width, and $D_{v}$ to denote the value vector width. ### 2.2 VECTOR QUANTIZATION\n\nVector quantization (VQ) is a technique used extensively throughout this work. In this subsection we briefly review vector quantization, motivate its use in self-attention, and discuss the backpropagationcompatible VQ scheme introduced by van den Oord et al. (2017). ### 2.3 VECTOR QUANTIZERS AND CODEBOOKS\n\nDefinition 2.1. A vector quantizer is a function $\\operatorname{VQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ with domain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. For an input $\\mathbf{x}$, its output $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& z \\triangleq \\underset{s}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\triangleq \\mathbf{C}_{z}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times D}$ is known as the codebook. The row indices $\\{0, \\ldots, S-1\\}$ of $\\mathbf{C}$ are called shortcodes, and the rows themselves are called codewords. Theorem 2.2 (Based on Guo et al. (2019)). Let $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable with $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\left[\\mathbf{q q}^{\\top}\\right]=\\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{I}_{D}$ for some $\\sigma>0$, and let $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable independent of $\\mathbf{q}$. Let $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R}^{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a deterministic function. Then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2} \\propto \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold. Given the constraint that $\\varphi\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\right)=\\left\\{\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\}_{s=0}^{S-1}$, the choice $\\varphi(\\cdot)=V Q(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ minimizes $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2}$. Corollary 2.4. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold. With $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}=V Q(\\mathbf{k} ; \\mathbf{C})$ we have\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathbf{C}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\right\\|^{2}=\\underset{\\mathbf{C}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nRemark 2.5. Fnding the global minimizer $\\mathbf{C}^{*}=\\arg \\min _{\\mathbf{C}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\|^{2}$ is expensive, so in practice we approximate it using the method from van den Oord et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/49 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n2020; Ramesh et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2022, Zhou et al. 2022).

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/43 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. $1631-1642,2013$.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization language models adaptive compression*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 44  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3.

We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights being even in magnitude and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

QLLM: Accurate and Efficient Low-Bitwidth Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization language models adaptive compression*\n\n*Jing Liu, Ruihao Gong, Xiuying Wei, Zhiwei Dong, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang*\n\n**TL;DR:** QLLM is proposed, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs that introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their widespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes. Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SNAC: Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization language models adaptive compression*\n\n*Luca A. Lanzend\u00f6rfer, Florian Gr\u00f6tschla, Hubert Siuzdak*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural audio codecs have recently gained popularity because they can represent audio signals with high fidelity at very low bitrates, making it feasible to use language modeling approaches for audio generation and understanding. Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become the standard technique for neural audio compression using a cascade of VQ codebooks. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Neural Audio Codec, a simple extension of RVQ where the quantizers can operate at different temporal resolutions. By applying a hierarchy of quantizers at variable frame rates, the codec adapts to the audio structure across multiple timescales. This leads to more efficient compression, as demonstrated by extensive objective and subjective evaluations.

ComPEFT: Compression for Communicating Parameter Efficient Updates via Sparsification and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization language models adaptive compression*\n\n*Mohit Bansal, Colin Raffel, Leshem Choshen, Prateek Yadav*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create \"expert\" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

Residual vector quantization for KV cache compression in large language model\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization language models adaptive compression*\n\n*Ankur Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using vector quantization, adaptive compression, and event-driven computation, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Vector Quantization Techniques in Transformer and RNN Architectures\n\n- **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ):** This technique is extensively discussed in the context of neural audio compression and can be adapted for language models. RVQ involves a cascade of vector quantization layers, which can be hierarchical and multi-scale, reducing memory requirements and improving generalization capabilities.\n- **Graph Quantized Tokenizer (GQT):** This approach uses RVQ to quantize graph neural network (GNN) representations into discrete tokens, which can be applied to language models to reduce memory usage and enhance inference efficiency. The GQT combines RVQ with token modulation to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.\n\n## Adaptive Compression Methods for Neural Network States\n\n- **Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Quantization:** The multi-scale residual vector quantization approach described in the SNAC model involves downsampling and upsampling residuals, which can be adapted for hierarchical state compression in language models. This method improves efficiency and quality by using multiple temporal resolutions.\n- **Adaptive Codebook Selection:** The EventVQ proposal suggests using adaptive codebook selection based on events, which can be a novel approach for language models. This involves dynamically adjusting the codebooks based on the input complexity, potentially leading to better compression ratios without compromising model quality[Initial Analysis of EventVQ Proposal].\n\n## Event-Driven Computation in Language Models\n\n- **Event-Driven Vector Quantization (EDVQ):** The EventVQ proposal integrates event detection with vector quantization, allowing for selective and adaptive updates of the model states. This approach can significantly reduce computational overhead by only updating states when necessary, based on detected events[Initial Analysis of EventVQ Proposal].\n\n## Implementation Details of Efficient Attention Mechanisms with Compression\n\n- **Local Windowed Attention Layers:** The SNAC model incorporates local windowed attention layers at the lowest temporal resolution, which can be efficient for language models. This approach, combined with depthwise convolutions, helps in reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.\n- **Hierarchical Quantized States (HQS) and Selective Quantized Attention (SQA):** These components of the EventVQ proposal involve compressing states hierarchically and using selective attention mechanisms. This can lead to efficient attention mechanisms that balance compression and model quality[Initial Analysis of EventVQ Proposal].\n\n## Training Stability with Adaptive Components\n\n- **Training Dynamics and Stability:** The use of RVQ and adaptive codebooks in the GQT and SNAC models highlights the importance of stable training dynamics. Ensuring that the model remains stable during training, especially with multiple adaptive components, is crucial. This involves careful tuning of hyperparameters and potentially using techniques like layer normalization and multi-head attention to maintain stability[Initial Analysis of EventVQ Proposal].\n- **Hardware Efficiency Considerations:** The EventVQ proposal also emphasizes the need for hardware-friendly designs. Using linear attention mechanisms and efficient state update strategies can help in achieving better hardware efficiency, which is essential for scalable and efficient language models[Initial Analysis of EventVQ Proposal].\n\nIn summary, the integration of residual vector quantization, hierarchical and multi-scale quantization, event-driven computation, and efficient attention mechanisms can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models. These approaches can enhance computational efficiency, reduce memory usage, and maintain or improve model quality. However, careful consideration of training stability and hardware efficiency is necessary to fully leverage these advancements.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.79)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/27 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1602.02830, 2016.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nVol. 34. 05. 2020, pp. 7432-7439.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/49 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n2022, Poli et al., 2023, Peng et al. 2023). In this paper, we present Transformer-VQ, a transformer decoder with dense self-attention computible in linear time with respect to sequence length. This is made possible through a combination of vectorquantized keys, localized positional biases, and compressive cache that can be attended to efficiently, while yielding the same results as an uncompressed variable-length cache. Transformer-VQ is also simple to implement sampling for. ## 2 PRELIMINARIES\n\n### 2.1 NOTATION\n\nThe real numbers are denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$ and the extended real numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty, \\infty\\}$ by $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$. Zero-based indices are used for all tensors. When indexing a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ along the first axis, we use $\\mathbf{M}_{i}$ to denote a column vector and $\\mathbf{M}_{i,:}$ to denote a row vector. The functions $\\operatorname{LN}(\\cdot)$, Softmax $(\\cdot)$, Concat $(\\cdot)$ denote LayerNorm (Ba et al. 2016), softmax, and concatenation, each applied row-wise. The symbols $\\triangleq, \\propto, \\odot, \\exp (\\cdot), \\delta_{a, b}, \\mathrm{SG}(\\cdot)$ denote equality by definition, proportionality, element-wise product, element-wise exponentiation, Kronecker delta function, and the stop-gradient operator. We slightly abuse notation to write inner products of vectors $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}$ as $\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}$, and outer products as $\\mathbf{u v}^{\\top}$. We assume familiarity with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), and use the notation $D_{m}$ to denote the model width, $D_{k}$ to denote the query/key vector width, and $D_{v}$ to denote the value vector width. ### 2.2 VECTOR QUANTIZATION\n\nVector quantization (VQ) is a technique used extensively throughout this work. In this subsection we briefly review vector quantization, motivate its use in self-attention, and discuss the backpropagationcompatible VQ scheme introduced by van den Oord et al. (2017). ### 2.3 VECTOR QUANTIZERS AND CODEBOOKS\n\nDefinition 2.1. A vector quantizer is a function $\\operatorname{VQ}(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ with domain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. For an input $\\mathbf{x}$, its output $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& z \\triangleq \\underset{s}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\triangleq \\mathbf{C}_{z}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times D}$ is known as the codebook. The row indices $\\{0, \\ldots, S-1\\}$ of $\\mathbf{C}$ are called shortcodes, and the rows themselves are called codewords. Theorem 2.2 (Based on Guo et al. (2019)). Let $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable with $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\left[\\mathbf{q q}^{\\top}\\right]=\\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{I}_{D}$ for some $\\sigma>0$, and let $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a random variable independent of $\\mathbf{q}$. Let $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R}^{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ be a deterministic function. Then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2} \\propto \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\|\\mathbf{k}-\\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold. Given the constraint that $\\varphi\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\right)=\\left\\{\\mathbf{C}_{s}\\right\\}_{s=0}^{S-1}$, the choice $\\varphi(\\cdot)=V Q(\\cdot ; \\mathbf{C})$ minimizes $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}^{\\top} \\varphi(\\mathbf{k})\\right\\|^{2}$. Corollary 2.4. Let the conditions of Theorem 2.2 hold.

Unfortunately, the standard transformer uses a self-attention mechanism with a quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length. This limits the practicality of applying transformers to very long sequences, since increasing the sequence length by a factor of $10^{n}$ increases the attention computations by a factor of $100^{n}$. Transformer variants that overcome this efficiency bottleneck have the potential to facilitate new long-context applications and enable new breakthroughs. Up to this point, a variety of efficient transformers (Tay et al., 2020b) have been proposed to scale to long sequences. Techniques include sparsity (Child et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020. Kitaev et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020; Roy et al.| 2021; Tay et al., 2020a; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, Wu et al.||2022|, Liu et al.|| 2023; Zhang et al.||2023), compression (Liu et al.||2018; Rae et al. 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zhu et al.| 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Nawrot et al., 2021; 2023), low-rank approximations (Wang et al. 2020; Vyas et al., 2020, Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2021, Tay et al. 2021, Choromanski et al., 2021), and cross-attention operations (Dai et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2021; Hutchins et al., 2022;, Hawthorne et al., 2022). Other efficient sequence models have also been proposed (Gu et al., 2022; Lee-Thorp et al. 2022; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022, Hasani et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 4 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: vector quantization transformers hardware efficiency training stability\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization transformers hardware efficiency training stability*\n\n*Z. Yao, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Minjia Zhang, Xiaoxia Wu, Conglong Li, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work is able to show that ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference.\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 309  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. PackQViT: Faster Sub-8-bit Vision Transformers via Full and Packed Quantization on the Mobile\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization transformers hardware efficiency training stability*\n\n*Peiyan Dong, Lei Lu, Chao Wu, Cheng Lyu, Geng Yuan, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making and develops a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT Acceleration on mobile phones.\n\n**Abstract:** While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have undoubtedly made impressive strides in computer vision (CV), their intricate network structures necessitate substantial computation and memory resources. A decision-making process for CV tasks typically entails performing computations with low latency, which is a tricky problem for ViT models. Model quantization is a widely-used technique to optimize the hardware ef\ufb01ciency of deep neural networks. Full quantization under Sub-8-bit precision, in particular, is a promising solution to reduce inference latency significantly. Unfortunately, current commodity hardware, such as CPUs and GPUs, still struggles to ef\ufb01ciently execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks, as their SIMD instructions only support a granularity of 8 bits or wider. Also, there is a scarcity of literature that presents a full quantization paradigm for ViTs. In this paper, we propose an activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making. Speci\ufb01cally, in revisiting data activation within the ViT data\ufb02ow, two characteristics are relevant to quantization strategy and precision: the long-tailed distribution and systematic channel-wise outliers. In response, we employ either log2 quantization or clipping to address the long-tailed distribution and incorporate outlier-aware training for residual link quantization to regulate the various channel-wise outliers more consistently. Notably, due to the systematic \ufb01xed pattern, outlier-aware training approach can predict the channel indices and regularized scales of outliers in advance, thus avoiding the runtime data-adaptive selection during inference. Furthermore, we employ Int-2 n -Softmax, Int-LayerNorm, and Integer GELU to enable integer-only computation \ufb02ow. Finally, we develop a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT acceleration on mobile phones. Compared to prior studies on ViT quantization using 8-bit precision, PackQViT surpasses other works by an improved accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 17.9% for various widely used ViTs on ImageNet dataset; under 4-bit precision, PackQViT demonstrates 0.4% \u21e0 2.8% higher accuracy. Compared to the baseline multiplier, our implementations on the Realme GT Android smartphone with Snapdragon 870 SoC CPU achieve 2 . 6 \u21e5\u21e0 3 . 7 \u21e5 speedup under 8-bit scenario and 3 . 8 \u21e5\u21e0 5 . 9 \u21e5 speedup under 4-bit which ensures practical real-time performance.

FrameQuant: Flexible Low-Bit Quantization for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization transformers hardware efficiency training stability*\n\n*Harshavardhan Adepu, Zhanpeng Zeng, Li Zhang, Vikas Singh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work outlines a simple scheme to quantize Transformer-based models to just two bits (plus some overhead) with only a small drop in accuracy, and shows empirically, via a variety of experiments, that (almost) two-bit quantization for Transformer models promises sizable efficiency gains.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the backbone of powerful foundation models for many Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. But their compute and memory/storage footprint is large, and so, serving such models is expensive often requiring high-end hardware. To mitigate this difficulty, Post-Training Quantization seeks to modify a pre-trained model and quantize it to eight bits or lower, significantly boosting compute/memory/latency efficiency. Such models have been successfully quantized to four bits with some performance loss. In this work, we outline a simple scheme to quantize Transformer-based models to just two bits (plus some overhead) with only a small drop in accuracy. Key to our formulation is a concept borrowed from Harmonic analysis called Fusion Frames. Our main finding is that the quantization must take place not in the original weight space, but instead in the Fusion Frame representations. If quantization is interpreted as the addition of noise, our casting of the problem allows invoking an extensive body of known consistent recovery and noise robustness guarantees. Further, if desired, de-noising filters are known in closed form. We show empirically, via a variety of experiments, that (almost) two-bit quantization for Transformer models promises sizable efficiency gains.

Bag of Tricks for Optimizing Transformer Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization transformers hardware efficiency training stability*\n\n*Ye Lin, Yanyang Li, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies.\n\n**Abstract:** Improving Transformer efficiency has become increasingly attractive recently. A wide range of methods has been proposed, e.g., pruning, quantization, new architectures and etc. But these methods are either sophisticated in implementation or dependent on hardware. In this paper, we show that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies. On the WMT news translation tasks, we improve the inference efficiency of a strong Transformer system by 3.80X on CPU and 2.52X on GPU. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Lollipop321/mini-decoder-network.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, here are some key findings and references that align with the specified keywords and details:\n\n## Vector Quantization Techniques for Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ):** This method uses Second-Order Optimization to formulate the vector quantization problem for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. It compresses vectors into indices using lookup tables, which is particularly useful for reducing memory requirements and optimizing storage costs.\n\n- **Quantization of KV Cache:** The paper on \"QServe\" by MIT, NVIDIA, UMass Amherst, and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab introduces techniques such as 4-bit KV-cache quantization and progressive quantization of weights. This includes methods like SmoothAttention to reduce the error of 4-bit quantization, which is compatible with RoPE operations and can be fused into preceding linear layers.\n\n- **Low-Rank Quantization Error Reconstruction (LQER):** This work focuses on identifying effective practices for quantizing LLMs, balancing performance with computational efficiency. It includes a quantization toolkit (LLMC) and principles for inference efficiency, quantized accuracy, calibration cost, and modularization. The study provides best practices for the LLM post-training quantization (PTQ) pipeline.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Compressed Neural Networks\n\n- **QServe:** This work includes comprehensive studies on deep LLM optimization and system co-design for efficient LLM serving. It provides tips and tricks for designing efficient inference kernels and execution pipelines on NVIDIA GPUs, significantly reducing LLM serving costs.\n\n- **ZipCache:** This method achieves good compression ratios and fast generation speeds by quantizing the KV cache. For example, it compresses the KV cache by 4.98\u00d7 with only a 0.38% drop in accuracy, demonstrating hardware-efficient implementation.\n\n- **Graph Quantized Tokenizers (GQT):** This approach uses Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. This is particularly beneficial for efficient memory usage during Transformer training and inference.\n\n## Training Stability Methods for Quantized Models\n\n- **Progressive Quantization and SmoothAttention:** The \"QServe\" paper introduces progressive quantization of weights and the SmoothAttention method to reduce the error of 4-bit quantization. These techniques help maintain training stability and accuracy during the quantization process.\n\n- **Auxiliary Loss for Load Balancing in MoE:** The Switch Transformer and other MoE models use auxiliary loss (load balancing loss) to ensure equal importance among experts during training. This helps prevent overfitting and maintains training stability by ensuring a uniform distribution of tokens across experts.\n\n- **Quantization-Aware Training:** The \"BitsFusion\" paper proposes a two-stage quantization-aware training approach, which includes distillation at the first stage. This method helps in initializing the quantized model and improving its performance, ensuring training stability.\n\n## Integration of Compression with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Quantization of KV Cache with Attention:** The \"QServe\" and \"ZipCache\" methods specifically focus on quantizing the KV cache, which is a critical component of attention mechanisms in transformers. These methods ensure that the quantization process is compatible with RoPE operations and other attention-related mechanisms, maintaining the accuracy of the model.\n\n- **SmoothAttention:** This method is designed to reduce the error of 4-bit quantization of the Key cache, which is essential for attention mechanisms. It can be fused into preceding linear layers, ensuring that the quantization does not degrade the performance of the attention mechanism.\n\nThese findings and references provide valuable insights into vector quantization techniques, hardware-efficient implementations, training stability methods, and the integration of compression with attention mechanisms, all of which are crucial for improving the design of autoregressive language models.\n",
