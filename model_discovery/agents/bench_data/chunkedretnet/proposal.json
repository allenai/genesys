Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/43 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32: 8026-8037, 2019.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Shengnan Wang, Youhui Bai, Lin Zhang, Pingyi Zhou, Shixiong Zhao, Gong Zhang, Sen Wang, Renhai Chen, Hua Xu, Hongwei Sun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), is proposed, which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization failure problem, namely the large language model (LLM) fails to generalize to texts longer than its maximum training length, greatly restricts the application of LLM in the scenarios with streaming long inputs. To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2017); Brown et al. (2020); Touvron et al. (2023); Scao et al. (2022) have shown their impressive performance in many language tasks Zhao et al. (2023). However, due to the out-of-domain and distraction issues Xiao et al. (2024), the quality of the LLM's generation drops dramatically when the sequence length surpasses its context window size which is the largest training length. Such a drawback hinders the application of LLM in multi-round dialogue, conversation conduction, documents summarization, and other real tasks which often encounter very long sequences. Some pioneering works have been done for context length extrapolation. Most of them focused on optimizing the positional encoding (PE), since the PE of unseen length was identified as a major factor leading to length generalization failure. Compared with the vanilla absolute PE, the later proposed relative PE Raffel et al. (2020); Su et al. (2021), ALiBi Press et al. (2021), and NoPE Kazemnejad et al. (2023) were demonstrated to offer better generalization. However, all of them do not perform well when the sequence length is significantly longer than the largest training length. A more effective approach is to continually train or fine-tune the model on longer-length data Chen et al. (2023); Peng et al. (2023). Nevertheless, such a manner can only extend the context window to a limited length due to unacceptable training costs Xiong et al. (2023). Moreover, when the length is very long, even collecting the training data itself is a difficult task. Recently, some training-free length extension methods attracted widespread attention. LM-Infinite Han et al. (2023) and StreamLLM Xiao et al. (2023) extrapolated the length by discarding most contexts but only keeping the context at the end and the very beginning. Though these methods can efficiently deal with extremely long contexts, they lose a lot of long-distance dependencies, which leads to deviations or even errors in text understanding. PCW Ratner et al. (2023) designed chunked attention mask and reused the positional encoding for different chunks, which alleviated the restriction of the context window.\n```\n\n#### 4. Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling (Avg.

Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an efficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon previous methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size; (2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference speed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which improves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments show the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and for pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the cache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and show improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning tasks.

The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: context length generalization*\n\n*Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Inkit Padhi, K. Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2.

Veness*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work demonstrates that this failure mode is linked to positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences (even for relative encoding) and introduces a novel family of positional encodes that can overcome this problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have impressive generalization capabilities on tasks with a fixed context length. However, they fail to generalize to sequences of arbitrary length, even for seemingly simple tasks such as duplicating a string. Moreover, simply training on longer sequences is inefficient due to the quadratic computation complexity of the global attention mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate that this failure mode is linked to positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences (even for relative encodings) and introduce a novel family of positional encodings that can overcome this problem. Concretely, our randomized positional encoding scheme simulates the positions of longer sequences and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the sequence\u2019s length. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of 6000 models across 15 algorithmic reasoning tasks shows that our method allows Transformers to generalize to sequences of unseen length (increasing test accuracy by 12.0% on average).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

HiRoPE: Length Extrapolation for Code Models Using Hierarchical Position\n\n*From Search Query: position encoding long sequences*\n\n*Kechi Zhang, Ge Li, Huangzhao Zhang, Zhi Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code, and significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.\n\n**Abstract:** Addressing the limitation of context length in large language models for code-related tasks is the primary focus of this paper. Existing LLMs are constrained by their pre-trained context lengths, leading to performance issues in handling long complex code sequences. Inspired by how human programmers navigate code, we introduce Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code. HiRoPE offers easy integration into existing LLMs without extra training costs. Our method is extensively evaluated with various LLMs, demonstrating stable performance in tasks such as language modeling and long code completion. We also introduce a new long code understanding task with real-world code projects, in hopes of promoting further development in this code-related field. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that HiRoPE also addresses the out-of-distribution issue in position encoding. Our HiRoPE significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

I-BERT: Inductive Generalization of Transformer to Arbitrary Context Lengths\n\n*From Search Query: context length generalization*\n\n*Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Hyoungwook Nam, Seung Byum Seo, Noor Michael, Lan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has emerged as a vital component of state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing in recent years, brought to the forefront by pre-trained bi-directional Transformer models. Its effectiveness is partly due to its non-sequential architecture, which promotes scalability and parallelism but limits the model to inputs of a bounded length. In particular, such architectures perform poorly on algorithmic tasks, where the model must learn a procedure which generalizes to input lengths unseen in training, a capability we refer to as inductive generalization. Identifying the computational limits of existing self-attention mechanisms, we propose I-BERT, a bi-directional Transformer that replaces positional encodings with a recurrent layer. The model inductively generalizes on a variety of algorithmic tasks where state-of-the-art Transformer models fail to do so. We also test our method on masked language modeling tasks where training and validation sets are partitioned to verify inductive generalization. Out of three algorithmic and two natural language inductive generalization tasks, I-BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on four tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-18\n\n\n\n#### 2. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

PermuteFormer: Efficient Relative Position Encoding for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: position encoding long sequences*\n\n*Peng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer sequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with relative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position encoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position encoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a Performer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on long sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on queries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module. This transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of self-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer introduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as Performer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long sequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The experiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of Performer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla Transformer on most of the tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 5. RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: position encoding long sequences*\n\n*Ahmed Murtadha, Yunfeng Liu, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Yu Lu, Jianlin Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: \\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer}.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the RetNet architecture, particularly in handling longer sequences, improving context length generalization, and increasing memory efficiency, here are some key points and recommendations based on the provided analysis and additional insights:\n\n### Advanced Positional Encoding\n\n- **Resonance RoPE**: This method refines the interpolation of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) features for out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions, which can significantly improve the model's performance on longer sequences without additional computational costs. Integrating Resonance RoPE into the RetNet GAU could be a promising approach to enhance its long-context capabilities.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **LM-Infinite**: This method allows large language models to generalize to extremely long contexts (up to 200M length inputs) while retaining perplexity. Adapting the techniques from LM-Infinite, such as dynamic context window adjustments and efficient attention mechanisms, could be beneficial for RetNet to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n\n### Parallel Context Encoding\n\n- **Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE)**: This framework uses a small encoder to process long inputs in chunks, enabling the decoder to utilize additional context via cross-attention. Incorporating a similar parallel context encoding component into the RetNet GAU could enhance its ability to handle longer sequences by efficiently summarizing previous tokens.\n\n### Retention Mechanism Enhancements\n\n- **RetNet's GAU**: The Generalized Attention Unit (GAU) in RetNet is crucial for sequence modeling. Refining this mechanism to better capture long-range dependencies, possibly by incorporating data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) mechanisms similar to those in Rodimus+, could improve performance on long-context tasks.\n\n### State Space Models\n\n- Although RetNet is distinct from state space models, recent advancements in state-space models, such as those using HiPPO, have shown notable results in long sequence modeling. Exploring these techniques could provide additional insights into efficient handling of long sequences and might be adaptable to the RetNet architecture.\n\n### Key Recommendations\n\n1. **Integrate Resonance RoPE**:\n   - Adapt Resonance RoPE within the RetNet GAU to improve positional encoding for longer sequences. This could involve refining the interpolation of RoPE features to handle OOD token positions efficiently.\n\n2. **Implement Memory-Efficient Attention**:\n   - Draw from LM-Infinite's methods to implement dynamic context window adjustments and efficient attention mechanisms within RetNet. This could help in reducing computational complexity and memory usage.\n\n3. **Incorporate Parallel Context Encoding**:\n   - Assess the feasibility of integrating a parallel context encoding component, similar to CEPE, into the RetNet GAU. This could enable the model to handle longer sequences by efficiently processing and summarizing previous tokens.\n\n4. **Enhance Retention Mechanism**:\n   - Refine the GAU in RetNet to better capture long-range dependencies. This might involve incorporating data-dependent mechanisms or other advanced gating techniques to improve the model's ability to handle long contexts.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can significantly enhance the RetNet architecture to better handle longer sequences, improve context length generalization, and achieve greater memory efficiency.\n",

Besides algorithms manipulating explicit position features, the success of Transformers without position encodings (NoPE) provides a new way to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE's generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads' best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE's context size. Experiments on long sequence language modeling, the synthetic passkey retrieval task and real-world long context tasks show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art length generalization algorithms.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/19 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2023); Anil et al. (2022). Chen et al. (2023) showed that using position interpolation (PI) rather than extrapolation during fine-tuning can extend the context window of the pre-trained LLMs to 32k without performance loss. Further, Yarn Peng et al. (2023) proposed a novel NTK-aware interpolation method and achieved tens of times extension of the context window size. Other fine-tuning based methods include Giraffe Pal et al. (2023), FoT Tworkowski et al. (2023), and so on. However, this kind of method requires massive training resources since it needs to train LLMs on long-sequence data. In addition, collecting enough long-sequence data itself for fine-tuning is also a challenging work if one wants to extend the context window to extremely long. ### 2.2 Extension without fine-tuning\n\nTo save resources, some training-free context window extension methods are proposed. At the very beginning, most researchers focused on optimizing the positional encoding. The vanilla absolute position encoding strictly restricts the reasoning length of LLM. To tackle this issue, a lot of advanced position encoding schemes were proposed, such as RoPE Su et al. (2021), ALiBi Press et al. (2021), and the recently proposed NoPE Kazemnejad et al. (2023). However, all of them only make the model architecturally-able to deal with long inputs rather than actually perform well on long-sequence reasoning tasks Li et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/43 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32: 8026-8037, 2019.

Previous efforts for adapting LLMs to a longer length usually requires fine-tuning with this target length (Full-length fine-tuning), suffering intensive training cost. To decouple train length from target length for efficient context window extension, we propose Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training that smartly simulates long inputs using a fixed context window. This is achieved by first dividing the original context window into several chunks, then designing distinct skipping bias terms to manipulate the position indices of each chunk. These bias terms and the lengths of each chunk are altered for every training example, allowing the model to adapt to all positions within target length. Experimental results show that PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead compared with Full-length fine-tuning, with minimal impact on performance. Leveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMA model to 128k tokens using a 2k training context window. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that PoSE is compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and position interpolation strategies. Notably, our method can potentially support infinite length, limited only by memory usage in inference. With ongoing progress for efficient inference, we believe PoSE can further scale the context window beyond 128k.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/23 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 3214-3252, 2022.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Integration of Advanced Positional Encodings**:\n\n  - *Resonance RoPE* can be integrated into the RetNet GAU to improve handling of longer sequences. Since RetNet uses positional embeddings, adapting Resonance RoPE might enhance its ability to generalize to longer contexts without changing the model's architecture significantly.\n\n  - *CAPE* and *FIRE* offer methods for context-adaptive and functional interpolation of positional encodings, which could also be beneficial when incorporated into RetNet.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n\n  - *LM-Infinite* demonstrates techniques to extend context length generalization significantly. It adjusts the attention mechanism to handle long sequences more efficiently, which might be adaptable to RetNet's retention mechanism.\n\n  - *CEPE* introduces a parallel encoding framework, where a lightweight encoder processes long contexts in chunks. Integrating a similar approach into RetNet could allow it to handle longer sequences by summarizing previous tokens efficiently.\n\n- **Enhancing Retention Mechanism**:\n\n  - As RetNet relies on its retention mechanism for sequence modeling, refining this component to better capture long-range dependencies is crucial. Techniques from state space models or memory-efficient attention could be applied.\n\n- **Challenges and Considerations**:\n\n  - **Compatibility**: Ensuring that any new positional encoding or attention mechanism is compatible with RetNet's architecture is essential. Modifications should not disrupt the existing flow of data through the GAUs.\n\n  - **Computational Overhead**: While enhancing the model's capacity to handle longer sequences, it's important to avoid significant increases in computational cost or memory usage.\n\n- **Potential Approach**:\n\n  - *Modify the RetNet GAU to incorporate Resonance RoPE*, replacing or augmenting its current positional encoding mechanism.\n\n  - *Implement memory-efficient attention within the MultiScaleRetention unit*, possibly inspired by LM-Infinite or other efficient attention methods, to reduce complexity when processing long sequences.\n\n#### 4. Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into Implementation**:\n\n  - Search for implementation details and practical considerations when integrating Resonance RoPE into existing architectures.\n\n  - Investigate any existing adaptations of memory-efficient attention mechanisms within RetNet-like models.\n\n- **Explore Additional Models**:\n\n  - Look into other successful models handling long contexts, such as *Neurocache* or *HiRoPE*, for ideas that could be adapted to RetNet.\n\n- **Evaluate Potential Challenges**:\n\n  - Research potential pitfalls or challenges faced when integrating advanced positional encodings or efficient attention mechanisms into transformer-like architectures.\n\n- **Plan Next Steps**:\n\n  - Formulate a preliminary modification plan for the RetNet GAU based on the insights gained.\n\n  - Prepare to conduct further searches focusing on practical implementation strategies and empirical results from similar modifications.\n\n#### 5.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/43 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n4. More recently, Zhou et al. (2024) show that standard Transformers can generalize to a sequence length that is $2.5 \\times$ the training input length on integer addition using FIRE (and other techniques (Ruoss et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023)). Positional encoding in Transformers. Positional encoding is a critical component of Transformers. Vaswani et al. (2017) propose sinusoidal Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) to encode positional information in the sequential input. Shaw et al. (2018) are the first to propose Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) for Transformers, and many follow-up works explore different RPE strategies (Dai et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019). There are also many works that study positional encoding from different perspectives, including the disentanglement of positional and content information (Kitaev \\& Klein, 2018; Ke et al., 2021), the representational power of attention modules and Transformers (Cordonnier et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022), computational efficiency (Su et al., 2021; Liutkus et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2023), and length generalization (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). Our work is based on a unified formulation of existing additive relative positional encoding approaches, and proposes new RPE variant aimed at improving length generalization. Interpolation techniques in deep learning. Interpolation techniques are successfully applied to many deep learning applications, especially in computer vision. Long et al. (2015) employ bilinear interpolation in up-sampling layers of convolutional neural networks for dense visual prediction. Dong et al. (2015); Johnson et al. (2016) employ bicubic interpolation for image super-resolution. Radford et al. (2015) probe generative models by interpolation in the latent space. Zhang et al. (2018); Han et al. (2022) use interpolating between pairs of examples and their labels as an data augmentation method. Recently, Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) propose to perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained APE for Vision Transformer to apply the model to higher resolution images. In contrast, our interpretation is applied in the relative position encoding functions. Besides, we are focused on causal attention setting where \"global\" information such as the total sequence length is unknown, while Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) work on encoder-only Transformers with fixed input lengths. ## E IMPLEMENTATION\n\nIn this section, we present the implementation of our proposed FIRE module in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019). ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nclass FIRE(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_heads=12, mlp_width=32, init_c=0.1,\n        init_L=512., eps=1e-6):\n    \" \" \"\n    FIRE attention bias module.

GLUE and SuperGLUE are widely-used benchmarks to evaluation the natrual language understanding capability of neural language models (Wang et al., 2019b;a). We finetune the models on a mixture of the tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE for simplicity. We evaluate the model on each task separately. We use the macro average accuracy/exact match across all the tasks as our main evaluation metric. Table 12 presents our finetuning configurations. Detailed results. For reference, we present detailed results for all the models on each individual dataset in Table 13. In general, FIRE achieves decent performances. Thus, FIRE's strong performances on long sequences does not come at the price of sacrificing model quality on short sequences and standard tasks.

We notice that FIRE models learn both local and anti-local position patterns. ## C. 6 EFFICIENCY AND FIRE-SHARED\n\nFor FIRE-S (FIRE with layerwise sharing), we experiment with the base-sized model ( 125 M parameters), and keep all the configurations and training recipes the same as those in previous subsections. The models are pretrained on C4 with sequence length 2048. The finetuning sequence lengths are 8192/1024 for SCROLLS and GLUE/SuperGLUE, respectively. For the inference time evaluation, we test the forward time of base-sized model with different positional encodings on sequence length 2048. We measure the forward time on 4 TPUv2 chips for all the models, and report the average result over 10 runs. ## D RELated WORKS\n\nIn the main body of the paper, we cover the most relevant works to our paper (Sec. 2). In this section, we provide more discussions on related works. Length generalization. Many existing works show the length generalization failure of standard Transformer models (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Deletang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). Recently, there have been growing interests in long-context applications such as multi-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Dziri et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) and document/book understanding (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2018; Ke et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022; Ainslie et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Designing lengthgeneralizable Transformers is appealing for these applications. Dubois et al. (2020); Chowdhury \\& Caragea (2023) introduce location attention for length generalization on synthetic tasks. Bueno et al. (2022) show that generating step-by-step rationales and using marker tokens as positional guides helps length generalization. Studying positional encoding approaches for length generalization is a main direction in this line of research. Press et al. (2022); Chi et al. (2022; 2023) propose new relative positional encoding methods which emphasize recency bias and improve language modeling on longer sequences. Chu et al. (2023) propose Conditional Positional Encodings to enhance Vision Transformer length generalization. The most relevant to our work is a concurrent paper by Chen et al. (2023). It propose Position Interpolation (PI) for Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), which extends the context window of RoPE-based pretrained models given a downstream max sequence length. However, this requires additional finetuning on longer sequence data, albeit for much fewer steps than original training. By contrast, our proposed FIRE does not require a pre-defined max sequence length, and can be directly applied to length generalization setting without tuning. We provide extensive experimental comparisons in Sec.\n```\n\n#### 2. Retentive network: a successor to transformer for large language models (Avg.

However, training parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the $O(N)$ complexity per step and memory-bound key-value cache [Sha19], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment. The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient $O(1)$ inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously, i.e., the so-called \"impossible triangle\" as shown in Figure 2. There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [KVPF20] approximates standard attention scores $\\exp (\\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k})$ with kernels $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, so that autoregressive inference can be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than Transformers, which hinders the method's popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators $\\left[\\mathrm{PAA}^{+} 23\\right]$ are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third line of research explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S 4 [GGR21], and its variants [DFS ${ }^{+}$22, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23]. None of the previous work can break through the impossible triangle, resulting in no clear winner compared with Transformers. In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient longsequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention, which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient $O(1)$ inference in terms of memory and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory. We conduct extensive experiments to compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning. Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8 k sequence length, RetNet decodes $8.4 \\times$ faster and saves $70 \\%$ of memory than Transformers with key-value caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 25-50\\% memory saving and $7 \\times$ acceleration than standard Transformer and an advantage towards highly-optimized FlashAttention $\\left[\\mathrm{DFE}^{+}\\right.$22]. Besides, RetNet's inference latency is insensitive to batch size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. ## 2 Retentive Networks\n\nRetentive network (RetNet) is stacked with $L$ identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e., residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17]. Each RetNet block contains two modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence $x=x_{1} \\cdots x_{|x|}$, RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{|x|}$ is first packed into $X^{0}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{|x|}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, where $d_{\\text {model }}$ is hidden dimension. Then we compute contextualized vector representations $X^{l}=\\operatorname{RetNet}_{l}\\left(X^{l-1}\\right), l \\in[1, L]$. ### 2.1 Retention\n\nIn this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference. Given input $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, we project it to one-dimensional function $v(n)=X_{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_{V}$. Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ through states $s_{n}$. Let $v_{n}, o_{n}$ denote $v(n), o(n)$ for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\ns_{n}=A s_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} v_{n}, & A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, K_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\no_{n}=Q_{n} s_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n} A^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m}, & Q_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we map $v_{n}$ to the state vector $s_{n}$, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence information recurrently. Next, we make the projection $Q_{n}, K_{n}$ content-aware:\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{Q}, W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable matrices. We diagonalize the matrix $A=\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\Lambda^{-1}$, where $\\gamma, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then we obtain $A^{n-m}=$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} \\Lambda^{-1}$. By absorbing $\\Lambda$ into $W_{Q}$ and $W_{K}$, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\no_{n} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)\\left(K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}\\right)^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} v_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}, K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}$ is known as xPos [SDP ${ }^{+}$22], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed for Transformer. We further simplify $\\gamma$ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n$$\no_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\gamma^{n-m}\\left(Q_{n} e^{i n \\theta}\\right)\\left(K_{m} e^{i m \\theta}\\right)^{\\dagger} v_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere ${ }^{\\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances. In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ as vectors and obtain the retention mechanism as follows. The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3a, the retention layer is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nQ=\\left(X W_{Q}\\right) \\odot \\Theta, \\quad K=\\left(X W_{K}\\right) \\odot \\bar{\\Theta}, \\quad V=X W_{V} \\\\\n\\Theta_{n}=e^{i n \\theta}, \\quad D_{n m}= \\begin{cases}\\gamma^{n-m}, & n \\geq m \\\\\n0, & n<m\\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Retention}(X)=\\left(Q K^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} \\odot D\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\Theta}$ is the complex conjugate of $\\Theta$, and $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times|x|}$ combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one matrix. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models with GPUs efficiently. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fb33982bc7545f33a227g-04.jpg?height=520&width=1245&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=526)\n\nFigure 3: Dual form of RetNet. \"GN\" is short for GroupNorm. The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3b, the proposed mechanism can also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the $n$-th timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{n}=\\gamma S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} V_{n} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{n}\\right)=Q_{n} S_{n}, \\quad n=1, \\cdots,|x|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V, \\gamma$ are the same as in Equation (5). The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention A hybrid form of parallel representation and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation (Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let $B$ denote the chunk length. We compute the retention output of the $i$-th chunk via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{[i]}=Q_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad K_{[i]}=K_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad V_{[i]}=V_{B i: B(i+1)} \\\\\n& R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\\top}\\left(V_{[i]} \\odot \\zeta\\right)+\\gamma^{B} R_{i-1}, \\quad \\zeta_{i j}=\\gamma^{B-i-1} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{[i]}\\right)= \\underbrace{\\left.Q_{[i]} K_{[i]}^{\\top} \\odot D\\right) V_{[i]}}_{\\text {Inner-Chunk }}+\\underbrace{\\left(Q_{[i]} R_{i-1}\\right) \\odot \\xi}_{\\text {Cross-Chunk }}, \\quad \\xi_{i j}=\\gamma^{i+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $[i]$ indicates the $i$-th chunk, i.e., $x_{[i]}=\\left[x_{(i-1) B+1}, \\cdots, x_{i B}\\right]$. ### 2.2 Gated Multi-Scale Retention\n\nWe use $h=d_{\\text {model }} / d$ retention heads in each layer, where $d$ is the head dimension. The heads use different parameter matrices $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns different $\\gamma$ for each head. For simplicity, we set $\\gamma$ identical among different layers and keep them fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [HG16, RZL17] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers. Formally, given input $X$, we define the layer as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma=1-2^{-5-\\operatorname{arange}(0, h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{head}_{i}=\\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X, \\gamma_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& Y=\\operatorname{GroupNorm}_{h}\\left(\\operatorname{Concat}\\left(\\operatorname{head}_{1}, \\cdots, \\text { head }_{h}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MSR}(X)=\\left(\\operatorname{swish}\\left(X W_{G}\\right) \\odot Y\\right) W_{O}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{G}, W_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [WH18] normalizes the output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [SPP ${ }^{+}$19].\n```\n\n#### 3.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/74 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4 layer to a special case where the state dimension is $N=1$. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be viewed as a special case of a linear SSM. Its primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large head dimension, which can be viewed as another method to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context of linear attention variants was first done by H 3 , but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation. RetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case of SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\n```\n\n#### 4.

All code and data used in this work are released at https: //github.com/HKUNLP/ChunkLlama. ## 1. Introduction\n\nThe ability to comprehend and process long-context information is essential for large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Bai et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2023) to cater to a wide range of applications effectively. These include analyzing and responding to inquiries within sizable PDFs, retaining extended dialogue history, and empowering interactive chatbots (Wei et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Rula \\& D\u2019Souza, 2023; Saad-Falcon et al., 2023; Lv et al., 2024). [^0]Recent advances have shown that the long-context ability can be improved by further training a short-context model on long text sequences (Ruoss et al., 2023; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023). The impressive performance of Llama2 Long (Xiong et al., 2023), which is trained from a mix of long text data and the original Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) pre-training corpus, stands as a testament to this approach. Nevertheless, due to the limited accessibility of these training corpora and the prohibitive cost of long-context finetuning, current open-source models often fall short in performance when compared to the proprietary counterparts, and are generally available in smaller sizes (e.g., 7B/13B). Given these constraints, approaches that do not require additional training for context scaling in LLMs become particularly attractive. Recent training-free methods, including LMinfinite (Han et al., 2023) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023), have shown that LLMs trained on a limited context window can efficiently process text of infinite length (Zhang et al., 2023; 2024; Xiao et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024). Assuming that LLMs are unable to generalize to texts longer than the training length, these models handle extended sequences by selectively retaining essential local information. Such paradigms effectively maintain a low Perplexity (PPL), yet they lose long-range dependencies. To retain the global information, another perspective is to effectively extrapolate to sequence lengths that surpass those encountered during their training (Sun et al., 2022; Kazemnejad et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Chi et al., 2023). Popular techniques for Llama-based models, including Position Interpolation (PI) (Chen et al., 2023b) and NTK-Aware RoPE (NTK) (LocalLLaMA, 2023b;a), are adaptations of Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2022). These scaled positional encodings necessitate fewer finetuning steps compared to the original RoPE, and their training costs can be further reduced via methods such as YaRN (Peng et al., 2023) and CLEX (Chen et al., 2023a). However, in a training-free setting, we find that these approaches usually lead to a notable increase in PPL especially in input lengths that are more than twice the training length ( $\\S 4$, Table 1). In this paper, we introduce Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), a new training-free framework to extrapolate the context window of LLMs. We avoid linearly downscaling the position indices or increasing the base frequency in RoPE ( Su et al., 2022). Instead, we opt to reuse the original position\nindices with their embeddings from the pretrained model, yet to redesign the construction of the relative position matrix in such a way that it can accurately reflect the relative position of two tokens as faithfully as possible. Inspired by efficient chunk-based attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Song et al., 2023; Ratner et al., 2023; He et al., 2024), DCA segments self-attention computations for a long sequence into small chunks, each chunk being smaller than the size of the pretraining window. DCA consists of three components: (1) intra-chunk attention, tailored for processing tokens within the same chunk; (2) inter-chunk attention, for processing tokens between distinct chunks; and (3) successive chunk attention, for processing tokens in successive, distinct chunks. These respective treatments help the model effectively capture both long-range and short-range dependencies in a sequence. In addition to that, the chunk-based attention calculation can be seamlessly integrated with Flash Attention 2 (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), a key element for long-context scaling in the open-source community. ${ }^{1}$\n\nWe present a comprehensive evaluation of our models on a diverse range of tasks that include language modeling, passkey retrieval, and real-world long-context applications that span question answering (Pang et al., 2022; Ko\u010disk\u00fd et al., 2018; Dasigi et al., 2021; An et al., 2023) and summarization (Zhong et al., 2021). Unlike previous work that is usually limited to verification on $7 \\mathrm{~B} / 13 \\mathrm{~B}$ models, the significant training efficiency of our method makes it possible to validate on 70B models, ensuring robust conclusions. To verify the model's long-context ability independent of potential data exposure during pretraining, we used this paper itself as the input and crafted a series of questions for the models. ${ }^{2}$ Our empirical results reveal the following insights:\n\n1. Extrapolation. On language modeling, DCA marks a significant advance for training-free approaches. It first shows that LLMs with a 4 k context window can be expanded to more than 32 k without training, maintaining a negligible increase in PPL, whereas previous methods typically falter at context lengths beyond 8 k . Furthermore, we demonstrate that Llama2 70B, when integrated with DCA, showcases an exceptional extrapolation capability to handle context sizes exceeding 100k tokens. 2. Orthogonality. DCA is orthogonal to existing popular scaled positional encodings such as PI (Chen et al., 2023b) and NTK (LocalLLaMA, 2023b;a). We empirically show that existing long-context LLMs, which have already supported a 32 k context window, can further extrapolate to a 192 k context length while maintaining high passkey retrieval accuracy and low perplexity.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Dual Chunk Attention RetNet, FIRE positional encoding RetNet, chunk-based attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

To alleviate the complexity of long-sequence processing, we propose a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths. More specifically, our method divides each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then aligns the interchunk information during the encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards the decoders of transformers as environments, and the downstream performance metrics as the rewards to evaluate the hidden selection actions. Our empirical results on real-world long-text summarization and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate effective improvements compared to prior longsequence processing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model.

Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: chunk-based attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: chunk-based attention mechanisms*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget. The code and models are publicly available at: www.github.com/gokulsg/HBERT/.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Improving language models by retrieving from trillions of tokens\n\n*From Search Query: chunk-based attention mechanisms*\n\n*Laurent SIfre, Erich Elsen, Jack W. Rae, Karen Simonyan, Simon Osindero, Oriol Vinyals, Geoffrey Irving, Michela Paganini, Andy Brock, Albin Cassirer, Chris Jones, Loren Maggiore, Saffron Huang, Tom Hennigan, Roman Ring, Jacob Menick, Aurelia Guy, Diego de Las Casas, Aidan Clark, Bogdan Damoc, Jean-Baptiste Lespiau, George van den Driessche, Katie Millican, Eliza Rutherford, Trevor Cai, Jordan Hoffmann, Arthur Mensch, Sebastian Borgeaud*\n\n**Abstract:** We enhance auto-regressive language models by conditioning on document chunks retrieved from a large corpus, based on local similarity with preceding tokens. With a $2$ trillion token database, our Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) obtains comparable performance to GPT-3 and Jurassic-1 on the Pile, despite using 25$\\times$ fewer parameters. After fine-tuning, RETRO performance translates to downstream knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. RETRO combines a frozen Bert retriever, a differentiable encoder and a chunked cross-attention mechanism to predict tokens based on an order of magnitude more data than what is typically consumed during training. We typically train RETRO from scratch, yet can also rapidly RETROfit pre-trained transformers with retrieval and still achieve good performance. Our work opens up new avenues for improving language models through explicit memory at unprecedented scale.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. MossFormer: Pushing the Performance Limit of Monaural Speech Separation using Gated Single-Head Transformer with Convolution-Augmented Joint Self-Attentions\n\n*From Search Query: chunk-based attention mechanisms*\n\n*Bin Ma, Shengkui Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer based models have provided significant performance improvements in monaural speech separation. However, there is still a performance gap compared to a recent proposed upper bound. The major limitation of the current dual-path Transformer models is the inefficient modelling of long-range elemental interactions and local feature patterns. In this work, we achieve the upper bound by proposing a gated single-head transformer architecture with convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, named \\textit{MossFormer} (\\textit{Mo}naural \\textit{s}peech \\textit{s}eparation Trans\\textit{Former}). To effectively solve the indirect elemental interactions across chunks in the dual-path architecture, MossFormer employs a joint local and global self-attention architecture that simultaneously performs a full-computation self-attention on local chunks and a linearised low-cost self-attention over the full sequence. The joint attention enables MossFormer model full-sequence elemental interaction directly. In addition, we employ a powerful attentive gating mechanism with simplified single-head self-attentions. Besides the attentive long-range modelling, we also augment MossFormer with convolutions for the position-wise local pattern modelling. As a consequence, MossFormer significantly outperforms the previous models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on WSJ0-2/3mix and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks. Our model achieves the SI-SDRi upper bound of 21.2 dB on WSJ0-3mix and only 0.3 dB below the upper bound of 23.1 dB on WSJ0-2mix.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the RetNet architecture, particularly the RetNet GAU, and achieve the goals of improving context length generalization, increasing memory efficiency, and maintaining or enhancing performance, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Key Approaches for Context Length Generalization\n\n1. **Dual Chunk Attention (DCA)**\n   - DCA, as mentioned in the analysis, is a promising approach that divides sequences into chunks and processes intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention separately. This method allows models to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without additional training, which aligns well with the goal of extending context length efficiently[Analysis Note **b**].\n\n2. **XL3M: Segment-wise Inference**\n   - XL3M decomposes the input context into short sub-contexts with a common \"question\" for inference, constructing a concise key context to process long sequences efficiently. This training-free framework can be adapted to enhance RetNet's ability to handle long sequences[Analysis Note **c**].\n\n3. **Positional Skip-wise Training (PoSE)**\n   - PoSE simulates long inputs using a fixed context window, enabling models to extend context length without full-length fine-tuning. This approach can be explored to enhance RetNet's positional encoding and length generalization capabilities[Analysis Note **e**].\n\n### Advanced Positional Encoding Schemes\n\n1. **FIRE: Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions**\n   - FIRE improves Transformer generalization to longer contexts by using a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation. This method can be integrated into RetNet to enhance its positional encoding and support longer sequences[Analysis Note **d**].\n\n### Efficiency and Memory Management\n\n1. **Selective Attention Layers (SALs)**\n   - The concept of SALs from the Taipan model, which dynamically allocates computational resources based on token importance, can be insightful. SALs use a lightweight gating network to determine which tokens should undergo softmax attention processing, which could help in reducing computational complexity and memory usage in RetNet.\n\n2. **SeerAttention: Intrinsic Sparse Attention**\n   - SeerAttention learns and leverages intrinsic sparsity in attention to enhance efficiency for long-context tasks. It uses average pooling on Q and a combination of max and min pooling on K, along with a separate RoPE within the AttnGate, which can be adapted to improve RetNet's efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Implementation and Integration Considerations\n\n1. **Chunk-Based Attention Mechanisms**\n   - Adapting chunk-based attention mechanisms like DCA into RetNet's architecture can be feasible by integrating intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention processes. This requires careful consideration of how these mechanisms can be aligned with RetNet's existing structure without disrupting its flow[Analysis Note **3**].\n\n2. **Memory Management**\n   - Effective memory management is crucial when implementing chunk-based methods. Ensuring that RetNet's architecture can accommodate these changes without significant memory overhead is essential. The use of sparse attention mechanisms, as seen in SeerAttention, can also help in managing memory efficiently.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further support the researcher's goals, the following search plan is recommended:\n\n- **Detailed Implementation of DCA and XL3M**: Search for specific implementation details, case studies, or experiments where DCA and XL3M have been integrated into similar architectures. This will help in understanding the practical challenges and benefits of these approaches.\n- **Advanced Positional Encodings**: Deep dive into the implementation of FIRE and other advanced positional encoding schemes. Evaluate their compatibility with RetNet's existing positional encoding and assess how they can enhance length generalization.\n- **Efficiency and Memory Optimization**: Explore more on selective attention layers and sparse attention mechanisms to optimize RetNet's efficiency and memory usage.\n- **Integration Strategies**: Look for studies or experiments that discuss the integration of such mechanisms into existing architectures, highlighting potential pitfalls and mitigation strategies.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to formulate a robust proposal for enhancing the RetNet GAU, ensuring it meets the objectives of improved context length generalization, increased memory efficiency, and maintained or enhanced performance.\n",

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n**Integrating Chunk-Based Attention Mechanisms**\n\n- **Feasibility of Adapting DCA to RetNet**:\n  - RetNet already supports a chunkwise recurrent representation in its retention mechanism.\n  - **Opportunity**: Enhance RetNet's chunkwise processing by integrating DCA's intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention strategies.\n  - **Implementation Considerations**:\n    - **Intra-Chunk Attention**: Within each chunk, use RetNet's existing parallel retention mechanism.\n    - **Inter-Chunk Attention**: Introduce an additional mechanism to handle attention between chunks, possibly leveraging DCA's approach.\n    - **Attention Bias for Relative Positions**: Adjust the attention computation to incorporate relative positional information accurately across chunks.\n\n- **Potential Benefits**:\n  - **Extended Context Length**: Ability to process sequences significantly longer than those seen during training.\n  - **Memory Efficiency**: By processing chunks independently and summarizing cross-chunk information efficiently, memory usage can be optimized.\n\n- **Challenges**:\n  - **Compatibility with RetNet Architecture**: Ensuring that modifications do not disrupt RetNet's training parallelism and inference efficiency.\n  - **Complexity of Inter-Chunk Attention**: Managing the added computational overhead of inter-chunk attention.\n\n**Incorporating Advanced Positional Encodings**\n\n- **Applying FIRE to RetNet**:\n  - FIRE enhances relative positional encodings through progressive interpolation, enabling better generalization to longer contexts.\n  - **Integration Strategy**:\n    - Replace or augment RetNet's existing positional encoding with FIRE's functional relative position encoding.\n    - Leverage the provided PyTorch implementation to adapt FIRE within the RetNet GAU.\n\n- **Potential Benefits**:\n  - **Improved Length Generalization**: Enhanced ability to handle longer sequences without degradation in performance.\n  - **Theoretical Compatibility**: FIRE is shown to represent popular relative positional encodings, which may align with RetNet's mechanisms.\n\n- **Challenges**:\n  - **Implementation Complexity**: Adapting the FIRE module to fit within RetNet's architecture requires careful engineering.\n  - **Parameter Tuning**: Selecting appropriate initialization parameters (`init_c`, `init_L`, etc.) for optimal performance.\n\n**Enhancing RetNet's Retention Mechanism**\n\n- **Informed by Mamba and Related Models**:\n  - Understanding how RetNet simplifies the inner SSM layer (state-space model) to a special case where the state dimension is 1.\n  - **Opportunity**: Reintroduce more expressive state dimensions or selective state expansion to improve modeling capacity.\n\n- **Efficiency Considerations**:\n  - **Computational Overhead**: Any modifications must not significantly increase computational complexity.\n  - **Memory Usage**: Aim to maintain or reduce memory footprint despite added capabilities.\n\n#### 4.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2307.14995, 2023b.

Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Z. Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** EM-LLM is introduced, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency and providing a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/36 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nNeurocomputing, 568:127063, 2024.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/29 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2004.05150, 2020.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

(Hard) ChunkLlama270B The authors introduce successive-chunk attention to address the issue of losing locality in the attention mechanism when using inter-chunk attention. Inter-chunk attention can lead to a situation where the relative position between two tokens in different chunks is not accurately captured, resulting in a high perplexity. Successive-chunk attention helps to maintain locality by adjusting the position indices of the first $w$ tokens in each chunk to ensure that the relative position between neighboring tokens is accurately captured. This allows the model to better handle long-context tasks that require the ability to capture long-range dependencies.

DCA divides sequences into chunks and processes intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention separately, allowing models to handle longer contexts without additional training. This approach can be integrated into RetNet's existing chunkwise recurrent representation[3|.\n  - **Feasibility:** Since RetNet already supports chunkwise processing, adapting DCA's strategies for intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention can enhance RetNet's ability to handle long sequences.\n  - **Implementation Considerations:** Ensure compatibility with RetNet's architecture, manage the added computational overhead of inter-chunk attention, and adjust attention bias for relative positions.\n\n**Incorporating Advanced Positional Encodings:**\n- **Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE):** This method enhances relative positional encodings through progressive interpolation, improving generalization to longer contexts. FIRE can be integrated into RetNet to replace or augment its existing positional encoding[5|.\n  - **Theoretical Compatibility:** FIRE can represent popular relative positional encodings, making it a compatible choice for RetNet.\n  - **Implementation Complexity:** Careful engineering is required to adapt the FIRE module within RetNet's architecture, and parameter tuning (e.g., `init_c`, `init_L`) is necessary.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n\n**Chunk-Based Processing:**\n- Both DCA and the chunk-based method proposed by Xie et al. divide long sequences into manageable chunks, which helps in optimizing memory usage. This approach ensures that each chunk is processed independently, reducing the overall memory footprint[4|.\n  - **Efficiency Benefits:** By summarizing cross-chunk information efficiently, memory usage can be significantly optimized.\n\n### Performance Maintenance\n\n**Retention Mechanism Optimization:**\n- Understanding RetNet's retention mechanism and its simplification to a special case where the state dimension is 1 can help in reintroducing more expressive state dimensions or selective state expansion. This can be informed by models like Mamba, which use linear-time sequence modeling with selective state spaces[5|.\n  - **Efficiency Considerations:** Any modifications must ensure that computational complexity and memory usage are not significantly increased.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Integration of DCA:**\n   - Leverage DCA's intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention strategies to enhance RetNet's chunkwise recurrent representation. This can extend the context length generalization capabilities of RetNet.\n   - Ensure that the integration does not disrupt RetNet's training parallelism and inference efficiency.\n\n2. **Incorporation of FIRE:**\n   - Integrate FIRE's functional relative position encoding into RetNet to improve length generalization. This involves replacing or augmenting the existing positional encoding with FIRE.\n   - Pay attention to parameter tuning and implementation complexity to ensure seamless integration.\n\n3. **Optimization of RetNet's Retention Mechanism:**\n   - Explore reintroducing more expressive state dimensions or selective state expansion, as seen in models like Mamba, to enhance modeling capacity without increasing computational complexity.\n   - Ensure that any modifications maintain or reduce the memory footprint.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Draft a Modification Plan:** Outline the specific architectural changes needed to integrate DCA and FIRE into the RetNet GAU.\n- **Prototype Implementation:** Develop a prototype of the modified RetNet GAU and conduct benchmark testing to evaluate its performance on long-sequence language modeling tasks.\n- **Deep Dive into RetNet's Retention Mechanism:** Gain a deeper understanding of how the retention mechanism can be optimized or extended.\n- **Explore Additional Advanced Positional Encodings:** Consider other methods like CAPE or PoSE for potential integration.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, the researcher can effectively enhance the RetNet architecture to achieve better context length generalization, memory efficiency, and performance maintenance.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

The benefits of linear attention largely depend on its decay mechanism [1-3], which prevents attention dilution [4] and facilitates global interaction among tokens. However, the decay mechanism presents two primary issues: First, the decay mechanism is not easily applicable to high-dimensional inputs due to the need for multiple sequential scans to establish a global multi-dimensional receptive field, which reduces computational efficiency [5, 6]. Additionally, without the decay mechanism, linear attention lacks positional awareness during computations, leading to decreased performance [4]. In light of these challenges, we are investigating the feasibility of reducing sequential scans for multi-dimensional scenarios while preserving performance. We first analyze the types of linear recurrence and divide them into two categories: multiplicative and additive. In multiplicative recurrence, the decay rate is dependent only on the current moment, making it impossible to obtain information about subsequent moments with a single scan. By taking image processing as an example, using multiplicative recurrence will require at least two scans to retrieve the global information [5, 6]. Conversely, in additive recurrence, the decay rate depends on\n\n[^0]all moments through the summation of the importance score of each moment, enabling it to gather global information in a single scan. It is important to note that in non-causal situations, additive recurrence is permutation-invariant, which means it lacks local precedence and therefore diminishes the capture of positional information. To overcome this limitation, we put forth a new approach to positional encoding called Multi-Dimensional Toeplitz Positional Encoding (MD-TPE). This method utilizes the mathematical properties of the Toeplitz matrix to embed relative positional information with linear time complexity, thus ensuring efficiency in multi-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, we expand the Linearized Relative Positional Encoding (LRPE) [7] to high-dimensional scenarios, resulting in the creation of Multi-Dimensional Linearized Relative Positional Encoding (MD-LRPE). We then present LightNet, a new multi-dimensional linear attention model built on additive recurrence. LightNet features a pioneering decay mechanism, allowing for efficient single-scan processing of high-dimensional sequential data. Furthermore, it integrates highly effective multi-dimensional position encoding such as MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to precisely capture positional information. We conduct several evaluations of the performance of our proposed LightNet on a range of tasks, including image generation, image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling. LightNet performs comparably or better than its competitors across all tasks. We summarize our main contributions as follows:\n\n- We analyze the types of linear recurrence, dividing them into two types: multiplicative and additive, where the additive type can obtain global information in a single scan. - We propose two multi-dimensional position encoding strategies, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE, to effectively capture positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. - We propose LightNet, a new multi-dimensional linear attention model that can process high-dimensional sequences in a single scan. - We conduct thorough evaluations to assess the efficiency and efficacy of LightNet for multidimensional sequential modeling tasks. The LightNet demonstrates competitive performance in all scenarios. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLinear Attention. The linear attention mechanism has greatly advanced deep learning, particularly in natural language processing, by providing a scalable solution for long input sequences and reducing the computational demands of traditional attention models [8-11]. However, despite its faster training speeds, linear attention's performance still falls short of softmax attention due to the attention dilution issue [4]. The TNL/RetNet [2, 4] introduces a decay mechanism to address this problem. Additionally, GLA [12] incorporating gating mechanisms show the potential to enhance linear attention models. State Space Model. State Space Models (SSMs) are increasingly crucial in sequence modeling due to their structured approach to capturing temporal dynamics through latent variables. The S4 model [13] enhances state space modeling for long sequences by leveraging structured spaces to improve computational efficiency and tackle complex dynamics. With additional parameterizing and initializing diagonal state space strategy [14], the SSMs can achieve comparable performance to naive transformers. Furthermore, the Gated State Space (GSS) model [15] introduces a gating mechanism to SSMs, which is particularly effective for long-range language modeling by allowing nuanced control over information flow. The S5 model [16] reduces complexity using \"scan\" while maintaining the capability to handle intricate sequences. However, directly extending the SSM to multi-dimensional input usually requires multiple sequential scans, which will reduce the computational efficiency [6]. Linear RNN. Linear RNNs employ element-wise recursion for sequence modeling, and due to their linear recursive form, they can be accelerated using parallel scans [17]. At their core is the decay mechanism, where RWKV-4/LRU [1, 18] utilizes data-independent decay. HGRN [19, 20] leverage data-dependent decay to enhance performance. Linear RNNs have shown considerable potential in language modeling and long-sequence modeling tasks. Multi-dimensional Tasks with Linear Complexity Model. The development of linear attention in language models has led to its extension into multi-dimensional tasks. Building upon the cosFormer framework [10], VVT [21] explores a local prior of 2D linear attention and applies it to image classification tasks. Vim [6] and Vision-RWKV [5] utilize a sequential scan mechanism to expand\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ca5728fe5a821d021816g-03.jpg?height=526&width=1363&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=377)\n\nFigure 1: Processing time of 1 Scan and 2 Scan in relation to sequence length. 1 Scan is significantly faster than 2 Scan in both forward and backward passes. As the sequence length increases, the advantage of 1 Scan becomes more substantial. Mamba [22] and RWKV [23] for image classification. Additionally, leveraging the benefits structure of the diffusion transformer [24] in image generation, several works have extended linear complexity models into 2D space [25-28] to replace the traditional transformer architecture, achieving efficient image generation.\n```\n\n#### 2.

GLUE and SuperGLUE are widely-used benchmarks to evaluation the natrual language understanding capability of neural language models (Wang et al., 2019b;a). We finetune the models on a mixture of the tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE for simplicity. We evaluate the model on each task separately.

For reference, we present detailed results for all the models on each individual dataset in Table 13. In general, FIRE achieves decent performances. Thus, FIRE's strong performances on long sequences does not come at the price of sacrificing model quality on short sequences and standard tasks.

We notice that FIRE models learn both local and anti-local position patterns. ## C. 6 EFFICIENCY AND FIRE-SHARED\n\nFor FIRE-S (FIRE with layerwise sharing), we experiment with the base-sized model ( 125 M parameters), and keep all the configurations and training recipes the same as those in previous subsections. The models are pretrained on C4 with sequence length 2048. The finetuning sequence lengths are 8192/1024 for SCROLLS and GLUE/SuperGLUE, respectively. For the inference time evaluation, we test the forward time of base-sized model with different positional encodings on sequence length 2048. We measure the forward time on 4 TPUv2 chips for all the models, and report the average result over 10 runs. ## D RELated WORKS\n\nIn the main body of the paper, we cover the most relevant works to our paper (Sec. 2). In this section, we provide more discussions on related works. Length generalization. Many existing works show the length generalization failure of standard Transformer models (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Deletang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). Recently, there have been growing interests in long-context applications such as multi-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Dziri et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) and document/book understanding (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2018; Ke et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022; Ainslie et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Designing lengthgeneralizable Transformers is appealing for these applications. Dubois et al. (2020); Chowdhury \\& Caragea (2023) introduce location attention for length generalization on synthetic tasks. Bueno et al. (2022) show that generating step-by-step rationales and using marker tokens as positional guides helps length generalization. Studying positional encoding approaches for length generalization is a main direction in this line of research. Press et al. (2022); Chi et al. (2022; 2023) propose new relative positional encoding methods which emphasize recency bias and improve language modeling on longer sequences. Chu et al. (2023) propose Conditional Positional Encodings to enhance Vision Transformer length generalization. The most relevant to our work is a concurrent paper by Chen et al. (2023). It propose Position Interpolation (PI) for Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), which extends the context window of RoPE-based pretrained models given a downstream max sequence length. However, this requires additional finetuning on longer sequence data, albeit for much fewer steps than original training. By contrast, our proposed FIRE does not require a pre-defined max sequence length, and can be directly applied to length generalization setting without tuning. We provide extensive experimental comparisons in Sec.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/43 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nThe reported results are averaged over 10 runs for each method. Model quality. Table 2 compares the accuracy of FIRE-S and the standard FIRE. The results show that sharing position encoding function across layers only leads to a slight performance degradation. FIRE-S still outperforms other baselines in the long sequence regime. For example, on C4 language modeling with sequence length 8192, it outperforms Kerple, the best baseline in Fig. 1 ( 3.10 v.s. $3.16 \\log$ perplexity). On SCROLLS, its average score outperforms all the strong baseline methods including T5's RPE, RoPE with positional interpolation, and Kerple.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/43 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n${ }^{7}$ Model and training configurations are detailed in Appendix C.1. The results are shown in Fig. 1, 2, \\& 7. We first notice that FIRE consistently achieves lower perplexity across different model sizes, validation sequence lengths, and datasets. In comparison to existing approaches, the performance gain is particularly significant for validation sequences that are longer than training sequences (out-of-distribution sequence lengths), showing better length generalization behavior. For example, for base models trained on sequence length 2048 and evaluated on sequence length 8192, FIRE outperforms the best baseline method, Kerple, by 2.28 points ( 21.24 v.s. 23.52 perplexity). Methods such as RoPE achieve strong performance for in-distribution sequence lengths, but their performances quickly degrade with longer inputs. YaRN requires knowledge of target sequence length and further finetuning, but we can see from Fig. $1 \\& 7$ that it underperforms FIRE on long sequences and sacrifices model quality on short sequences (e.g., length 512). Note that in all our experiments, perplexity is computed in a single forward pass for a given input, and we do not use any sliding window tricks during inference (Press et al., 2022).

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer $\\left[\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}\\right.$17] has become the de facto architecture for large language models $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+} 20\\right]$, which was initially proposed to overcome the sequential training issue of recurrent models [HS97]. However, training parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the $O(N)$ complexity per step and memory-bound key-value cache [Sha19], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment. The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient $O(1)$ inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously, i.e., the so-called \"impossible triangle\" as shown in Figure 2. There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [KVPF20] approximates standard attention scores $\\exp (\\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k})$ with kernels $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, so that autoregressive inference can be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than Transformers, which hinders the method's popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators $\\left[\\mathrm{PAA}^{+} 23\\right]$ are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third line of research explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S 4 [GGR21], and its variants [DFS ${ }^{+}$22, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23]. None of the previous work can break through the impossible triangle, resulting in no clear winner compared with Transformers. In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient longsequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention, which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient $O(1)$ inference in terms of memory and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory. We conduct extensive experiments to compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning. Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8 k sequence length, RetNet decodes $8.4 \\times$ faster and saves $70 \\%$ of memory than Transformers with key-value caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 25-50\\% memory saving and $7 \\times$ acceleration than standard Transformer and an advantage towards highly-optimized FlashAttention $\\left[\\mathrm{DFE}^{+}\\right.$22]. Besides, RetNet's inference latency is insensitive to batch size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. ## 2 Retentive Networks\n\nRetentive network (RetNet) is stacked with $L$ identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e., residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17]. Each RetNet block contains two modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence $x=x_{1} \\cdots x_{|x|}$, RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{|x|}$ is first packed into $X^{0}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{|x|}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, where $d_{\\text {model }}$ is hidden dimension. Then we compute contextualized vector representations $X^{l}=\\operatorname{RetNet}_{l}\\left(X^{l-1}\\right), l \\in[1, L]$. ### 2.1 Retention\n\nIn this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference. Given input $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, we project it to one-dimensional function $v(n)=X_{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_{V}$. Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ through states $s_{n}$. Let $v_{n}, o_{n}$ denote $v(n), o(n)$ for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\ns_{n}=A s_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} v_{n}, & A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, K_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\no_{n}=Q_{n} s_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n} A^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m}, & Q_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we map $v_{n}$ to the state vector $s_{n}$, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence information recurrently. Next, we make the projection $Q_{n}, K_{n}$ content-aware:\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{Q}, W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable matrices. We diagonalize the matrix $A=\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\Lambda^{-1}$, where $\\gamma, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then we obtain $A^{n-m}=$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} \\Lambda^{-1}$. By absorbing $\\Lambda$ into $W_{Q}$ and $W_{K}$, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\no_{n} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)\\left(K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}\\right)^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} v_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}, K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}$ is known as xPos [SDP ${ }^{+}$22], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed for Transformer. We further simplify $\\gamma$ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n$$\no_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\gamma^{n-m}\\left(Q_{n} e^{i n \\theta}\\right)\\left(K_{m} e^{i m \\theta}\\right)^{\\dagger} v_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere ${ }^{\\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances. In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ as vectors and obtain the retention mechanism as follows. The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3a, the retention layer is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nQ=\\left(X W_{Q}\\right) \\odot \\Theta, \\quad K=\\left(X W_{K}\\right) \\odot \\bar{\\Theta}, \\quad V=X W_{V} \\\\\n\\Theta_{n}=e^{i n \\theta}, \\quad D_{n m}= \\begin{cases}\\gamma^{n-m}, & n \\geq m \\\\\n0, & n<m\\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Retention}(X)=\\left(Q K^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} \\odot D\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\Theta}$ is the complex conjugate of $\\Theta$, and $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times|x|}$ combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one matrix. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models with GPUs efficiently. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fb33982bc7545f33a227g-04.jpg?height=520&width=1245&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=526)\n\nFigure 3: Dual form of RetNet. \"GN\" is short for GroupNorm. The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3b, the proposed mechanism can also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the $n$-th timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{n}=\\gamma S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} V_{n} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{n}\\right)=Q_{n} S_{n}, \\quad n=1, \\cdots,|x|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V, \\gamma$ are the same as in Equation (5). The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention A hybrid form of parallel representation and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation (Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let $B$ denote the chunk length. We compute the retention output of the $i$-th chunk via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{[i]}=Q_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad K_{[i]}=K_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad V_{[i]}=V_{B i: B(i+1)} \\\\\n& R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\\top}\\left(V_{[i]} \\odot \\zeta\\right)+\\gamma^{B} R_{i-1}, \\quad \\zeta_{i j}=\\gamma^{B-i-1} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{[i]}\\right)= \\underbrace{\\left.Q_{[i]} K_{[i]}^{\\top} \\odot D\\right) V_{[i]}}_{\\text {Inner-Chunk }}+\\underbrace{\\left(Q_{[i]} R_{i-1}\\right) \\odot \\xi}_{\\text {Cross-Chunk }}, \\quad \\xi_{i j}=\\gamma^{i+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $[i]$ indicates the $i$-th chunk, i.e., $x_{[i]}=\\left[x_{(i-1) B+1}, \\cdots, x_{i B}\\right]$. ### 2.2 Gated Multi-Scale Retention\n\nWe use $h=d_{\\text {model }} / d$ retention heads in each layer, where $d$ is the head dimension. The heads use different parameter matrices $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns different $\\gamma$ for each head. For simplicity, we set $\\gamma$ identical among different layers and keep them fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [HG16, RZL17] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers. Formally, given input $X$, we define the layer as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma=1-2^{-5-\\operatorname{arange}(0, h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{head}_{i}=\\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X, \\gamma_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& Y=\\operatorname{GroupNorm}_{h}\\left(\\operatorname{Concat}\\left(\\operatorname{head}_{1}, \\cdots, \\text { head }_{h}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MSR}(X)=\\left(\\operatorname{swish}\\left(X W_{G}\\right) \\odot Y\\right) W_{O}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{G}, W_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [WH18] normalizes the output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [SPP ${ }^{+}$19].\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 0 related papers from 0 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: RetNet DCA FIRE integration\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers integrate Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) and Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE) into the Retentive Network (RetNet) for improved long-sequence processing, here are some key areas and potential sources of information to explore:\n\n### Challenges in Integration\n\n#### Computational Complexity\n- **Memory Management and Efficiency:**\n  - Investigate how the chunkwise recurrent computation paradigm of RetNet can be optimized to accommodate the intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention mechanisms of DCA.

Results of inference cost are reported with 8 k as input length. Figure 6 shows more results on different sequence lengths. [^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer $\\left[\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}\\right.$17] has become the de facto architecture for large language models $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+} 20\\right]$, which was initially proposed to overcome the sequential training issue of recurrent models [HS97]. However, training parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the $O(N)$ complexity per step and memory-bound key-value cache [Sha19], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment. The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient $O(1)$ inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously, i.e., the so-called \"impossible triangle\" as shown in Figure 2. There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [KVPF20] approximates standard attention scores $\\exp (\\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k})$ with kernels $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, so that autoregressive inference can be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than Transformers, which hinders the method's popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators $\\left[\\mathrm{PAA}^{+} 23\\right]$ are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third line of research explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S 4 [GGR21], and its variants [DFS ${ }^{+}$22, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23]. None of the previous work can break through the impossible triangle, resulting in no clear winner compared with Transformers. In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient longsequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention, which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient $O(1)$ inference in terms of memory and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory. We conduct extensive experiments to compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning. Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8 k sequence length, RetNet decodes $8.4 \\times$ faster and saves $70 \\%$ of memory than Transformers with key-value caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 25-50\\% memory saving and $7 \\times$ acceleration than standard Transformer and an advantage towards highly-optimized FlashAttention $\\left[\\mathrm{DFE}^{+}\\right.$22]. Besides, RetNet's inference latency is insensitive to batch size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. ## 2 Retentive Networks\n\nRetentive network (RetNet) is stacked with $L$ identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e., residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17]. Each RetNet block contains two modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence $x=x_{1} \\cdots x_{|x|}$, RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{|x|}$ is first packed into $X^{0}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{|x|}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, where $d_{\\text {model }}$ is hidden dimension. Then we compute contextualized vector representations $X^{l}=\\operatorname{RetNet}_{l}\\left(X^{l-1}\\right), l \\in[1, L]$. ### 2.1 Retention\n\nIn this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference. Given input $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, we project it to one-dimensional function $v(n)=X_{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_{V}$. Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ through states $s_{n}$. Let $v_{n}, o_{n}$ denote $v(n), o(n)$ for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\ns_{n}=A s_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} v_{n}, & A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, K_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\no_{n}=Q_{n} s_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n} A^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m}, & Q_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we map $v_{n}$ to the state vector $s_{n}$, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence information recurrently. Next, we make the projection $Q_{n}, K_{n}$ content-aware:\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{Q}, W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable matrices. We diagonalize the matrix $A=\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\Lambda^{-1}$, where $\\gamma, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then we obtain $A^{n-m}=$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} \\Lambda^{-1}$. By absorbing $\\Lambda$ into $W_{Q}$ and $W_{K}$, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\no_{n} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)\\left(K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}\\right)^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} v_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}, K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}$ is known as xPos [SDP ${ }^{+}$22], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed for Transformer. We further simplify $\\gamma$ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n$$\no_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\gamma^{n-m}\\left(Q_{n} e^{i n \\theta}\\right)\\left(K_{m} e^{i m \\theta}\\right)^{\\dagger} v_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere ${ }^{\\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances. In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ as vectors and obtain the retention mechanism as follows. The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3a, the retention layer is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nQ=\\left(X W_{Q}\\right) \\odot \\Theta, \\quad K=\\left(X W_{K}\\right) \\odot \\bar{\\Theta}, \\quad V=X W_{V} \\\\\n\\Theta_{n}=e^{i n \\theta}, \\quad D_{n m}= \\begin{cases}\\gamma^{n-m}, & n \\geq m \\\\\n0, & n<m\\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Retention}(X)=\\left(Q K^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} \\odot D\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\Theta}$ is the complex conjugate of $\\Theta$, and $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times|x|}$ combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one matrix. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models with GPUs efficiently. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fb33982bc7545f33a227g-04.jpg?height=520&width=1245&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=526)\n\nFigure 3: Dual form of RetNet. \"GN\" is short for GroupNorm. The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3b, the proposed mechanism can also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the $n$-th timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{n}=\\gamma S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} V_{n} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{n}\\right)=Q_{n} S_{n}, \\quad n=1, \\cdots,|x|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V, \\gamma$ are the same as in Equation (5). The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention A hybrid form of parallel representation and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation (Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let $B$ denote the chunk length. We compute the retention output of the $i$-th chunk via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{[i]}=Q_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad K_{[i]}=K_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad V_{[i]}=V_{B i: B(i+1)} \\\\\n& R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\\top}\\left(V_{[i]} \\odot \\zeta\\right)+\\gamma^{B} R_{i-1}, \\quad \\zeta_{i j}=\\gamma^{B-i-1} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{[i]}\\right)= \\underbrace{\\left.Q_{[i]} K_{[i]}^{\\top} \\odot D\\right) V_{[i]}}_{\\text {Inner-Chunk }}+\\underbrace{\\left(Q_{[i]} R_{i-1}\\right) \\odot \\xi}_{\\text {Cross-Chunk }}, \\quad \\xi_{i j}=\\gamma^{i+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $[i]$ indicates the $i$-th chunk, i.e., $x_{[i]}=\\left[x_{(i-1) B+1}, \\cdots, x_{i B}\\right]$. ### 2.2 Gated Multi-Scale Retention\n\nWe use $h=d_{\\text {model }} / d$ retention heads in each layer, where $d$ is the head dimension. The heads use different parameter matrices $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns different $\\gamma$ for each head. For simplicity, we set $\\gamma$ identical among different layers and keep them fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [HG16, RZL17] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers. Formally, given input $X$, we define the layer as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma=1-2^{-5-\\operatorname{arange}(0, h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{head}_{i}=\\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X, \\gamma_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& Y=\\operatorname{GroupNorm}_{h}\\left(\\operatorname{Concat}\\left(\\operatorname{head}_{1}, \\cdots, \\text { head }_{h}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MSR}(X)=\\left(\\operatorname{swish}\\left(X W_{G}\\right) \\odot Y\\right) W_{O}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{G}, W_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [WH18] normalizes the output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [SPP ${ }^{+}$19].\n```\n\n#### 2.

Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode. These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

Recent studies (Chen et al., 2023b; Su, 2023; Jin et al., 2024) mainly attribute this limitation to the presence of unseen relative positions in pretraining phase and propose to redesign the relative position matrix. As illustrated in the example in Figure 1, the model is trained on sequences of 6 tokens, while inference is carried out on a sequence of 12 tokens. This discrepancy can lead to a high PPL because relative positions beyond 6 were never trained. Previous approaches, such as PI and NTK, aim to mitigate this issue by reducing the magnitude of $M[i][j]$ to ensure it falls within the scope of the observed context length during training. For instance, applying PI in this example would adjust the position indices by scaling: $P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] \\Rightarrow P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] / 2$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j] \\Rightarrow P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j] / 2$. Consequently, the relative position matrix is also scaled: $M[i][j]=M[i][j] / 2$. Here, a scaling factor $2=\\frac{12}{6}$ is employed to scale down the relative positions, leading to inferior resolution of the position information and weak extrapolation ability. ## 3. Method\n\nIn this section, we describe our new training-free framework Dual Chunk Attention in detail. A running example of dual chunk attention is shown in figure 2. Our method starts from the intra-chunk attention (Figure 2 (a)) which is a chunkbased efficient attention pattern (Child et al., 2019; Song et al., 2023). The position embedding of each chunk ranges from 0 to chunk size where the chunk size is set to be smaller than pretraining length. The intra-chunk attention pattern practically means directly truncating the input from left to the chunk size discarding information from previous chunks. Such truncation usually brings low perplexity (Xiao et al., 2023) but loses long-range information. To address this limitation, we implement inter-chunk attention (Figure 2 (b)) that enables attention calculations between different chunks, albeit with less precision for distant token positions. Finally, we introduce successive-chunk attention, a variant of inter-chunk attention depicted in Figure 2 (c), which is specifically applied when two chunks are adjacent in order to preserve locality. An ablation study to show how these attention mechanisms influence PPL and passkey retrieval accuracy can be found in Figure 4. ### 3.1. Intra-Chunk Attention\n\nIntra-Chunk Attention is employed to calculate the inner product of queries and keys within the same chunk. For a long sequence of length $l$, we partition the sequence into $n=\\frac{l}{s}$ chunks, ensuring that the position indices within each chunk will not exceed the chunk size $s$. Figure 2 (a) illustrates the process of segmenting a sequence of 12 tokens exceeding the pretraining length 10 into 2 chunks, with each chunk comprising $s=6<10$ tokens. Then the position indices for keys and queries are scaled within the chunk size 6. Concretely, we have position indices for keys $P_{\\mathbf{k}}=[\\underbrace{0,1,2,3,4,5}_{\\text {chunk } 0}, \\underbrace{0,1,2,3,4,5}_{\\text {chunk } 1}]$ and $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}=P_{\\mathbf{k}}$, where $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}$ means position indices for queries during intra-chunk attention. To formalize, in intra-chunk attention, we adjust the position indices for queries and keys as follows:\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\mathrm{Intra}}=P_{\\mathbf{k}}=[0,1, \\ldots, l-1] \\quad \\bmod s\n$$\n\nFor the absolute indices $i$ and $j$ within the same chunk i.e., $\\lfloor i / s\\rfloor=\\lfloor j / s\\rfloor$, satisfying $0 \\leq j \\leq i<l$, the element $M[i][j]$ is defined as the difference between the positional encodings of the query and the key:\n\n$$\nM[i][j]=P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[i]-P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]\n$$\n\nWhen $\\lfloor i / s\\rfloor=\\lfloor j / s\\rfloor$, we calculate $M[i][j]$ follows Eq. 3 . The computed $M$ of the previous example where we have a sequence length of 12 and a chunk size of 6 , is illustrated in Figure 2 (a). The intra-chunk attention score for the interaction between the $i$-th query and the $j$-th key is then calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{j}=f\\left(\\mathbf{q}, P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[i]\\right)^{\\top} f\\left(\\mathbf{k}, P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.2. Inter-Chunk Attention\n\nTo aggregate information from other chunks, we introduce Inter-Chunk Attention. In Llama-based LLMs, the position indices for queries are greater than those of the keys to reflect the left-to-right information flow, i.e, we have $P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] \\geq P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]$ whenever $i \\geq j$. Using $P_{\\mathbf{q}}=P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}$ for attention calculation between different chunks clearly violates this property. For example, considering $\\mathbf{q}_{s}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{1}$ where $s$ is the chunk size, their relative distance given by $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[s]=0$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}[1]=1$ is -1 . We maintain the position\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1a646067648f461a1a70g-04.jpg?height=477&width=1369&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=343)\n\nFigure 2.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor (Avg.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding.

Right: Accuracy of three specific methods on passkey retrieval task. retrieval-augmented generation (Gao et al., 2024). However, enabling LLMs to process long contexts presents significant challenges. The OOD issue makes LLM struggle to process tokens beyond pretrained length, and quadratic complexity of attention introduces considerable training and inference costs. Although OOD issue could be addressed by zero-shot learning (Jin et al., 2024), fine-tuning (Chen et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023), or re-training (Sun et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022), the required memory and computation still increases quadratically with context length, as shown in Figure 1(a). To alleviate these issues, recent works restrict the attention window to pre-trained length, which reduces the computation cost and avoids the processing of OOD tokens. One direction is to exclude distant tokens (except for a few initial tokens, Han et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023) to restrict the attention window in-distribution, as shown in Figure 1(b). However, these methods could result in losing critical information, degrading performance on downstream tasks. The other way to constrain the attention window is to retrieve chunks of long sequences (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024), but these approaches usually require special operations and continuous fine-tuning, which makes it difficult for existing LLMs to be\ndirectly applicable to long sequences. In summary, improving the ability of LLMs to handle long contexts at a low cost is still challenging. In this paper, we propose LONGHEAds, a novel framework to enhance LLM's long context ability without additional training. The key idea is to fully unlock the potential of multi-head attention. We first utilize the nature of different heads focus on different subspaces of the context, and each head can effectively process sequences within the pre-training length. As shown in Figure 2 (c), we limit each head to selecting and attending to important contextual chunks within pre-trained length, rather than having each head attend to the entire sentence, thereby avoiding the OOD problem. Furthermore, we leverage the model's inherent dot-product attention and propose a chunk selection strategy to find important chunks for each head. Drawing inspiration from the fact that each head assigns different attention weights to tokens based on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, we break the input into chunks and create chunk-level features for each block. It utilizes native token-level correlation to construct chunk-level queries and key representations, which allows each head to utilize its existing capabilities (dot-product attention) to select chunks based on the attention weights. In this way, each head effectively processes selected context chunks within the trained length, and all heads in all layers work together to handle longer contexts. Meanwhile, all operations are based on the intrinsic capabilities of multi-head attention, allowing LONGHEADS to enhance LLMs without additional training. To evaluate the effectiveness of LONGHEADS, we employ LLaMA-2-7B-Base and LLaMA-2-7BChat as base models and evaluate on language modeling, synthetic retrieval task and long context benchmark. LONGHEADS achieving nearly $100 \\%$ accuracy across context lengths from 4 k to 32 k on the Passkey Retrieval task. On LongBench, LONGHEADS achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among restricted attention methods. Compared with full attention methods, LONGHEADS achieves comparable performance on 16 K test lengths and the best performance on 32 K test lengths while enjoying linear computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that LongHEADS enables the LLMs to directly generalize to longer sequences and achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to the methods that require continuous fine-tuning. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n- We propose LonGHEAds, a training-free inference framework that leverages the structural properties of attention heads to process long sequences efficiently and effectively. - We design a simple yet effective chunk selection strategy that can accurately select useful chunks and cover the full context. - Experiments demonstrate that LongHEADS is a SOTA restricted-attention-based long context processor and works efficiently in linear time, also with comparable performance to fullattention methods. ## 2 Method\n\nIn this section, we describe how the LongHEAds utilizes the inherent ability of multi-head attention to encode and generate long sequences without additional training. ### 2.1 Overview\n\nAn overview of LONGHEAdS is shown in Figure 2. We break the text into chunks and calculate the chunk representations for each chunk. When generating token $x_{14}$, we pick the relevant $k$ chunks based on the current token's query vector and chunk representations. In this way, each attention head of the LONGHEADS selectively focuses on different text chunks according to its preference. The tokens of attended chunks are then restructured, ensuring the subsequent causal attention always performed within the pre-trained length. When encoding or generating an out-of-length token, a parameter-free chunk selection network picks the relevant $k$ chunks based on the current query vector and chunk representations. Unpicked chunks can be approximated as having zero attention score (this usually holds under the sparsity of the attention mechanism), and do not need to be computed. This allows the attention matrix not to increase with length, significantly reducing the memory and computational cost of long contexts from $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ to $O(N)$. Other works that restrict the scope of attention simply ignore distant tokens beyond a few initial tokens, even if they contain information worthy of attention. In order to accurately select useful chunks, we utilize inherent similarity between token-level queries and token-level keys to construct chunklevel query and key representations. Taking the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_3615f90423194934de02g-03.jpg?height=466&width=1589&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=242)\n\nFigure 2: An overview of LongHEADS's inference, generating token $x_{14}$ in the current step. During inference, LONGHEADS keeps the first chunk for stable computation, combined with the last chunk containing recent tokens. 32K Passkey Retrieval experiment as an example, the chunk containing the answer (i.e., the most valuable one) is the chunk with the highest selection score in $98 \\%$ of the cases without being trained. ### 2.2 Chunk Representation\n\nChunk representation is an indicator of whether the tokens in this chunk should be attended to. We obtain chunk representations in a training-free manner by utilizing the attention's intrinsic abilities. Formally, given a long input sequence $X=$ $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$, we segment it into chunks according to a predefined chunk size $l$, then the input sequence can be denoted as $X=\\left(C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{m}\\right), m=\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{l}\\right\\rceil$. We use attention's key states to generate chunk representation for each chunk due to the existing attention mechanism relies on query states. There are numerous straightforward methods to obtain chunk representation, such as mean pooling of the key vectors of all tokens in the chunk. However, they have demonstrated suboptimal performance in preliminary experiments, particularly in selecting the correct chunks. We hypothesize that this is attributed to the significance of individual tokens within a chunk vary substantially. To address the above problem, we should identify the tokens that can represent the entire chunk. For that purpose, we evaluate each token's significance to the chunk and perform scaled attention aggregation on all tokens' key states to obtain a representative chunk representation as follows:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{c}_{i}=\\text { flash-attention }\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{c}, \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}, \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is the chunk representation, $\\boldsymbol{K}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d}$ is the attention's all key states of chunk $C_{i}, \\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is a query vector to indicate which token's key state is suitable for representing the chunk representation.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Dual Chunk Attention, Functional Interpolation, RetNet\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

To alleviate the complexity of long-sequence processing, we propose a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths. More specifically, our method divides each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then aligns the interchunk information during the encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards the decoders of transformers as environments, and the downstream performance metrics as the rewards to evaluate the hidden selection actions. Our empirical results on real-world long-text summarization and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate effective improvements compared to prior longsequence processing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Previous studies have predominantly focused on speaker-aware context modeling, overlooking the discourse structure of the conversation. In this paper, we introduce Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC. Specifically, we devise a Discourse-aware GAT (DisGAT) module to incorporate discourse structural information by analyzing the discourse dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we develop a Speaker-aware GAT (SpkGAT) module to incorporate speaker-aware contextual information by considering the speaker dependencies between utterances. Furthermore, we design an interaction module that facilitates the integration of the DisGAT and SpkGAT modules, enabling the effective interchange of relevant information between the two modules.

Existing MLP-based architectures generate worse samples than the grid-based generators with favorable convolutional inductive biases. Models that focus on generating images at different scales do better, but employ complex architectures not designed for continuous evaluation of images and derivatives. We take a signal-processing perspective and treat continuous image generation as interpolation from samples. Indeed, correctly sampled discrete images contain all information about the low spatial frequencies. The question is then how to extrapolate the spectrum in a data-driven way while meeting the above design criteria. Our answer is FunkNN -- a new convolutional network which learns how to reconstruct continuous images at arbitrary coordinates and can be applied to any image dataset. Combined with a discrete generative model it becomes a functional generator which can act as a prior in continuous ill-posed inverse problems. We show that FunkNN generates high-quality continuous images and exhibits strong out-of-distribution performance thanks to its patch-based design.

We use the quantum algorithms for solving linear ordinary differential equations to solve the Fokker--Planck equation and prepare a quantum state encoding the Gibbs distribution. We show that the efficiency of interpolation and differentiation of these functions on a quantum computer depends on the rate of decay of the Fourier coefficients of the Fourier transform of the function. We view this property as a concentration of measure in the Fourier domain, and also provide functional analytic conditions for it. Our algorithm makes zeroeth order queries to a quantum oracle of the function. Despite suffering from an exponentially long mixing time, this algorithm allows for exponentially improved precision in sampling, and polynomial quantum speedups in mean estimation in the general case, and particularly under geometric conditions we identify for the critical points of the energy function.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Improving Token-Based World Models with Parallel Observation Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Lior Cohen, Kaixin Wang, Bingyi Kang, Shie Mannor*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work incorporates a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward mode tailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12 hours.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Training-Free Long-Context Scaling of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dual Chunk Attention*\n\n*Chenxin An, Fei Huang, Jun Zhang, Shansan Gong, Xipeng Qiu, Chang Zhou, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate coherent\ntext is markedly weakened when the number of input tokens exceeds their\npretraining length. Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale\nmodels with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which\nenables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without\ncontinual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences\ninto chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative\npositional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across\ndistinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash\nAttention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves\nperformance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even\nbetter than that of finetuned models.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational\nnetwork architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance\nhas yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

MossFormer: Pushing the Performance Limit of Monaural Speech Separation using Gated Single-Head Transformer with Convolution-Augmented Joint Self-Attentions\n\n*From Search Query: Dual Chunk Attention*\n\n*Bin Ma, Shengkui Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer based models have provided significant performance improvements in monaural speech separation. However, there is still a performance gap compared to a recent proposed upper bound. The major limitation of the current dual-path Transformer models is the inefficient modelling of long-range elemental interactions and local feature patterns. In this work, we achieve the upper bound by proposing a gated single-head transformer architecture with convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, named \\textit{MossFormer} (\\textit{Mo}naural \\textit{s}peech \\textit{s}eparation Trans\\textit{Former}). To effectively solve the indirect elemental interactions across chunks in the dual-path architecture, MossFormer employs a joint local and global self-attention architecture that simultaneously performs a full-computation self-attention on local chunks and a linearised low-cost self-attention over the full sequence. The joint attention enables MossFormer model full-sequence elemental interaction directly. In addition, we employ a powerful attentive gating mechanism with simplified single-head self-attentions. Besides the attentive long-range modelling, we also augment MossFormer with convolutions for the position-wise local pattern modelling. As a consequence, MossFormer significantly outperforms the previous models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on WSJ0-2/3mix and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks. Our model achieves the SI-SDRi upper bound of 21.2 dB on WSJ0-3mix and only 0.3 dB below the upper bound of 23.1 dB on WSJ0-2mix.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-23\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Magnitude-Corrected and Time-Aligned Interpolation of Head-Related Transfer Functions\n\n*From Search Query: Functional Interpolation*\n\n*Fabian Brinkmann, Stefan Weinzierl, Christoph P\u00f6rschmann, Johannes M. Arend*\n\n**Abstract:** Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are essential for virtual acoustic realities, as they contain all cues for localizing sound sources in three-dimensional space. Acoustic measurements are one way to obtain high-quality HRTFs. To reduce measurement time, cost, and complexity of measurement systems, a promising approach is to capture only a few HRTFs on a sparse sampling grid and then upsample them to a dense HRTF set by interpolation. However, HRTF interpolation is challenging because small changes in source position can result in significant changes in the HRTF phase and magnitude response. Previous studies greatly improved the interpolation by time-aligning the HRTFs in preprocessing, but magnitude interpolation errors, especially in contralateral regions, remain a problem. Building upon the time-alignment approaches, we propose an additional post-interpolation magnitude correction derived from a frequency-smoothed HRTF representation. Employing all 96 individual simulated HRTF sets of the HUTUBS database, we show that the magnitude correction significantly reduces interpolation errors compared to state-of-the-art interpolation methods applying only time alignment. Our analysis shows that when upsampling very sparse HRTF sets, the subject-averaged magnitude error in the critical higher frequency range is up to 1.5 dB lower when averaged over all directions and even up to 4 dB lower in the contralateral region. As a result, the interaural level differences in the upsampled HRTFs are considerably improved. The proposed algorithm thus has the potential to further reduce the minimum number of HRTFs required for perceptually transparent interpolation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Toward a Deeper Understanding: RetNet Viewed through Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Chaoning Zhang, Chenghao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of Vision Transformer (ViT) has been widely reported on a wide range of image recognition tasks. ViT can learn global dependencies superior to CNN, yet CNN's inherent locality can substitute for expensive training resources. Recently, the outstanding performance of RetNet in the field of language modeling has garnered attention, surpassing that of the Transformer with explicit local modeling, shifting researchers' focus towards Transformers in the CV field. This paper investigates the effectiveness of RetNet from a CNN perspective and presents a variant of RetNet tailored to the visual domain. Similar to RetNet we improves ViT's local modeling by applying a weight mask on the original self-attention matrix. A straightforward way to locally adapt the self-attention matrix can be realized by an element-wise learnable weight mask (ELM), for which our preliminary results show promising results. However, the element-wise simple learnable weight mask not only induces a non-trivial additional parameter overhead but also increases the optimization complexity. To this end, this work proposes a novel Gaussian mixture mask (GMM) in which one mask only has two learnable parameters and it can be conveniently used in any ViT variants whose attention mechanism allows the use of masks. Experimental results on multiple small datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our proposed Gaussian mask for boosting ViTs for free (almost zero additional parameter or computation cost).

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer $\\left[\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}\\right.$17] has become the de facto architecture for large language models $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+} 20\\right]$, which was initially proposed to overcome the sequential training issue of recurrent models [HS97]. However, training parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the $O(N)$ complexity per step and memory-bound key-value cache [Sha19], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment. The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient $O(1)$ inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously, i.e., the so-called \"impossible triangle\" as shown in Figure 2. There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [KVPF20] approximates standard attention scores $\\exp (\\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k})$ with kernels $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, so that autoregressive inference can be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than Transformers, which hinders the method's popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators $\\left[\\mathrm{PAA}^{+} 23\\right]$ are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third line of research explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S 4 [GGR21], and its variants [DFS ${ }^{+}$22, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23]. None of the previous work can break through the impossible triangle, resulting in no clear winner compared with Transformers. In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient longsequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention, which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient $O(1)$ inference in terms of memory and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory. We conduct extensive experiments to compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning. Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8 k sequence length, RetNet decodes $8.4 \\times$ faster and saves $70 \\%$ of memory than Transformers with key-value caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 25-50\\% memory saving and $7 \\times$ acceleration than standard Transformer and an advantage towards highly-optimized FlashAttention $\\left[\\mathrm{DFE}^{+}\\right.$22]. Besides, RetNet's inference latency is insensitive to batch size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. ## 2 Retentive Networks\n\nRetentive network (RetNet) is stacked with $L$ identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e., residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17]. Each RetNet block contains two modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence $x=x_{1} \\cdots x_{|x|}$, RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{|x|}$ is first packed into $X^{0}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{|x|}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, where $d_{\\text {model }}$ is hidden dimension. Then we compute contextualized vector representations $X^{l}=\\operatorname{RetNet}_{l}\\left(X^{l-1}\\right), l \\in[1, L]$. ### 2.1 Retention\n\nIn this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference. Given input $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, we project it to one-dimensional function $v(n)=X_{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_{V}$. Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ through states $s_{n}$. Let $v_{n}, o_{n}$ denote $v(n), o(n)$ for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\ns_{n}=A s_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} v_{n}, & A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, K_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\no_{n}=Q_{n} s_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n} A^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m}, & Q_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we map $v_{n}$ to the state vector $s_{n}$, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence information recurrently. Next, we make the projection $Q_{n}, K_{n}$ content-aware:\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{Q}, W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable matrices. We diagonalize the matrix $A=\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\Lambda^{-1}$, where $\\gamma, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then we obtain $A^{n-m}=$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} \\Lambda^{-1}$. By absorbing $\\Lambda$ into $W_{Q}$ and $W_{K}$, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\no_{n} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)\\left(K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}\\right)^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} v_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}, K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}$ is known as xPos [SDP ${ }^{+}$22], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed for Transformer. We further simplify $\\gamma$ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n$$\no_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\gamma^{n-m}\\left(Q_{n} e^{i n \\theta}\\right)\\left(K_{m} e^{i m \\theta}\\right)^{\\dagger} v_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere ${ }^{\\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances. In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ as vectors and obtain the retention mechanism as follows. The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3a, the retention layer is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nQ=\\left(X W_{Q}\\right) \\odot \\Theta, \\quad K=\\left(X W_{K}\\right) \\odot \\bar{\\Theta}, \\quad V=X W_{V} \\\\\n\\Theta_{n}=e^{i n \\theta}, \\quad D_{n m}= \\begin{cases}\\gamma^{n-m}, & n \\geq m \\\\\n0, & n<m\\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Retention}(X)=\\left(Q K^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} \\odot D\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\Theta}$ is the complex conjugate of $\\Theta$, and $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times|x|}$ combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one matrix. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models with GPUs efficiently. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fb33982bc7545f33a227g-04.jpg?height=520&width=1245&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=526)\n\nFigure 3: Dual form of RetNet. \"GN\" is short for GroupNorm. The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3b, the proposed mechanism can also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the $n$-th timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{n}=\\gamma S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} V_{n} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{n}\\right)=Q_{n} S_{n}, \\quad n=1, \\cdots,|x|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V, \\gamma$ are the same as in Equation (5). The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention A hybrid form of parallel representation and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation (Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let $B$ denote the chunk length. We compute the retention output of the $i$-th chunk via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{[i]}=Q_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad K_{[i]}=K_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad V_{[i]}=V_{B i: B(i+1)} \\\\\n& R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\\top}\\left(V_{[i]} \\odot \\zeta\\right)+\\gamma^{B} R_{i-1}, \\quad \\zeta_{i j}=\\gamma^{B-i-1} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{[i]}\\right)= \\underbrace{\\left.Q_{[i]} K_{[i]}^{\\top} \\odot D\\right) V_{[i]}}_{\\text {Inner-Chunk }}+\\underbrace{\\left(Q_{[i]} R_{i-1}\\right) \\odot \\xi}_{\\text {Cross-Chunk }}, \\quad \\xi_{i j}=\\gamma^{i+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $[i]$ indicates the $i$-th chunk, i.e., $x_{[i]}=\\left[x_{(i-1) B+1}, \\cdots, x_{i B}\\right]$. ### 2.2 Gated Multi-Scale Retention\n\nWe use $h=d_{\\text {model }} / d$ retention heads in each layer, where $d$ is the head dimension. The heads use different parameter matrices $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns different $\\gamma$ for each head. For simplicity, we set $\\gamma$ identical among different layers and keep them fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [HG16, RZL17] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers. Formally, given input $X$, we define the layer as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma=1-2^{-5-\\operatorname{arange}(0, h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{head}_{i}=\\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X, \\gamma_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& Y=\\operatorname{GroupNorm}_{h}\\left(\\operatorname{Concat}\\left(\\operatorname{head}_{1}, \\cdots, \\text { head }_{h}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MSR}(X)=\\left(\\operatorname{swish}\\left(X W_{G}\\right) \\odot Y\\right) W_{O}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{G}, W_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [WH18] normalizes the output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [SPP ${ }^{+}$19].\n```\n\n#### 2.

Training-Free Long-Context Scaling of Large Language Models (Avg.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

Extrapolation of RoPE\n\nRecent work (Chen et al., 2023b; Chowdhury \\& Caragea, 2023; Chen et al., 2023a) has demonstrated that LLMs with the original RoPE lack robust length extrapolation capabilities, typically resulting in performance degradation when\n\n[^2]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1a646067648f461a1a70g-03.jpg?height=478&width=483&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=344)\n\nFigure 1.

Each matrix entry $M[i][j]$ represents the relative positional offset $P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i]-P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]$. tested on input sequences longer than those seen during pretraining (Li et al., 2023b; Zhu et al., 2023). Recent studies (Chen et al., 2023b; Su, 2023; Jin et al., 2024) mainly attribute this limitation to the presence of unseen relative positions in pretraining phase and propose to redesign the relative position matrix. As illustrated in the example in Figure 1, the model is trained on sequences of 6 tokens, while inference is carried out on a sequence of 12 tokens. This discrepancy can lead to a high PPL because relative positions beyond 6 were never trained. Previous approaches, such as PI and NTK, aim to mitigate this issue by reducing the magnitude of $M[i][j]$ to ensure it falls within the scope of the observed context length during training. For instance, applying PI in this example would adjust the position indices by scaling: $P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] \\Rightarrow P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] / 2$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j] \\Rightarrow P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j] / 2$. Consequently, the relative position matrix is also scaled: $M[i][j]=M[i][j] / 2$. Here, a scaling factor $2=\\frac{12}{6}$ is employed to scale down the relative positions, leading to inferior resolution of the position information and weak extrapolation ability. ## 3. Method\n\nIn this section, we describe our new training-free framework Dual Chunk Attention in detail. A running example of dual chunk attention is shown in figure 2. Our method starts from the intra-chunk attention (Figure 2 (a)) which is a chunkbased efficient attention pattern (Child et al., 2019; Song et al., 2023). The position embedding of each chunk ranges from 0 to chunk size where the chunk size is set to be smaller than pretraining length. The intra-chunk attention pattern practically means directly truncating the input from left to the chunk size discarding information from previous chunks. Such truncation usually brings low perplexity (Xiao et al., 2023) but loses long-range information. To address this limitation, we implement inter-chunk attention (Figure 2 (b)) that enables attention calculations between different chunks, albeit with less precision for distant token positions. Finally, we introduce successive-chunk attention, a variant of inter-chunk attention depicted in Figure 2 (c), which is specifically applied when two chunks are adjacent in order to preserve locality. An ablation study to show how these attention mechanisms influence PPL and passkey retrieval accuracy can be found in Figure 4. ### 3.1. Intra-Chunk Attention\n\nIntra-Chunk Attention is employed to calculate the inner product of queries and keys within the same chunk. For a long sequence of length $l$, we partition the sequence into $n=\\frac{l}{s}$ chunks, ensuring that the position indices within each chunk will not exceed the chunk size $s$. Figure 2 (a) illustrates the process of segmenting a sequence of 12 tokens exceeding the pretraining length 10 into 2 chunks, with each chunk comprising $s=6<10$ tokens. Then the position indices for keys and queries are scaled within the chunk size 6. Concretely, we have position indices for keys $P_{\\mathbf{k}}=[\\underbrace{0,1,2,3,4,5}_{\\text {chunk } 0}, \\underbrace{0,1,2,3,4,5}_{\\text {chunk } 1}]$ and $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}=P_{\\mathbf{k}}$, where $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}$ means position indices for queries during intra-chunk attention. To formalize, in intra-chunk attention, we adjust the position indices for queries and keys as follows:\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\mathrm{Intra}}=P_{\\mathbf{k}}=[0,1, \\ldots, l-1] \\quad \\bmod s\n$$\n\nFor the absolute indices $i$ and $j$ within the same chunk i.e., $\\lfloor i / s\\rfloor=\\lfloor j / s\\rfloor$, satisfying $0 \\leq j \\leq i<l$, the element $M[i][j]$ is defined as the difference between the positional encodings of the query and the key:\n\n$$\nM[i][j]=P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[i]-P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]\n$$\n\nWhen $\\lfloor i / s\\rfloor=\\lfloor j / s\\rfloor$, we calculate $M[i][j]$ follows Eq. 3 . The computed $M$ of the previous example where we have a sequence length of 12 and a chunk size of 6 , is illustrated in Figure 2 (a). The intra-chunk attention score for the interaction between the $i$-th query and the $j$-th key is then calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{j}=f\\left(\\mathbf{q}, P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[i]\\right)^{\\top} f\\left(\\mathbf{k}, P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.2. Inter-Chunk Attention\n\nTo aggregate information from other chunks, we introduce Inter-Chunk Attention. In Llama-based LLMs, the position indices for queries are greater than those of the keys to reflect the left-to-right information flow, i.e, we have $P_{\\mathbf{q}}[i] \\geq P_{\\mathbf{k}}[j]$ whenever $i \\geq j$. Using $P_{\\mathbf{q}}=P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}$ for attention calculation between different chunks clearly violates this property. For example, considering $\\mathbf{q}_{s}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{1}$ where $s$ is the chunk size, their relative distance given by $P_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\text {Intra }}[s]=0$ and $P_{\\mathbf{k}}[1]=1$ is -1 . We maintain the position\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1a646067648f461a1a70g-04.jpg?height=477&width=1369&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=343)\n\nFigure 2.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.26)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Right: Accuracy of three specific methods on passkey retrieval task. retrieval-augmented generation (Gao et al., 2024). However, enabling LLMs to process long contexts presents significant challenges. The OOD issue makes LLM struggle to process tokens beyond pretrained length, and quadratic complexity of attention introduces considerable training and inference costs. Although OOD issue could be addressed by zero-shot learning (Jin et al., 2024), fine-tuning (Chen et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023), or re-training (Sun et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022), the required memory and computation still increases quadratically with context length, as shown in Figure 1(a). To alleviate these issues, recent works restrict the attention window to pre-trained length, which reduces the computation cost and avoids the processing of OOD tokens. One direction is to exclude distant tokens (except for a few initial tokens, Han et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023) to restrict the attention window in-distribution, as shown in Figure 1(b). However, these methods could result in losing critical information, degrading performance on downstream tasks. The other way to constrain the attention window is to retrieve chunks of long sequences (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024), but these approaches usually require special operations and continuous fine-tuning, which makes it difficult for existing LLMs to be\ndirectly applicable to long sequences. In summary, improving the ability of LLMs to handle long contexts at a low cost is still challenging. In this paper, we propose LONGHEAds, a novel framework to enhance LLM's long context ability without additional training. The key idea is to fully unlock the potential of multi-head attention. We first utilize the nature of different heads focus on different subspaces of the context, and each head can effectively process sequences within the pre-training length. As shown in Figure 2 (c), we limit each head to selecting and attending to important contextual chunks within pre-trained length, rather than having each head attend to the entire sentence, thereby avoiding the OOD problem. Furthermore, we leverage the model's inherent dot-product attention and propose a chunk selection strategy to find important chunks for each head. Drawing inspiration from the fact that each head assigns different attention weights to tokens based on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, we break the input into chunks and create chunk-level features for each block. It utilizes native token-level correlation to construct chunk-level queries and key representations, which allows each head to utilize its existing capabilities (dot-product attention) to select chunks based on the attention weights. In this way, each head effectively processes selected context chunks within the trained length, and all heads in all layers work together to handle longer contexts. Meanwhile, all operations are based on the intrinsic capabilities of multi-head attention, allowing LONGHEADS to enhance LLMs without additional training. To evaluate the effectiveness of LONGHEADS, we employ LLaMA-2-7B-Base and LLaMA-2-7BChat as base models and evaluate on language modeling, synthetic retrieval task and long context benchmark. LONGHEADS achieving nearly $100 \\%$ accuracy across context lengths from 4 k to 32 k on the Passkey Retrieval task. On LongBench, LONGHEADS achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among restricted attention methods. Compared with full attention methods, LONGHEADS achieves comparable performance on 16 K test lengths and the best performance on 32 K test lengths while enjoying linear computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that LongHEADS enables the LLMs to directly generalize to longer sequences and achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to the methods that require continuous fine-tuning. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n- We propose LonGHEAds, a training-free inference framework that leverages the structural properties of attention heads to process long sequences efficiently and effectively. - We design a simple yet effective chunk selection strategy that can accurately select useful chunks and cover the full context. - Experiments demonstrate that LongHEADS is a SOTA restricted-attention-based long context processor and works efficiently in linear time, also with comparable performance to fullattention methods. ## 2 Method\n\nIn this section, we describe how the LongHEAds utilizes the inherent ability of multi-head attention to encode and generate long sequences without additional training. ### 2.1 Overview\n\nAn overview of LONGHEAdS is shown in Figure 2. We break the text into chunks and calculate the chunk representations for each chunk. When generating token $x_{14}$, we pick the relevant $k$ chunks based on the current token's query vector and chunk representations. In this way, each attention head of the LONGHEADS selectively focuses on different text chunks according to its preference. The tokens of attended chunks are then restructured, ensuring the subsequent causal attention always performed within the pre-trained length. When encoding or generating an out-of-length token, a parameter-free chunk selection network picks the relevant $k$ chunks based on the current query vector and chunk representations. Unpicked chunks can be approximated as having zero attention score (this usually holds under the sparsity of the attention mechanism), and do not need to be computed. This allows the attention matrix not to increase with length, significantly reducing the memory and computational cost of long contexts from $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ to $O(N)$.

During inference, LONGHEADS keeps the first chunk for stable computation, combined with the last chunk containing recent tokens. 32K Passkey Retrieval experiment as an example, the chunk containing the answer (i.e., the most valuable one) is the chunk with the highest selection score in $98 \\%$ of the cases without being trained. ### 2.2 Chunk Representation\n\nChunk representation is an indicator of whether the tokens in this chunk should be attended to. We obtain chunk representations in a training-free manner by utilizing the attention's intrinsic abilities. Formally, given a long input sequence $X=$ $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$, we segment it into chunks according to a predefined chunk size $l$, then the input sequence can be denoted as $X=\\left(C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{m}\\right), m=\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{l}\\right\\rceil$. We use attention's key states to generate chunk representation for each chunk due to the existing attention mechanism relies on query states. There are numerous straightforward methods to obtain chunk representation, such as mean pooling of the key vectors of all tokens in the chunk. However, they have demonstrated suboptimal performance in preliminary experiments, particularly in selecting the correct chunks. We hypothesize that this is attributed to the significance of individual tokens within a chunk vary substantially. To address the above problem, we should identify the tokens that can represent the entire chunk. For that purpose, we evaluate each token's significance to the chunk and perform scaled attention aggregation on all tokens' key states to obtain a representative chunk representation as follows:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{c}_{i}=\\text { flash-attention }\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{c}, \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}, \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is the chunk representation, $\\boldsymbol{K}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d}$ is the attention's all key states of chunk $C_{i}, \\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is a query vector to indicate which token's key state is suitable for representing the chunk representation.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: RetNet, Dual Chunk Attention, FIRE\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Improving Token-Based World Models with Parallel Observation Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Lior Cohen, Kaixin Wang, Bingyi Kang, Shie Mannor*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work incorporates a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward mode tailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12 hours.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Chunk, Align, Select: A Simple Long-sequence Processing Method for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Dual Chunk Attention*\n\n*Jiawen Xie, Pengyu Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yong Dai, Nan Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths.\n\n**Abstract:** Although dominant in natural language processing, transformer-based models remain challenged by the task of long-sequence processing, because the computational cost of self-attention operations in transformers swells quadratically with the input sequence length. To alleviate the complexity of long-sequence processing, we propose a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths. More specifically, our method divides each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then aligns the interchunk information during the encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards the decoders of transformers as environments, and the downstream performance metrics as the rewards to evaluate the hidden selection actions. Our empirical results on real-world long-text summarization and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate effective improvements compared to prior longsequence processing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Previous studies have predominantly focused on speaker-aware context modeling, overlooking the discourse structure of the conversation. In this paper, we introduce Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC. Specifically, we devise a Discourse-aware GAT (DisGAT) module to incorporate discourse structural information by analyzing the discourse dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we develop a Speaker-aware GAT (SpkGAT) module to incorporate speaker-aware contextual information by considering the speaker dependencies between utterances. Furthermore, we design an interaction module that facilitates the integration of the DisGAT and SpkGAT modules, enabling the effective interchange of relevant information between the two modules. We extensively evaluate our method on four datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DualGATs surpass state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of the datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5.

To combat this emerging risk of LLMs, we propose a novel\"Fighting Fire with Fire\"(F3) strategy that harnesses modern LLMs' generative and emergent reasoning capabilities to counter human-written and LLM-generated disinformation.

In our extensive experiments, we observe GPT-3.5-turbo's zero-shot superiority for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, where GPT-3.5-turbo consistently achieved accuracy at 68-72%, unlike the decline observed in previous customized and fine-tuned disinformation detectors.

GLIF: A Unified Gated Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: FIRE*\n\n*Xing-Hua Yao, Fanrong Li, Zitao Mo, Jianguo Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio- features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons and increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiker neurons.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been studied over decades to incorporate their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency. Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF, gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

Training-Free Long-Context Scaling of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dual Chunk Attention*\n\n*Chenxin An, Fei Huang, Jun Zhang, Shansan Gong, Xipeng Qiu, Chang Zhou, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate coherent\ntext is markedly weakened when the number of input tokens exceeds their\npretraining length. Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale\nmodels with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which\nenables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without\ncontinual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences\ninto chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative\npositional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across\ndistinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash\nAttention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves\nperformance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even\nbetter than that of finetuned models.

Toward a Deeper Understanding: RetNet Viewed through Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet*\n\n*Chaoning Zhang, Chenghao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of Vision Transformer (ViT) has been widely reported on a wide range of image recognition tasks. ViT can learn global dependencies superior to CNN, yet CNN's inherent locality can substitute for expensive training resources. Recently, the outstanding performance of RetNet in the field of language modeling has garnered attention, surpassing that of the Transformer with explicit local modeling, shifting researchers' focus towards Transformers in the CV field. This paper investigates the effectiveness of RetNet from a CNN perspective and presents a variant of RetNet tailored to the visual domain. Similar to RetNet we improves ViT's local modeling by applying a weight mask on the original self-attention matrix. A straightforward way to locally adapt the self-attention matrix can be realized by an element-wise learnable weight mask (ELM), for which our preliminary results show promising results. However, the element-wise simple learnable weight mask not only induces a non-trivial additional parameter overhead but also increases the optimization complexity. To this end, this work proposes a novel Gaussian mixture mask (GMM) in which one mask only has two learnable parameters and it can be conveniently used in any ViT variants whose attention mechanism allows the use of masks. Experimental results on multiple small datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our proposed Gaussian mask for boosting ViTs for free (almost zero additional parameter or computation cost).

MossFormer: Pushing the Performance Limit of Monaural Speech Separation using Gated Single-Head Transformer with Convolution-Augmented Joint Self-Attentions\n\n*From Search Query: Dual Chunk Attention*\n\n*Bin Ma, Shengkui Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer based models have provided significant performance improvements in monaural speech separation. However, there is still a performance gap compared to a recent proposed upper bound. The major limitation of the current dual-path Transformer models is the inefficient modelling of long-range elemental interactions and local feature patterns. In this work, we achieve the upper bound by proposing a gated single-head transformer architecture with convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, named \\textit{MossFormer} (\\textit{Mo}naural \\textit{s}peech \\textit{s}eparation Trans\\textit{Former}). To effectively solve the indirect elemental interactions across chunks in the dual-path architecture, MossFormer employs a joint local and global self-attention architecture that simultaneously performs a full-computation self-attention on local chunks and a linearised low-cost self-attention over the full sequence. The joint attention enables MossFormer model full-sequence elemental interaction directly. In addition, we employ a powerful attentive gating mechanism with simplified single-head self-attentions. Besides the attentive long-range modelling, we also augment MossFormer with convolutions for the position-wise local pattern modelling. As a consequence, MossFormer significantly outperforms the previous models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on WSJ0-2/3mix and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks. Our model achieves the SI-SDRi upper bound of 21.2 dB on WSJ0-3mix and only 0.3 dB below the upper bound of 23.1 dB on WSJ0-2mix.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-23\n\n\n\n#### 3.

FireNet: A Specialized Lightweight Fire & Smoke Detection Model for Real-Time IoT Applications\n\n*From Search Query: FIRE*\n\n*Mohd. Omama, Arpit Jadon, Akshay Varshney, Rishabh Sharma, Mohammad Samar Ansari*\n\n**Abstract:** Fire disasters typically result in lot of loss to life and property. It is therefore imperative that precise, fast, and possibly portable solutions to detect fire be made readily available to the masses at reasonable prices. There have been several research attempts to design effective and appropriately priced fire detection systems with varying degrees of success. However, most of them demonstrate a trade-off between performance and model size (which decides the model's ability to be installed on portable devices). The work presented in this paper is an attempt to deal with both the performance and model size issues in one design. Toward that end, a `designed-from-scratch' neural network, named FireNet, is proposed which is worthy on both the counts: (i) it has better performance than existing counterparts, and (ii) it is lightweight enough to be deploy-able on embedded platforms like Raspberry Pi. Performance evaluations on a standard dataset, as well as our own newly introduced custom-compiled fire dataset, are extremely encouraging.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design by integrating Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) and Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE) into the Retentive Network (RetNet), here are some key points and areas to focus on:\n\n## Integration Benefits and Mechanisms\n\n- **Dual Chunk Attention (DCA):** DCA decomposes attention into intra-chunk and inter-chunk modules, which allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. This mechanism can significantly reduce memory usage and computational cost, making it more feasible for long-sequence processing.\n\n- **Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE):** FIRE enhances the model's ability to generalize to longer contexts by using functional interpolation for relative positions. This improves the positional encoding, which is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Computational Complexity and Memory Management:**\n  - When integrating DCA and FIRE into RetNet, it is essential to analyze the computational complexity and memory requirements. RetNet's design supports parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent computation paradigms, which can help in managing the complexity introduced by DCA and FIRE.\n  - Investigate how the intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention mechanisms of DCA can be optimized within RetNet's architecture to maintain efficiency.\n\n- **Optimization Techniques:**\n  - Explore optimization techniques such as sparse attention, hierarchical attention, or other efficient attention mechanisms that can be combined with DCA and FIRE to further reduce computational costs.\n  - Consider using mixed precision training or other hardware-specific optimizations to improve training and inference efficiency.\n\n## Potential Challenges and Limitations\n\n- **Sequence Length Generalization:**\n  - While DCA and FIRE are designed to improve context length generalization, there might be limitations in how well these mechanisms scale to extremely long sequences. Conduct experiments to evaluate the model's performance on sequences of varying lengths.\n  - Investigate any potential trade-offs between sequence length and model accuracy or robustness.\n\n- **Training Stability:**\n  - The integration of new components can sometimes lead to training instability. Monitor training metrics closely and consider techniques like gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, or other stabilization methods to ensure stable training.\n\n## Recent Developments and Unpublished Works\n\n- **ArXiv and Research Preprints:**\n  - Regularly check arXiv and other preprint repositories for recent works that might have explored similar integrations or related techniques. This can provide insights into any new methods or optimizations that could be applied to the RetNet architecture.\n\n- **Conference Proceedings and Workshops:**\n  - Attend or review proceedings from relevant conferences (e.g., NIPS, ICLR, ACL) and workshops focused on natural language processing and deep learning. These often feature cutting-edge research that may not yet be widely published.\n\n## Experimental Evaluation\n\n- **Benchmark Datasets:**\n  - Evaluate the integrated model on standard benchmark datasets such as the WikiText-103, BookCorpus, or other long-sequence datasets to assess its performance in terms of perplexity, accuracy, and robustness.\n  - Compare the performance against state-of-the-art models to validate the improvements.\n\n- **Ablation Studies:**\n  - Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component (DCA and FIRE) to the overall performance of the model. This will help in fine-tuning the architecture and identifying any potential bottlenecks.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can ensure a comprehensive and well-optimized integration of DCA and FIRE into RetNet, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability for autoregressive language models.\n",

Retentive network: a successor to transformer for large language models (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Shuming Ma, Yuqing Xia, Jilong Xue, Jianyong Wang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 143  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance, and proposes the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/74 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4 layer to a special case where the state dimension is $N=1$. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be viewed as a special case of a linear SSM. Its primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large head dimension, which can be viewed as another method to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context of linear attention variants was first done by H 3 , but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation. RetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case of SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\n```\n\n#### 3. Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions Improves Long Context Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Shanda Li, Chong You, Guru Guruganesh, J. Ainslie, Santiago Ontanon, M. Zaheer, Sumit K. Sanghai, Yiming Yang, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple, and empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Preventing the performance decay of Transformers on inputs longer than those used for training has been an important challenge in extending the context length of these models. Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/43 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nThe reported results are averaged over 10 runs for each method. Model quality. Table 2 compares the accuracy of FIRE-S and the standard FIRE. The results show that sharing position encoding function across layers only leads to a slight performance degradation. FIRE-S still outperforms other baselines in the long sequence regime. For example, on C4 language modeling with sequence length 8192, it outperforms Kerple, the best baseline in Fig. 1 ( 3.10 v.s. $3.16 \\log$ perplexity). On SCROLLS, its average score outperforms all the strong baseline methods including T5's RPE, RoPE with positional interpolation, and Kerple.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/43 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n4. More recently, Zhou et al. (2024) show that standard Transformers can generalize to a sequence length that is $2.5 \\times$ the training input length on integer addition using FIRE (and other techniques (Ruoss et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023)). Positional encoding in Transformers. Positional encoding is a critical component of Transformers. Vaswani et al. (2017) propose sinusoidal Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) to encode positional information in the sequential input. Shaw et al. (2018) are the first to propose Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) for Transformers, and many follow-up works explore different RPE strategies (Dai et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019). There are also many works that study positional encoding from different perspectives, including the disentanglement of positional and content information (Kitaev \\& Klein, 2018; Ke et al., 2021), the representational power of attention modules and Transformers (Cordonnier et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022), computational efficiency (Su et al., 2021; Liutkus et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2023), and length generalization (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). Our work is based on a unified formulation of existing additive relative positional encoding approaches, and proposes new RPE variant aimed at improving length generalization. Interpolation techniques in deep learning. Interpolation techniques are successfully applied to many deep learning applications, especially in computer vision. Long et al. (2015) employ bilinear interpolation in up-sampling layers of convolutional neural networks for dense visual prediction. Dong et al. (2015); Johnson et al. (2016) employ bicubic interpolation for image super-resolution. Radford et al. (2015) probe generative models by interpolation in the latent space. Zhang et al. (2018); Han et al. (2022) use interpolating between pairs of examples and their labels as an data augmentation method. Recently, Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) propose to perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained APE for Vision Transformer to apply the model to higher resolution images. In contrast, our interpretation is applied in the relative position encoding functions. Besides, we are focused on causal attention setting where \"global\" information such as the total sequence length is unknown, while Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) work on encoder-only Transformers with fixed input lengths. ## E IMPLEMENTATION\n\nIn this section, we present the implementation of our proposed FIRE module in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019). ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nclass FIRE(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_heads=12, mlp_width=32, init_c=0.1,\n        init_L=512., eps=1e-6):\n    \" \" \"\n    FIRE attention bias module.

Associative Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg.

Our approach, Associative Recurrent Memory Transformer (ARMT), is based on transformer self-attention for local context and segment-level recurrence for storage of task specific information distributed over a long context. We demonstrate that ARMT outperfors existing alternatives in associative retrieval tasks and sets a new performance record in the recent BABILong multi-task long-context benchmark by answering single-fact questions over 50 million tokens with an accuracy of 79.9%.

Limitations\n\nThe proposed architecture, however, has several drawbacks. The first is the lack of efficient parallel implementation: you have to process all segments consecutively. This doesn't mean that it is slow. It's fast enough to process millions of tokens in a reasonable time. However, on short and medium-length sequences (less than 300k tokens), it is much slower than, for instance, Mamba and RWKV, which have the parallel form. Moreover, as we have shown in Appendix G, it's still challenging to train ARMT to solve the language modeling task well. However, we believe that this problem is not in the very architecture, but in training process: we observe that ARMT tends to keep in memory only the last segment, and therefore struggles to extrapolate on longer sequences.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet integration*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, we propose $\\mathbf{BioT5}$, a comprehensive pre-training framework that enriches cross-modal integration in biology with chemical knowledge and natural language associations. $\\mathbf{BioT5}$ utilizes SELFIES for $100%$ robust molecular representations and extracts knowledge from the surrounding context of bio-entities in unstructured biological literature. Furthermore, $\\mathbf{BioT5}$ distinguishes between structured and unstructured knowledge, leading to more effective utilization of information.

In this paper, we present a method to fine-tune open-source language models, enabling them to use code for modeling and deriving math equations and, consequently, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities. We propose a method of generating novel and high-quality datasets with math problems and their code-based solutions, referred to as MathCodeInstruct. Each solution interleaves natural language, code, and execution results. We also introduce a customized supervised fine-tuning and inference approach. This approach yields the MathCoder models, a family of models capable of generating code-based solutions for solving challenging math problems.

Stochastic DCA for the Large-sum of Non-convex Functions Problem and its Application to Group Variable Selection in Classification\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Hoai An Le Thi, L.

We consider the `2,0 regularization to deal with the group variables selection. By exploiting the special structure of the problem, we propose an efficient DC decomposition for which the corresponding stochastic DCA scheme is very inexpensive: it only requires the projection of points onto balls that is explicitly computed. As an application, we applied our algorithm for the group variables selection in multiclass logistic regression. Numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets and synthetic datasets illustrate the efficiency of our algorithm and its superiority over well-known methods, with respect to classification accuracy, sparsity of solution as well as running time.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Training-Free Long-Context Scaling of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Chen An, Fei Huang, Jun Zhang, Shansan Gong, Xipeng Qiu, Chang Zhou, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) is proposed, which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training, and achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models.\n\n**Abstract:** The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate coherent text is markedly weakened when the number of input tokens exceeds their pretraining length. Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

Difference of Submodular Minimization via DC Programming\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Marwa El Halabi, George Orfanides, Tim Hoheisel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Variants of DCA and its complete form are introduced that are applied to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization, and a stronger local minimality guarantee is obtained in the case of CDCA.\n\n**Abstract:** Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem. Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications: speech corpus selection and feature selection.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

To combat this emerging risk of LLMs, we propose a novel\"Fighting Fire with Fire\"(F3) strategy that harnesses modern LLMs' generative and emergent reasoning capabilities to counter human-written and LLM-generated disinformation. First, we leverage GPT-3.5-turbo to synthesize authentic and deceptive LLM-generated content through paraphrase-based and perturbation-based prefix-style prompts, respectively. Second, we apply zero-shot in-context semantic reasoning techniques with cloze-style prompts to discern genuine from deceptive posts and news articles. In our extensive experiments, we observe GPT-3.5-turbo's zero-shot superiority for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, where GPT-3.5-turbo consistently achieved accuracy at 68-72%, unlike the decline observed in previous customized and fine-tuned disinformation detectors.

GLIF: A Unified Gated Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: FIRE*\n\n*Xing-Hua Yao, Fanrong Li, Zitao Mo, Jianguo Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio- features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons and increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiker neurons.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been studied over decades to incorporate their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency. Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF, gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

Learning Dynamic Context Augmentation for Global Entity Linking\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Xiyuan Yang, Xiaotao Gu, Sheng Lin, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang, Fei Wu, Zhigang Chen, Guoping Hu, Xiang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite of the recent success of collective entity linking (EL) methods,\nthese \"global\" inference methods may yield sub-optimal results when the\n\"all-mention coherence\" assumption breaks, and often suffer from high\ncomputational cost at the inference stage, due to the complex search space. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution, called Dynamic Context\nAugmentation (DCA), for collective EL, which requires only one pass through the\nmentions in a document. DCA sequentially accumulates context information to\nmake efficient, collective inference, and can cope with different local EL\nmodels as a plug-and-enhance module. We explore both supervised and\nreinforcement learning strategies for learning the DCA model.

A major challenge in this task is how to properly leverage\nthe rich and diverse information carried by video and text.

Our model builds bidirectional interactions between\nvideo frames and surrounding comments from multiple perspectives via metric\nlearning, to collect a diversified and informative context for comment\ngeneration. We also propose an effective parameter orthogonalization technique\nto avoid excessive overlap of information learned from different perspectives.\nResults show that our approach outperforms existing methods in the ALVC task,\nachieving new state-of-the-art results.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-07T03:28:38Z  (*Updated: 2020-08-08T13:37:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

RMT: Retentive Networks Meet Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet integration*\n\n*Ran He, Hongmin Liu, Mingrui Chen, Huaibo Huang, Qihang Fan*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained increasing attention in the computer vision community in recent years. However, the core component of ViT, Self-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic computational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To alleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on ImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**. For downstream tasks, RMT achieves **54.5** box AP and **47.2** mask AP on the COCO detection task, and **52.8** mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task.

DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet integration*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Tianyu Guo, Yujie Yang, Chengcheng Wang, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, wei he*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Deep Covariance Alignment for Domain Adaptive Remote Sensing Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Leyuan Fang, Ming Lu, Linshan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) image segmentation has recently gained increasing attention, aiming to improve the generalization capability for transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, in high spatial resolution remote sensing image (RSI), the same category from different domains (\\emph{e.g.}, urban and rural) can appear to be totally different with extremely inconsistent distributions, which heavily limits the UDA accuracy. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Covariance Alignment (DCA) model for UDA RSI segmentation. The DCA can explicitly align category features to learn shared domain-invariant discriminative feature representations, which enhances the ability of model generalization. Specifically, a Category Feature Pooling (CFP) module is first employed to extract category features by combining the coarse outputs and the deep features. Then, we leverage a novel Covariance Regularization (CR) to enforce the intra-category features to be closer and the inter-category features to be further separate. Compared with the existing category alignment methods, our CR aims to regularize the correlation between different dimensions of the features and thus performs more robustly when dealing with the divergent category features of imbalanced and inconsistent distributions. Finally, we propose a stagewise procedure to train the DCA in order to alleviate the error accumulation. Experiments on both Rural-to-Urban and Urban-to-Rural scenarios of the LoveDA dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DCA over other state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods.

A Speaker Verification Backend with Robust Performance across Conditions\n\n*From Search Query: DCA*\n\n*Niko Brummer, Mitchell McLaren, Luciana Ferrer*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address the problem of speaker verification in conditions unseen or unknown during development. A standard method for speaker verification consists of extracting speaker embeddings with a deep neural network and processing them through a backend composed of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) and global logistic regression score calibration. This method is known to result in systems that work poorly on conditions different from those used to train the calibration model. We propose to modify the standard backend, introducing an adaptive calibrator that uses duration and other automatically extracted side-information to adapt to the conditions of the inputs. The backend is trained discriminatively to optimize binary cross-entropy. When trained on a number of diverse datasets that are labeled only with respect to speaker, the proposed backend consistently and, in some cases, dramatically improves calibration, compared to the standard PLDA approach, on a number of held-out datasets, some of which are markedly different from the training data. Discrimination performance is also consistently improved. We show that joint training of the PLDA and the adaptive calibrator is essential -- the same benefits cannot be achieved when freezing PLDA and fine-tuning the calibrator. To our knowledge, the results in this paper are the first evidence in the literature that it is possible to develop a speaker verification system with robust out-of-the-box performance on a large variety of conditions.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-02\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Our method builds upon the idea of convolutional part\nheatmap regression [1], extending it for 3D face alignment.

At the first stage, our method estimates the X,Y\ncoordinates of the facial landmarks by producing a set of 2D heatmaps, one for\neach landmark, using convolutional part heatmap regression. Then, these\nheatmaps, alongside the input RGB image, are used as input to a very deep\nsubnetwork trained via residual learning for regressing the Z coordinate.

FireNet: A Specialized Lightweight Fire & Smoke Detection Model for Real-Time IoT Applications\n\n*From Search Query: FIRE*\n\n*Mohd. Omama, Arpit Jadon, Akshay Varshney, Rishabh Sharma, Mohammad Samar Ansari*\n\n**Abstract:** Fire disasters typically result in lot of loss to life and property. It is therefore imperative that precise, fast, and possibly portable solutions to detect fire be made readily available to the masses at reasonable prices. There have been several research attempts to design effective and appropriately priced fire detection systems with varying degrees of success. However, most of them demonstrate a trade-off between performance and model size (which decides the model's ability to be installed on portable devices). The work presented in this paper is an attempt to deal with both the performance and model size issues in one design. Toward that end, a `designed-from-scratch' neural network, named FireNet, is proposed which is worthy on both the counts: (i) it has better performance than existing counterparts, and (ii) it is lightweight enough to be deploy-able on embedded platforms like Raspberry Pi. Performance evaluations on a standard dataset, as well as our own newly introduced custom-compiled fire dataset, are extremely encouraging.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the challenges and limitations of integrating Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) and Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE) into RetNet, here are some key areas and potential sources of information that can help the researchers:\n\n### Computational Complexity and Memory Management\n\n1. **Optimization Techniques:**\n   - Investigate optimization methods that can reduce the computational overhead of integrating DCA and FIRE.

However, their performance often diminishes when processing sequences longer than those encountered during training. This limitation hinders applications requiring long-context understanding, such as processing lengthy documents, maintaining extended dialogue history, and enabling interactive chatbots with long-term coherence.\n\nRetentive Network (RetNet) provides an efficient architecture for language modeling, combining training parallelism with low-cost inference. Nevertheless, its ability to handle very long sequences is constrained by memory and computational efficiency. Enhancing RetNet to process longer contexts without retraining and without sacrificing performance is crucial for advancing its applicability in real-world tasks involving long sequences.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Retentive Network (RetNet)\n\nRetNet [Sun et al., 2023] introduces the retention mechanism, supporting parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent computation paradigms. It achieves efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity, making it suitable for language modeling tasks.\n\n### Dual Chunk Attention (DCA)\n\nAn et al. (2023) proposed Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), enabling LLMs to support extended context windows without additional training. DCA decomposes attention computation into chunk-based modules, effectively capturing intra-chunk and inter-chunk positional information, thereby enhancing context length generalization.\n\n### Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE)\n\nLi et al. (2023) introduced FIRE, a novel positional encoding method that improves Transformer generalization to longer contexts through progressive interpolation of relative positions. FIRE has been shown to enhance length extrapolation capabilities in Transformers.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Limitations of RetNet in Long-Sequence Processing\n\nWhile RetNet's chunkwise recurrent representation allows efficient long-sequence modeling, its ability to handle contexts significantly longer than the training sequence length remains limited. As sequence length increases, memory usage and computational cost grow, potentially degrading performance due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms.\n\n### Benefits of Dual Chunk Attention\n\nIntegrating DCA into RetNet can address these limitations by:\n\n- **Extending Context Length**: DCA enables models to process sequences much longer than the pretraining context length without additional training.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: By processing chunks independently and efficiently summarizing inter-chunk information, memory usage is optimized.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Decomposing attention into intra-chunk and inter-chunk modules reduces computational overhead.\n\n### Enhancing Positional Encoding with FIRE\n\nIncorporating FIRE into RetNet's positional encoding can improve length generalization by:\n\n- **Dynamic Position Representation**: FIRE provides functional interpolation for relative positions, enabling models to generalize to unseen sequence lengths.\n- **Compatibility**: FIRE can represent popular relative positional encodings, making it suitable for integration with RetNet's architecture.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n```selection RetNet```\n\n### Overview\n\nWe propose to modify the **RetNet GAU** by integrating **Dual Chunk Attention (DCA)** and incorporating **Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE)** into its positional encoding mechanism. This design aims to enhance RetNet's ability to handle longer sequences efficiently while maintaining or improving performance.\n\n### Modifications to RetNet GAU\n\n1. **Integrate Dual Chunk Attention (DCA)**:\n\n   - **Chunk Splitting**: Divide the input sequence into chunks of length \\( L_c \\).\n   - **Intra-Chunk Processing**: Apply RetNet's existing attention mechanism within each chunk.\n   - **Inter-Chunk Attention**: Introduce an inter-chunk attention module to capture dependencies across chunks.\n\n2. **Incorporate FIRE Positional Encoding**:\n\n   - Replace or augment RetNet's positional encoding with FIRE's functional relative position encoding.\n   - Adjust attention computations to use the FIRE-based positional biases.\n\n### Detailed Descriptions\n\n#### 1.

Replace the existing RetNet GAU with the `ChunkedRetNet` class in the model code.\n\n2. **Initialize Chunk Parameters**:\n\n   - Choose an appropriate `chunk_size`, e.g., 1024 tokens.\n   - Set the number of basis functions `num_basis` for FIRE positional encoding.\n\n3. **Adjust Positional Encoding**:\n\n   - Implement the `compute_positional_bias` method using FIRE.\n   - Initialize basis function parameters (`self.basis_functions`, `self.weights`) appropriately.\n\n4. **Update Forward Pass**:\n\n   - In the `_forward` method, process inputs chunk by chunk.\n   - Compute intra-chunk and inter-chunk attention as described.\n   - Ensure that the previous keys and values are cached for inter-chunk attention.\n\n5. **Memory Management**:\n\n   - Monitor memory usage to ensure that the caching of previous keys and values does not exceed available memory.\n   - Implement mechanisms to truncate or summarize past keys and values if necessary.\n\n6. **Training and Inference**:\n\n   - During training, ensure that the model can handle sequences up to the pretraining length.\n   - At inference time, leverage the chunked processing to handle longer sequences without retraining.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating Dual Chunk Attention and Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions into the RetNet GAU, **ChunkedRetNet** extends the model's capability to process significantly longer sequences efficiently. The chunk-based attention mechanism allows for scalable handling of long contexts without additional training, while the advanced positional encoding enhances the model's length generalization. This design maintains RetNet's advantages of training parallelism and low-cost inference, making it better suited for real-world applications that require long-context understanding.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Sun, Y., Dong, L., Huang, S., Ma, S., Xia, Y., Xue, J., Wang, J., & Wei, F.
