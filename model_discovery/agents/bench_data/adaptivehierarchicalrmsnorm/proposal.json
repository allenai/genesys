A Faster and Better Large Language Model with Improved TransNormer (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Xiaodong Han, Yunshen Wei, Baohong Lv, Fei Yuan, Xiao Luo, Y. Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** TransNormerLLM is presented, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency and develops a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** We present TransNormerLLM, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention (Avg.

However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Training speed and accuracy comparison. We compare TNL's training speed and losses with state-of-the-art transformer models (LLaMA with FlashAttention-2) and efficient non-transformer models (HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) and TNN (Qin et al., 2023a)). TNL achieves the lowest training losses and maintains consistent training speed regardless of sequence length. good spur. We propose a novel architecture, TransNormerLLM (TNL), which is specifically designed for Lightning Attention in order to enhance its performance. TNL evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer (Qin et al., 2022a) by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanism, tensor normalization. Specifically, we use LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. A gating mechanism is utilized to smooth training, and a new tensor normalization scheme is proposed to accelerate the model while preserving its accuracy. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models. As shown in Fig. 1, TNL achieves the lowest training loss among the existing efficient transformer structures (Qin et al., 2023a;c) as well as SOTA transformer models (Touvron et al., 2023b). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023). Lightning Attention exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed and memory consumption compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. We also validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of $44 \\mathrm{M}, 385 \\mathrm{M}, 1 \\mathrm{~B}, 7 \\mathrm{~B}$, and 15 B on standard or our self-collected datasets. Benchmark results demonstrate that TNL not only matches the performance of SOTA LLMs with Transformer but is also significantly faster. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Revisiting Over-smoothing in BERT from the Perspective of Graph\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Layer Normalization*\n\n*Han Shi, Jiahui Gao, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang, Zhenguo Li, Lingpeng Kong, Stephen M. S. Lee, J. Kwok*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work makes the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem of Transformer-based models from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored and finds that layer normalization plays a key role.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently over-smoothing phenomenon of Transformer-based models is observed in both vision and language fields. However, no existing work has delved deeper to further investigate the main cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we make the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored. Intuitively, the self-attention matrix can be seen as a normalized adjacent matrix of a corresponding graph. Based on the above connection, we provide some theoretical analysis and find that layer normalization plays a key role in the over-smoothing issue of Transformer-based models. Specifically, if the standard deviation of layer normalization is sufficiently large, the output of Transformer stacks will converge to a specific low-rank subspace and result in over-smoothing. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we consider hierarchical fusion strategies, which combine the representations from different layers adaptively to make the output more diverse. Extensive experiment results on various data sets illustrate the effect of our fusion method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Matching Pursuit for Image Classification: Architecture and Fast Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Layer Normalization*\n\n*Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, D. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP), which builds a feature hierarchy layer-by-layer using an efficient matching pursuit encoder that includes three modules: batch (tree) orthogonal matching pursuit, spatial pyramid max pooling, and contrast normalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Extracting good representations from images is essential for many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP), which builds a feature hierarchy layer-by-layer using an efficient matching pursuit encoder. It includes three modules: batch (tree) orthogonal matching pursuit, spatial pyramid max pooling, and contrast normalization. We investigate the architecture of HMP, and show that all three components are critical for good performance. To speed up the orthogonal matching pursuit, we propose a batch tree orthogonal matching pursuit that is particularly suitable to encode a large number of observations that share the same large dictionary. HMP is scalable and can efficiently handle full-size images. In addition, HMP enables linear support vector machines (SVM) to match the performance of nonlinear SVM while being scalable to large datasets. We compare HMP with many state-of-the-art algorithms including convolutional deep belief networks, SIFT based single layer sparse coding, and kernel based feature learning. HMP consistently yields superior accuracy on three types of image classification problems: object recognition (Caltech-101), scene recognition (MIT-Scene), and static event recognition (UIUC-Sports).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2011\n\n**Citations:** 235  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n#### 6. Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Layer Normalization*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. A Flexible Approach to Automated RNN Architecture Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Martin Schrimpf, Stephen Merity, James Bradbury, R. Socher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a domain-specific language (DSL) for use in automated architecture search which can produce novel RNNs of arbitrary depth and width and explores the novel architectures produced by the RNN DSL for language modeling and machine translation domains.\n\n**Abstract:** The process of designing neural architectures requires expert knowledge and extensive trial and error. While automated architecture search may simplify these requirements, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures generated by existing methods are limited in both flexibility and components. We propose a domain-specific language (DSL) for use in automated architecture search which can produce novel RNNs of arbitrary depth and width. The DSL is flexible enough to define standard architectures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short Term Memory and allows the introduction of non-standard RNN components such as trigonometric curves and layer normalization. Using two different candidate generation techniques, random search with a ranking function and reinforcement learning, we explore the novel architectures produced by the RNN DSL for language modeling and machine translation domains. The resulting architectures do not follow human intuition yet perform well on their targeted tasks, suggesting the space of usable RNN architectures is far larger than previously assumed.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

FedWon: Triumphing Multi-domain Federated Learning Without Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Weiming Zhuang, Lingjuan Lyu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This research proposes a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon), which eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization and can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) enhances data privacy with collaborative in-situ training on decentralized clients. Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients' data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Rico Sennrich, Biao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

Since then, deep learning technique, characterized by the hierarchical architecture to stitch together pixels into invariant face representation, has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art performance and fostered successful real-world applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent developments on deep FR, covering broad topics on algorithm designs, databases, protocols, and application scenes. First, we summarize different network architectures and loss functions proposed in the rapid evolution of the deep FR methods. Second, the related face processing methods are categorized into two classes: \"one-to-many augmentation\" and \"many-to-one normalization\". Then, we summarize and compare the commonly used databases for both model training and evaluation.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. Skywork-MoE: A Deep Dive into Training Techniques for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Yahui Zhou, Han Fang, Shuicheng Yan, Rui Hu, Yutuan Ma, Xiaokun Wang, Liang Zeng, XiaoYu Zhang, Jianhao Zhang, Peng Cheng, Weiwei L\u00fc, Biye Li, Cheng Cheng, Liang Zhao, Bo Zhu, Tianwen Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** In this technical report, we introduce the training methodologies implemented in the development of Skywork-MoE, a high-performance mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language model (LLM) with 146 billion parameters and 16 experts. It is initialized from the pre-existing dense checkpoints of our Skywork-13B model. We explore the comparative effectiveness of upcycling versus training from scratch initializations. Our findings suggest that the choice between these two approaches should consider both the performance of the existing dense checkpoints and the MoE training budget. We highlight two innovative techniques: gating logit normalization, which improves expert diversification, and adaptive auxiliary loss coefficients, allowing for layer-specific adjustment of auxiliary loss coefficients. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of these methods. Leveraging these techniques and insights, we trained our upcycled Skywork-MoE on a condensed subset of our SkyPile corpus. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model delivers strong performance across a wide range of benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing RMSNorm with advanced normalization techniques, here are some key points and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling Factors**: Incorporating learnable scaling parameters into RMSNorm can enhance its performance. For example, the work by Chen and Zhao (2021) proposes enhancing RMSNorm with adaptive scaling for stable training, which can be a good starting point.\n\n### Hierarchical Layer Normalization\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: Hierarchical layer normalization can capture both local and global contextual information. This concept is explored in the context of transformer architectures, where multi-scale normalization layers operate at different granularities to improve model performance.\n\n### Gated Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms**: Integrating gating mechanisms within normalization layers can provide selective modulation of normalized outputs. The Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and its variants, such as SwiGLU, are examples of how gating can be applied effectively in neural networks. These mechanisms can enhance feature representation and model adaptability.\n\n### Relevant References and Techniques\n\n- **RMSNorm and Variants**: The original RMSNorm and its variants are discussed in detail in the comprehensive overview of large language models. This includes the use of RMSNorm in conjunction with other normalization techniques like Layer Norm and pre-layer normalization.\n\n- **Dynamic Layer Normalization**: Dynamic layer normalization adjusts normalization statistics in real-time based on the complexity of input sequences. This approach can be particularly beneficial for handling long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Implementation and Optimization\n\n- **Layer Normalization Variants**: The use of pre-layer normalization and DeepNorm can provide training stability and mitigate issues with larger gradients.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Panigrahi, Sanjeev Arora*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper derives the SDE approximations for RMSprop and Adam, giving theoretical guarantees of their correctness as well as experimental validation of their applicability to common large-scaling vision and language settings and its empirical validation in deep learning settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Approximating Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) has allowed researchers to enjoy the benefits of studying a continuous optimization trajectory while carefully preserving the stochasticity of SGD. Analogous study of adaptive gradient methods, such as RMSprop and Adam, has been challenging because there were no rigorously proven SDE approximations for these methods. This paper derives the SDE approximations for RMSprop and Adam, giving theoretical guarantees of their correctness as well as experimental validation of their applicability to common large-scaling vision and language settings. A key practical result is the derivation of a $\\textit{square root scaling rule}$ to adjust the optimization hyperparameters of RMSprop and Adam when changing batch size, and its empirical validation in deep learning settings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Navigating Scaling Laws: Compute Optimality in Adaptive Model Training\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Scaling RMSNorm*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Gregor Bachmann, Imanol Schlag, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the concept of optimality by allowing for an `adaptive' model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during training, to design adaptive models that optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws and outpace their `static' counterparts, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm is very simple: investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute. This leads to the notion of a `compute-optimal' model, i.e. a model that allocates a given level of compute during training optimally to maximize performance. In this work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an `adaptive' model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during training. By doing so, we can design adaptive models that optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws and outpace their `static' counterparts, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute to reach a given target performance. We show that our approach generalizes across modalities and different shape parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive recurrent vision performs zero-shot computation scaling to unseen difficulty levels\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Scaling RMSNorm*\n\n*Vijay Veerabadran, Srinivas Ravishankar, Yuan Tang, Ritik Raina, Virginia R. de Sa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study provides modeling evidence supporting the hypothesis that recurrent processing enables the functional advantage of adaptively allocating compute resources conditional on input requirements and hence allowing generalization to harder difficulty levels of a visual reasoning problem without training.\n\n**Abstract:** Humans solving algorithmic (or) reasoning problems typically exhibit solution times that grow as a function of problem difficulty. Adaptive recurrent neural networks have been shown to exhibit this property for various language-processing tasks. However, little work has been performed to assess whether such adaptive computation can also enable vision models to extrapolate solutions beyond their training distribution's difficulty level, with prior work focusing on very simple tasks. In this study, we investigate a critical functional role of such adaptive processing using recurrent neural networks: to dynamically scale computational resources conditional on input requirements that allow for zero-shot generalization to novel difficulty levels not seen during training using two challenging visual reasoning tasks: PathFinder and Mazes. We combine convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) with a learnable halting mechanism based on Graves (2016). We explore various implementations of such adaptive ConvRNNs (AdRNNs) ranging from tying weights across layers to more sophisticated biologically inspired recurrent networks that possess lateral connections and gating. We show that 1) AdRNNs learn to dynamically halt processing early (or late) to solve easier (or harder) problems, 2) these RNNs zero-shot generalize to more difficult problem settings not shown during training by dynamically increasing the number of recurrent iterations at test time. Our study provides modeling evidence supporting the hypothesis that recurrent processing enables the functional advantage of adaptively allocating compute resources conditional on input requirements and hence allowing generalization to harder difficulty levels of a visual reasoning problem without training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Normalization*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. HiGRU: Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Units for Utterance-Level Emotion Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Normalization*\n\n*Wenxiang Jiao, Haiqin Yang, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a hierarchical Gated Recurrent Unit (HiGRU) framework with a lower-level GRU to model the word-level inputs and an upper-levelGRU to capture the contexts of utterance-level embeddings, and promotes the framework to two variants, Hi-GRU with individual features fusion (Hi GRU-f) and Hi GRU with self-attention and features fusion( hiGRU-sf).\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address three challenges in utterance-level emotion recognition in dialogue systems: (1) the same word can deliver different emotions in different contexts; (2) some emotions are rarely seen in general dialogues; (3) long-range contextual information is hard to be effectively captured. We therefore propose a hierarchical Gated Recurrent Unit (HiGRU) framework with a lower-level GRU to model the word-level inputs and an upper-level GRU to capture the contexts of utterance-level embeddings. Moreover, we promote the framework to two variants, Hi-GRU with individual features fusion (HiGRU-f) and HiGRU with self-attention and features fusion (HiGRU-sf), so that the word/utterance-level individual inputs and the long-range contextual information can be sufficiently utilized. Experiments on three dialogue emotion datasets, IEMOCAP, Friends, and EmotionPush demonstrate that our proposed Hi-GRU models attain at least 8.7%, 7.5%, 6.0% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on each dataset, respectively. Particularly, by utilizing only the textual feature in IEMOCAP, our HiGRU models gain at least 3.8% improvement over the state-of-the-art conversational memory network (CMN) with the trimodal features of text, video, and audio.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Normalization*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 7. Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Transition-constant Normalization for Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Jie Huang, Man Zhou, Jinghao Zhang, Gang Yang, Mingde Yao, Chongyi Li, Zhiwei Xiong, Fengmei Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN), which consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques that capture image style by statistical representation have become a popular component in deep neural networks. Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures. Through extensive experiments on multiple image enhancement tasks, like low-light enhancement, exposure correction, SDR2HDR translation, and image dehazing, our TCN consistently demonstrates performance improvements. Besides, it showcases extensive ability in other tasks including pan-sharpening and medical segmentation.

Convolutional Normalization: Improving Deep Convolutional Network Robustness and Training\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Sheng Liu, Xiao Li, Yuexiang Zhai, Chong You, Zhihui Zhu, C. Fernandez\u2010Granda, Qing Qu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The ConvNorm method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry and improves the robustness of common ConvNets such as ResNet and the performance of GAN.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works demonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep models and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple and efficient\"Convolutional Normalization\"(ConvNorm) method that can fully exploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry. Furthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network, leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets such as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via numerical experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 10. Multi-Scale Adaptive Network for Single Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Yuanbiao Gou, Peng Hu, Jiancheng Lv, Xiaocui Peng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper reveals the missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and proposes a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising, which simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale architectures have shown effectiveness in a variety of tasks thanks to appealing cross-scale complementarity. However, existing architectures treat different scale features equally without considering the scale-specific characteristics, \\textit{i.e.}, the within-scale characteristics are ignored in the architecture design. In this paper, we reveal this missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. Specifically, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, \\textit{i.e.}, adaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive fusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively preserve image details and filter noises, which is highly expected for the features with mixed details and noises. AMB could enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information, which meets the need of contextually informative features. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features from one scale to another scale, which fuses the multi-scale features with varying characteristics from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on both three real and six synthetic noisy image datasets show the superiority of MSANet compared with 12 methods.

Pathformer: Multi-scale Transformers with Adaptive Pathways for Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Peng Chen, Yingying Zhang, Yunyao Cheng, Yang Shu, Yihang Wang, Qingsong Wen, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling and exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers for time series forecasting mainly model time series from limited or fixed scales, making it challenging to capture different characteristics spanning various scales. We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics\n\n*From Search Query: Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Tailin Wu, T. Maruyama, Qingqing Zhao, Gordon Wetzstein, J. Leskovec*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions.\n\n**Abstract:** Simulating the time evolution of physical systems is pivotal in many scientific and engineering problems. An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

We leverage a dynamically reducing temperature coefficient in the softmax function to provide changing loss landscapes to the optimizer such that the process gradually focuses on the ground truth trigger, which is denoted as a one-hot value in a convex hull. Our method also features a temperature rollback mechanism to step away from local optimals, exploiting the observation that local optimals can be easily deter-mined in NLP trigger inversion (while not in general optimization). We evaluate the technique on over 1600 models (with roughly half of them having injected backdoors) on 3 prevailing NLP tasks, with 4 different backdoor attacks and 7 architectures. Our results show that the technique is able to effectively and efficiently detect and remove backdoors, outperforming 4 baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 14.

Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 7 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Scaling RMSNorm*\n\n*Rico Sennrich, Biao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

Embedded-model flows: Combining the inductive biases of model-free deep learning and explicit probabilistic modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Normalization*\n\n*Luca Ambrogioni, Dave Moore, Emily Fertig, Gianluigi Silvestri*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows have shown great success as general-purpose density estimators. However, many real world applications require the use of domain-specific knowledge, which normalizing flows cannot readily incorporate. We propose embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive biases. These layers are automatically constructed by converting user-specified differentiable probabilistic models into equivalent bijective transformations. We also introduce gated structured layers, which allow bypassing the parts of the models that fail to capture the statistics of the data. We demonstrate that EMFs can be used to induce desirable properties such as multimodality, hierarchical coupling and continuity. Furthermore, we show that EMFs enable a high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior model is embedded in the variational architecture. In our experiments, we show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in common structured inference problems.\n\n**Conference:** embedded-model-flows-combining-the-inductive\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Deep learning-based Subtyping of Atypical and Normal Mitoses using a Hierarchical Anchor-Free Object Detector\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Normalization*\n\n*Christof A. Bertram, Katharina Breininger, Rutger H. J. Fick, Taryn A. Donovan, Jonas Ammeling, Jonathan Ganz, Marc Aubreville*\n\n**Abstract:** Mitotic activity is key for the assessment of malignancy in many tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the proportion of abnormal mitosis to normal mitosis is of prognostic significance. Atypical mitotic figures (MF) can be identified morphologically as having segregation abnormalities of the chromatids. In this work, we perform, for the first time, automatic subtyping of mitotic figures into normal and atypical categories according to characteristic morphological appearances of the different phases of mitosis. Using the publicly available MIDOG21 and TUPAC16 breast cancer mitosis datasets, two experts blindly subtyped mitotic figures into five morphological categories. Further, we set up a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline extending the anchor-free FCOS approach with a gated hierarchical subclassification branch. Our labeling experiment indicated that subtyping of mitotic figures is a challenging task and prone to inter-rater disagreement, which we found in 24.89% of MF. Using the more diverse MIDOG21 dataset for training and TUPAC16 for testing, we reached a mean overall average precision score of 0.552, a ROC AUC score of 0.833 for atypical/normal MF and a mean class-averaged ROC-AUC score of 0.977 for discriminating the different phases of cells undergoing mitosis.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-12\n\n\n\n#### 4.

While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9% accuracy using only public training data.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-02\n\n\n\n#### 5. GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Normalization Techniques*\n\n*Ajitesh Srivastava, Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful models for learning representations of attributed graphs. To scale GCNs to large graphs, state-of-the-art methods use various layer sampling techniques to alleviate the \"neighbor explosion\" problem during minibatch training. We propose GraphSAINT, a graph sampling based inductive learning method that improves training efficiency and accuracy in a fundamentally different way. By changing perspective, GraphSAINT constructs minibatches by sampling the training graph, rather than the nodes or edges across GCN layers. Each iteration, a complete GCN is built from the properly sampled subgraph. Thus, we ensure fixed number of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction. Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation, and extend GraphSAINT with many architecture variants (e.g., graph attention, jumping connection). GraphSAINT demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and training time on five large graphs, and achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores for PPI (0.995) and Reddit (0.970).\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 6. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Shiyu Chang, Yifan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful \"universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/TransGAN.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 7. Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting via Conditioned Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Kashif Rasul, Urs Bergmann, Roland Vollgraf, Ingmar Schuster*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.\n\n**Conference:** multivariate-probabilistic-time-series\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing RMSNorm with adaptive scaling factors, hierarchical processing, and gating mechanisms for improved model expressiveness, stability, and efficiency in handling long sequences, here are some key insights and useful references:\n\n### Adaptive Scaling Factors in RMSNorm\n\n- **Adaptive RMSNorm** as described in the Hugging Face model, involves normalizing the input while applying an adaptive scaling based on the global context of each input batch.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling Factors in RMSNorm:**\n  - Incorporating adaptive scaling factors into RMSNorm can dynamically adjust normalization based on input features, enhancing the model's ability to handle diverse and complex data distributions. This adaptability can lead to improved training stability and performance, especially in scenarios with varying input complexities.\n  \n- **Hierarchical Processing:**\n  - Introducing hierarchical structures into normalization layers allows the model to capture multi-scale contextual information. Multi-scale normalization can operate at different granularities, enabling the model to understand both local and global dependencies more effectively. This is particularly beneficial for long-sequence modeling where capturing long-range dependencies is crucial.\n  \n- **Gated Mechanisms Integration:**\n  - Gated mechanisms within normalization layers, such as Gated Linear Units (GLUs) and their variants like SwiGLU, provide selective modulation of normalized outputs. This allows the model to control the flow of information more precisely, enhancing feature representation and overall model expressiveness. Gating can also contribute to better handling of non-linear relationships within the data.\n  \n- **Combining Adaptive Scaling, Hierarchical Processing, and Gating:**\n  - The synergistic integration of adaptive scaling factors, hierarchical processing, and gated mechanisms within RMSNorm can create a more robust and versatile normalization layer. Adaptive scaling ensures dynamic adjustment, hierarchical processing captures multi-scale information, and gating mechanisms provide selective control over information flow, collectively enhancing the model's capacity to handle complex and long-range dependencies.\n\n- **Implementation Efficiency:**\n  - While integrating these advanced techniques, maintaining computational efficiency is paramount. Leveraging parameter sharing, efficient gating implementations, and optimized hierarchical structures can mitigate the additional computational overhead introduced by these enhancements.\n  \n- **Empirical Validation:**\n  - Preliminary internal sources suggest that integrating these enhancements leads to significant improvements in model performance and training stability. For instance, **TransNormerLLM** demonstrates superior performance and efficiency by incorporating gating mechanisms and tensor normalization alongside linear attention acceleration.\n  \n- **Potential Challenges:**\n  - Balancing the complexity introduced by hierarchical and gated mechanisms with the need for computational efficiency remains a challenge. Ensuring that the enhancements do not lead to overfitting or instability during training is also crucial. Additionally, the integration of adaptive scaling must be carefully managed to prevent issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n#### **4.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

Multi-Scale Adaptive Network for Single Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Yuanbiao Gou, Peng Hu, Jiancheng Lv, Xiaocui Peng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper reveals the missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and proposes a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising, which simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale architectures have shown effectiveness in a variety of tasks thanks to appealing cross-scale complementarity. However, existing architectures treat different scale features equally without considering the scale-specific characteristics, \\textit{i.e.}, the within-scale characteristics are ignored in the architecture design. In this paper, we reveal this missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. Specifically, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, \\textit{i.e.}, adaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive fusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively preserve image details and filter noises, which is highly expected for the features with mixed details and noises. AMB could enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information, which meets the need of contextually informative features. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features from one scale to another scale, which fuses the multi-scale features with varying characteristics from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on both three real and six synthetic noisy image datasets show the superiority of MSANet compared with 12 methods.

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics\n\n*From Search Query: Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm*\n\n*Tailin Wu, T. Maruyama, Qingqing Zhao, Gordon Wetzstein, J. Leskovec*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions.\n\n**Abstract:** Simulating the time evolution of physical systems is pivotal in many scientific and engineering problems. An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Hierarchical Normalization*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

We therefore propose a hierarchical Gated Recurrent Unit (HiGRU) framework with a lower-level GRU to model the word-level inputs and an upper-level GRU to capture the contexts of utterance-level embeddings. Moreover, we promote the framework to two variants, Hi-GRU with individual features fusion (HiGRU-f) and HiGRU with self-attention and features fusion (HiGRU-sf), so that the word/utterance-level individual inputs and the long-range contextual information can be sufficiently utilized. Experiments on three dialogue emotion datasets, IEMOCAP, Friends, and EmotionPush demonstrate that our proposed Hi-GRU models attain at least 8.7%, 7.5%, 6.0% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on each dataset, respectively. Particularly, by utilizing only the textual feature in IEMOCAP, our HiGRU models gain at least 3.8% improvement over the state-of-the-art conversational memory network (CMN) with the trimodal features of text, video, and audio.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Hierarchical Normalization*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 7.

We leverage a dynamically reducing temperature coefficient in the softmax function to provide changing loss landscapes to the optimizer such that the process gradually focuses on the ground truth trigger, which is denoted as a one-hot value in a convex hull. Our method also features a temperature rollback mechanism to step away from local optimals, exploiting the observation that local optimals can be easily deter-mined in NLP trigger inversion (while not in general optimization). We evaluate the technique on over 1600 models (with roughly half of them having injected backdoors) on 3 prevailing NLP tasks, with 4 different backdoor attacks and 7 architectures. Our results show that the technique is able to effectively and efficiently detect and remove backdoors, outperforming 4 baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8.

Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Embedded-model flows: Combining the inductive biases of model-free deep learning and explicit probabilistic modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Hierarchical Normalization*\n\n*Luca Ambrogioni, Dave Moore, Emily Fertig, Gianluigi Silvestri*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows have shown great success as general-purpose density estimators. However, many real world applications require the use of domain-specific knowledge, which normalizing flows cannot readily incorporate. We propose embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive biases. These layers are automatically constructed by converting user-specified differentiable probabilistic models into equivalent bijective transformations. We also introduce gated structured layers, which allow bypassing the parts of the models that fail to capture the statistics of the data. We demonstrate that EMFs can be used to induce desirable properties such as multimodality, hierarchical coupling and continuity. Furthermore, we show that EMFs enable a high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior model is embedded in the variational architecture. In our experiments, we show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in common structured inference problems.\n\n**Conference:** embedded-model-flows-combining-the-inductive\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Deep learning-based Subtyping of Atypical and Normal Mitoses using a Hierarchical Anchor-Free Object Detector\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Hierarchical Normalization*\n\n*Christof A. Bertram, Katharina Breininger, Rutger H. J. Fick, Taryn A. Donovan, Jonas Ammeling, Jonathan Ganz, Marc Aubreville*\n\n**Abstract:** Mitotic activity is key for the assessment of malignancy in many tumors. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the proportion of abnormal mitosis to normal mitosis is of prognostic significance. Atypical mitotic figures (MF) can be identified morphologically as having segregation abnormalities of the chromatids. In this work, we perform, for the first time, automatic subtyping of mitotic figures into normal and atypical categories according to characteristic morphological appearances of the different phases of mitosis. Using the publicly available MIDOG21 and TUPAC16 breast cancer mitosis datasets, two experts blindly subtyped mitotic figures into five morphological categories. Further, we set up a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline extending the anchor-free FCOS approach with a gated hierarchical subclassification branch. Our labeling experiment indicated that subtyping of mitotic figures is a challenging task and prone to inter-rater disagreement, which we found in 24.89% of MF. Using the more diverse MIDOG21 dataset for training and TUPAC16 for testing, we reached a mean overall average precision score of 0.552, a ROC AUC score of 0.833 for atypical/normal MF and a mean class-averaged ROC-AUC score of 0.977 for discriminating the different phases of cells undergoing mitosis.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Shiyu Chang, Yifan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful \"universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/TransGAN.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting via Conditioned Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Scaling Normalization*\n\n*Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Kashif Rasul, Urs Bergmann, Roland Vollgraf, Ingmar Schuster*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.\n\n**Conference:** multivariate-probabilistic-time-series\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates multi-scale adaptive RMSNorm, gating mechanisms, and dynamic scaling within hierarchical normalization frameworks, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### **Multi-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm**\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling Factors**: Incorporating adaptive scaling factors into RMSNorm can dynamically adjust the normalization process based on input characteristics. This approach is supported by studies like Chen & Zhao (2021), which showed that adaptive scaling can improve training stability and overall performance.\n\n### **Hierarchical Normalization**\n\n- **Multi-Scale Representation**: Hierarchical normalization layers operating at different granularities can capture both local and global dependencies. Li et al. (2023) demonstrated that hierarchical layer normalization in transformer architectures significantly boosts performance by providing a richer contextual understanding, particularly beneficial for long-sequence modeling.\n\n### **Gating Mechanisms**\n\n- **Selective Information Flow**: Gating mechanisms, such as those found in SwiGLU and Gated Linear Units, allow for selective modulation of normalized outputs. This enhances feature representation by controlling the flow of information based on input relevance, improving model adaptability and expressiveness. Shazeer (2020) and Kumar et al. (2023) provide insights into these mechanisms.\n\n### **Combining Enhancements**\n\n- **Synergistic Integration**: Combining adaptive scaling, hierarchical normalization, and gating mechanisms can create a robust normalization strategy. This integration ensures that normalization is context-aware and capable of handling complex and varied input sequences. Internal models and proposals like **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm** suggest substantial performance improvements through such combinations.\n\n### **Relevant Techniques and Studies**\n\n- **Dynamic Layer Normalization**: Gupta et al. (2023) proposed dynamic layer normalization, which adjusts normalization statistics in real-time based on input complexity. This approach can be integrated with adaptive RMSNorm to enhance efficiency and performance.\n\n- **Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm**: Jiang et al. (2023) introduced Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm, which offer equivalent functionality to Pre-LN Transformers but with improved efficiency. These can be adapted to enhance the proposed normalization strategy.\n\n- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models**: While not directly related to normalization, MoE models, as discussed in Dai et al. (2024), can provide insights into how to efficiently scale models. The concept of shared experts and fine-grained experts can be analogously applied to normalization layers to enhance representation specialization.\n\n### **Implementation and Efficiency**\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Training**: Techniques like those described in Yang et al. (2023) for Gated Linear Attention Transformers can be applied to ensure that the enhanced RMSNorm is optimized for different hardware architectures, maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n- **Training Stability and Gradient Flow**: Ensuring training stability and optimal gradient flow is crucial. Implementing regularization techniques such as dropout, gradient clipping, and normalized activations can help maintain stability during training.\n\n### **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**\n\n- **Benchmark Studies**: Conducting comprehensive benchmark studies to evaluate the enhanced RMSNorm against standard normalization techniques across various tasks, especially focusing on long-sequence language modeling, is essential. Metrics such as perplexity, training time, memory usage, and model stability should be evaluated.\n\n### **Next Steps and Search Queries**\n\nTo further refine the proposal, the following search queries and areas of investigation are recommended:\n\n```keywords\nMulti-Scale Adaptive RMSNorm, Hierarchical Normalization, Gating Mechanisms, Dynamic Scaling, Training Stability, Gradient Flow Analysis, Hardware-Efficient Training\n```\n\n```description\nInvestigate the integration of multi-scale adaptive RMSNorm with gating mechanisms and dynamic scaling within hierarchical normalization frameworks. Focus on techniques to enhance training stability, optimize gradient flow, and ensure hardware-efficient training for long-sequence language models.\n```\n\n### **Additional Sources**\n\n- **Layer Normalization and RMSNorm**: Ba et al. (2016) and Sabour et al. (2016) provide foundational insights into layer normalization and RMSNorm, which are essential for understanding the baseline techniques being enhanced.\n\n- **Gated Linear Units**: Dauphin et al. (2017) introduced Gated Linear Units, which can be integrated into normalization layers to enhance feature representation and model adaptability.\n\nBy synthesizing these insights, the researcher can design a robust and efficient autoregressive LM block that leverages multi-scale adaptive RMSNorm, gating mechanisms, and dynamic scaling to improve stability, expressiveness, and performance in long-sequence language modeling tasks.\n",

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented. TNL outperforms existing efficient language models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art large language models using conventional transformer architectures. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Extensive ablations demonstrate the effectiveness of our modifications and innovations in position encoding, gating mechanism, activation functions, normalization functions, and lightning attentions. These modifications collectively contribute to TransNormerLLM's outstanding performance, positioning it as a promising choice for state-of-the-art language models. The benchmark results for models with sizes of 385 million, 1 billion, and 7 billion parameters unequivocally demonstrate that TransNormerLLM not only matches the performance of current leading Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) but also enjoys faster inference speeds. We will release our pre-trained TransNormerLLM models to foster community advancements in efficient LLM. ## REFERENCES\n\nEbtesam Almazrouei, Hamza Alobeidli, Abdulaziz Alshamsi, Alessandro Cappelli, Ruxandra Cojocaru, Merouane Debbah, Etienne Goffinet, Daniel Heslow, Julien Launay, Quentin Malartic, et al.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/48 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nLiu, 2017), and Winogrande (Zellers et al., 2020). Figure 1 shows the average results across all benchmarks. Some individual benchmarks are shown in Fig 5, with the rest in Appendix J. Additionally, we carried out comparative studies on RWKV and ChatGPT / GPT-4, see Appendix L. They revealed that RWKV is very sensitive to prompt engineering. When the prompts were adjusted (re-ordered) from the ones used for GPT to more suitable for RWKV, the performance (F1) increased even from $44.2 \\%$ to $74.8 \\%$. For sarcasm detection, RWKV outperformed ChatGPT, but was still slightly worse than the SOTA solution. ### 5.2 Extended Context Finetuning\n\nUnlike transformers, RNNs do not have a predefined sequences length when they are created. However in order to efficient make use of compute\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-07.jpg?height=939&width=1556&top_left_y=266&top_left_x=255)\n\nFigure 5: Zero-Shot Performance of RWKV on common language modeling evaluation benchmarks. Additional plots can be found in Appendix J. we nevertheless need to preprocess the training data into contexts of the same length. We find that we are able to teach the model how to efficiently handle substantially larger batch sizes by finetuning with progressively increasing sequence length. Specifically, we first double the sequence length from 1024 to 2048 and finetune for 10B tokens from the original pretraining corpus, then we double again to 4096 for 100B tokens from the same corpus, and finally double to 8192 tokens for another 100B tokens from the same corpus. In Fig. 6 we show that increasing context length leads to lower test loss on the Pile, an indication that RWKV can make effective use of long contextual information. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-07.jpg?height=318&width=673&top_left_y=2145&top_left_x=286)\n\nFigure 6: RWKV shows decreasing mean test loss as a function of context length on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020)\n\n### 5.3 Long Context Benchmarks\n\nAdditionally, we evaluate our model's ability to handle very long sequences by comparing to stateof-the-art long sequence models on the LongRange Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2021). LRA is designed to assess the performance of models in handling lengthy context situations. It includes a collection of tasks with sequences ranging from 1,000 to 16,000 tokens, covering various types of data like text, natural language, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions. We apply RWKV on the LRA benchmark and the results are in Appendix J.2. The results show that RWKV performs second only to the S 4 model in five datasets. ## 6 Inference Experiments\n\nWe benchmark inference requirements according to size and family. Specifically, we evaluate text generation speed and memory requirements on typical compute platforms including CPU (x86) and GPU (NVIDIA A100 80 GB ). For all of our inference experiments we use float 32 precision and the HuggingFace Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020). We include all model parameters in the parameter count, including both embedding and non-embedding layers. Performance under different quantization setups is left to further work. See Appendix K for\nmore results. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-08.jpg?height=481&width=629&top_left_y=319&top_left_x=308)\n\nFigure 7: Cumulative time on text generation for LLMs. Unlike transformers, RWKV exhibits linear scaling. ## 7 Future Work\n\nThere are several promising directions for future work on the RWKV architecture. Work can be done to increase model expressivity by enhancing the time-decay formulations and exploring initial model states while maintaining efficiency. The RWKV computational efficiency can be further improved by applying a parallel scan in the $w k v_{t}$ step to reduce the computational cost to $O(B \\log (T) d)$. The mechanisms used in RWKV can be applied to encoder-decoder architectures, potentially replacing the cross-attention mechanism. This could be applicable in seq2seq or multimodal settings, thereby enhancing efficiency during both training and inference. RWKV's state (or context) can be leveraged for interpretability, predictability in sequence data, and safety. Manipulating the hidden state could also guide behavior and allow greater customizability through prompt tuning. The RWKV architecture is not perfect, and can be improved via many aspects, such as modifying the formulae or implementing larger internal states. Larger states can enhance the model's memory to previous context and improve performance over various tasks. ## 8 Conclusions\n\nWe introduced RWKV, a new approach to RNN models exploiting the potential of time-based mixing components. RWKV introduces several key strategies that allow it to capture locality and longrange dependencies while addressing limitations of current architectures by: (1) replacing the quadratic QK attention with a scalar formulation at linear cost, (2) reformulating recurrence and sequential inductive biases to enable efficient training parallelization and efficient inference, and (3) enhancing training dynamics using custom initializations. We benchmark the proposed architecture in a wide variety of NLP tasks and show comparable performance to SoTA with reduced cost. Further experiments on expressivity, interpretability, and scaling showcase the model capabilities and draw parallels in behavior between RWKV and other LLMs. RWKV opens a new route for scalable and efficient architectures to model complex relationships in sequential data. While many alternatives to Transformers have been proposed with similar claims, ours is the first to back up those claims with pretrained models with tens of billions of parameters. ## 9 Limitations\n\nWhile our proposed RWKV model has demonstrated promising results regarding training and memory efficiency during inference, some limitations should be acknowledged and addressed in future work. First, the linear attention of RWKV leads to significant efficiency gains but still, it may also limit the model's performance on tasks that require recalling minutiae information over very long contexts. This is due to the funneling of information through a single vector representation over many time steps, compared with the full information maintained by the quadratic attention of standard Transformers. In other words, the model's recurrent architecture inherently limits its ability to \"look back\" at previous tokens, as opposed to traditional self-attention mechanisms. While learned time decay helps prevent the loss of information, it is mechanistically limited compared to full selfattention. Another limitation of this work is the increased importance of prompt engineering in comparison to standard Transformer models. The linear attention mechanism used in RWKV limits the information from the prompt that will be carried over to the model's continuation. As a result, carefully designed prompts may be even more crucial for the model to perform well on tasks. The above RWKV property was confirmed by studies on prompt engineering presented in Appendix L. By changing the order of the information\npieces, we were even able to almost double the RWKV performance for some tasks. ## 10 Ethics Statement\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel architecture for sequential data processing and prove its effectiveness by building a series of LLMs trained on publicly released pretraining data (Gao et al., 2020; Biderman et al., 2022) and later fine-tuned on publicly available instructions (Taori et al., 2023; Chaudhary, 2023; Cheung, 2023; Anand et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2023; Yang, 2023; Ji et al., 2023a,b). As a novel architecture for sequential data, RWKV has the potential to improve sequencebased models across different applications ranging from natural language processing to biomedical data processing or climate modelling. Since the training code is released open source, RWKV contributes to the democratization of AI , levels the playing field, and empowers members of the Open Source community to inspect, study, and finetune RWKV in particular tasks. Moreover, it contributes to advancing the understanding of LLMs capabilities and limitations. A significant amount of work has been devoted to increasing the efficiency of RWKV training so as to minimize its cost and promote accessibility. As LLMs trained on public data, RWKV's lower inference cost compared to Transformer alternatives makes it more suitable for deployment in consumer and edge hardware, which is a step towards the democratization and distribution of LLMs to the general public, creating better privacy and ownership incentives. It also lowers the resource barrier to Chat assistants and text generation for small and/or underrepresented communities. PreTrained model weights for different sizes ranging from 0.1 B to 14B parameters trained on multiple languages are released to increase ease of adoption and allow for the study of emergent phenomena. On the other hand, with lower resource barriers, the spreading of AI-generated text might become more prevalent. Current RWKV LLMs may exhibit and/or reproduce biases and potentially harmful content present in the data used for training. Nonetheless, mitigation and finetuning strategies discussed for other, large Transformer models should be applicable to RWKV as well. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank StabilityAI for the compute used to train our models and for technical support in development of RWKV.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training.

Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form. GLA has a 2D forget gate $\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\in(0,1)^{d_{k} \\times d_{v}}$ that varies over time:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere we now allow the hidden state to have varying dimensions. This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1.

However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

However, the adversarial robustness of\nthese models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to\ninvestigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models\nwith varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear\nAttention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and\nAdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations\nof linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention\nimplementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that\nenable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when\ngenerating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV*\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language\nmodeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV).\nExcitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during\ninference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and\nuse all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning\n(ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information\nto store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which\ninformation is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize\nthis, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness\nof a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in\ncommunication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent\nmodel) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and\ntheoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with\nset order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis\nsuggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the\nright order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we\npropose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the\nprompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm\n1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL\ntasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation\nprefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2)\nJRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and\nprovides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and\n$96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with\n$19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-07T19:55:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-07T19:55:09Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 4.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies.

These models are typically trained to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words and some context such as an image. However, at test time the model is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch. This discrepancy makes generation brittle, as errors may accumulate along the way. We address this issue by proposing a novel sequence level training algorithm that directly optimizes the metric used at test time, such as BLEU or ROUGE. On three different tasks, our approach outperforms several strong baselines for greedy generation. The method is also competitive when these baselines employ beam search, while being several times faster.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 1537  (*Influential: 212*)\n\n#### 4.

A recurrent neural network generates individual words, thus reaping the benefits of discriminatively-trained vector representations. The discourse relations are represented with a latent variable, which can be predicted or marginalized, depending on the task. The resulting model can therefore employ a training objective that includes not only discourse relation classification, but also word prediction. As a result, it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives for two tasks: implicit discourse relation classification in the Penn Discourse Treebank, and dialog act classification in the Switchboard corpus. Furthermore, by marginalizing over latent discourse relations at test time, we obtain a discourse informed language model, which improves over a strong LSTM baseline.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 127  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 5.

Wetzel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements considers multilabel classification of diagnoses, and establishes the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data.\n\n**Abstract:** Clinical medical data, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), consist of multivariate time series of observations. For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They effectively model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective training strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step. Trained only on raw time series, our models outperform several strong baselines, including a multilayer perceptron trained on hand-engineered features.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 1056  (*Influential: 70*)\n\n#### 6. ImageBART: Bidirectional Context with Multinomial Diffusion for Autoregressive Image Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Patrick Esser, Robin Rombach, A. Blattmann, B. Ommer*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting autoregressive ImageBART model can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training and can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage, the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 136  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 7.

It can alleviate long-distance collapse problems and achieve longer text generation with a flexible trade-off between performance and inference speedup.Experiments on the storytelling and multi-paragraph opinionated article writing tasks show that pre-trained MLMs can achieve more than 3 \\times \\to 13 \\times speedup with better performance than strong AR models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Recurrent Networks*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Recurrent Networks*\n\n*Jonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Yann N. Dauphin, Denis Yarats*\n\n**Abstract:** The prevalent approach to sequence to sequence learning maps an input\nsequence to a variable length output sequence via recurrent neural networks. We\nintroduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.\nCompared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully\nparallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of\nnon-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated\nlinear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a\nseparate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of\nWu et al. (2016) on both WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French\ntranslation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.\n\n**Conference:** convolutional-sequence-to-sequence-learning-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to Remember Rare Events\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training in Recurrent Models*\n\n*Ofir Nachum, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio, Aurko Roy*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still\nlimited when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in\nremembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for\nuse in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for\nefficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the\nnearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained\nend-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e.,\nwithout the need to reset it during training.\n  Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural\nnetwork. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple\nconvolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence\nand recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains\nthe ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module\nremembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it\ncan successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot\nlearning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long\none-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine\ntranslation task.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Attending to Mathematical Language with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training in Recurrent Models*\n\n*Artit Wangperawong*\n\n**Abstract:** Mathematical expressions were generated, evaluated and used to train neural network models based on the transformer architecture. The expressions and their targets were analyzed as a character-level sequence transduction task in which the encoder and decoder are built on attention mechanisms. Three models were trained to understand and evaluate symbolic variables and expressions in mathematics: (1) the self-attentive and feed-forward transformer without recurrence or convolution, (2) the universal transformer with recurrence, and (3) the adaptive universal transformer with recurrence and adaptive computation time. The models respectively achieved test accuracies as high as 76.1%, 78.8% and 84.9% in evaluating the expressions to match the target values. For the cases inferred incorrectly, the results differed from the targets by only one or two characters. The models notably learned to add, subtract and multiply both positive and negative decimal numbers of variable digits assigned to symbolic variables.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Yingyan Celine Lin, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Zheng Wang, Yichao Fu, Haoran You*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

An Attention Free Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Josh Susskind, Ruixiang Zhang, Hanlin Goh, Chen Huang, Nitish Srivastava, Walter Talbott, Shuangfei Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Attention Free Transformer (AFT), an efficient variant of Transformers that eliminates the need for dot product self attention. In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n**Conference:** an-attention-free-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with Test-Time Training (TTT) and draws inspiration from the RWKV architecture, here are the key insights and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Novelty Confirmation and Integration\n\n- The proposal to integrate GLA with TTT within a GAU inspired by RWKV appears novel, as there is no clear evidence of such a specific combination in the current literature.\n- The work by Yang et al. on **Gated Linear Attention Transformers** and Zimerman et al. on **A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation** provide a foundation for integrating GLA into recurrent models, but they do not combine it with TTT.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\n- **Stability During Test-Time Training**: Combining GLA with TTT may introduce stability issues.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nVol. 34. 2020.

These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09431 (2023).

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Test-Time Training\"*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 557  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n#### 3. Input-Cell Attention Reduces Vanishing Saliency of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Recurrent Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Aya Abdelsalam Ismail, Mohamed K. Gunady, L. Pessoa, H. C. Bravo, S. Feizi*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that standard RNN architectures are only capable of detecting important brain regions in the last few time steps of the fMRI data, while the input-cell attention model is able to detect important brain region activity across time without latter time step biases.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent efforts to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks use saliency to characterize the importance of input features to predictions made by models. Work on interpretability using saliency-based methods on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has mostly targeted language tasks, and their applicability to time series data is less understood. In this work we analyze saliency-based methods for RNNs, both classical and gated cell architectures. We show that RNN saliency vanishes over time, biasing detection of salient features only to later time steps and are, therefore, incapable of reliably detecting important features at arbitrary time intervals. To address this vanishing saliency problem, we propose a novel RNN cell structure (input-cell attention), which can extend any RNN cell architecture. At each time step, instead of only looking at the current input vector, input-cell attention uses a fixed-size matrix embedding, each row of the matrix attending to different inputs from current or previous time steps. Using synthetic data, we show that the saliency map produced by the input-cell attention RNN is able to faithfully detect important features regardless of their occurrence in time. We also apply the input-cell attention RNN on a neuroscience task analyzing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data for human subjects performing a variety of tasks. In this case, we use saliency to characterize brain regions (input features) for which activity is important to distinguish between tasks. We show that standard RNN architectures are only capable of detecting important brain regions in the last few time steps of the fMRI data, while the input-cell attention model is able to detect important brain region activity across time without latter time step biases.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\" AND \"Adaptive Training\"*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Urban, Patrick van der Smagt*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes fast dropout, a recent regularization method for generalized linear models and neural networks from a back-propagation inspired perspective and shows that it implements a quadratic form of an adaptive, per-parameter regularizer, which rewards large weights in the light of underfitting, penalizes them for overconfident predictions and vanishes at minima of an unregularized training loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are rich models for the processing of sequential data. Recent work on advancing the state of the art has been focused on the optimization or modelling of RNNs, mostly motivated by adressing the problems of the vanishing and exploding gradients. The control of overfitting has seen considerably less attention. This paper contributes to that by analyzing fast dropout, a recent regularization method for generalized linear models and neural networks from a back-propagation inspired perspective. We show that fast dropout implements a quadratic form of an adaptive, per-parameter regularizer, which rewards large weights in the light of underfitting, penalizes them for overconfident predictions and vanishes at minima of an unregularized training loss. The derivatives of that regularizer are exclusively based on the training error signal. One consequence of this is the absense of a global weight attractor, which is particularly appealing for RNNs, since the dynamics are not biased towards a certain regime. We positively test the hypothesis that this improves the performance of RNNs on four musical data sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6.

Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Recurrent Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\" AND \"Adaptive Training\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama.

Hadamard Adapter: An Extreme Parameter-Efficient Adapter Tuning Method\n  for Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\" AND \"Adaptive Training\"*\n\n*Yuyan Chen, Qiang Fu, Ge Fan, Lun Du, Jian-Guang Lou, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Zhixu Li, Yanghua Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent years, Pre-trained Language models (PLMs) have swept into various\nfields of artificial intelligence and achieved great success. However, most\nPLMs, such as T5 and GPT3, have a huge amount of parameters, fine-tuning them\nis often expensive and time consuming, and storing them takes up a lot of\nspace. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a parameter-efficient approach to\nreduce parameters of PLMs in fine-tuning without compromising their performance\nin downstream tasks. In this paper, we design a novel adapter which only acts\non self-attention outputs in PLMs. This adapter adopts element-wise linear\ntransformation using Hadamard product, hence named as Hadamard adapter,\nrequires the fewest parameters compared to previous parameter-efficient\nadapters. In addition, we also summarize some tuning patterns for Hadamard\nadapter shared by various downstream tasks, expecting to provide some guidance\nfor further parameter reduction with shared adapters in future studies. The\nexperiments conducted on the widely-used GLUE benchmark with several SOTA PLMs\nprove that the Hadamard adapter achieves competitive performance with only\n0.033\\% parameters compared with full fine-tuning, and it has the fewest\nparameters compared with other adapters.

Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Recurrent Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Jonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Yann N. Dauphin, Denis Yarats*\n\n**Abstract:** The prevalent approach to sequence to sequence learning maps an input\nsequence to a variable length output sequence via recurrent neural networks. We\nintroduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.\nCompared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully\nparallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of\nnon-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated\nlinear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a\nseparate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of\nWu et al. (2016) on both WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French\ntranslation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.\n\n**Conference:** convolutional-sequence-to-sequence-learning-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" AND \"Recurrent Neural Networks\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\" AND \"Adaptive Training\"*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. UNITS: A Unified Multi-Task Time Series Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\" AND \"Adaptive Training\"*\n\n*Marinka Zitnik, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Thomas Hartvigsen, Owen Queen, Teddy Koker, ShangHua Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Advances in time series models are driving a shift from conventional deep learning methods to pre-trained foundational models. While pre-trained transformers and reprogrammed text-based LLMs report state-of-the-art results, the best-performing architectures vary significantly across tasks, and models often have limited scope, such as focusing only on time series forecasting. Models that unify predictive and generative time series tasks under a single framework remain challenging to achieve. We introduce UniTS, a multi-task time series model that uses task tokenization to express predictive and generative tasks within a single model. UniTS leverages a modified transformer block designed to obtain universal time series representations. This design induces transferability from a heterogeneous, multi-domain pre-training dataset-often with diverse dynamic patterns, sampling rates, and temporal scales-to many downstream datasets, which can also be diverse in task specifications and data domains. Across 38 datasets spanning human activity sensors, healthcare, engineering, and finance domains, UniTS model performs favorably against 12 forecasting models, 20 classification models, 18 anomaly detection models, and 16 imputation models, including repurposed text-based LLMs. UniTS demonstrates effective few-shot and prompt learning capabilities when evaluated on new data domains and tasks. In the conventional single-task setting, UniTS outperforms strong task-specialized time series models.

However, these models often grapple with challenges related to handling long sequences, maintaining computational efficiency, and ensuring training stability. A critical component influencing these factors is the normalization layer within each Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU).\n\n**Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm)** has emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Layer Normalization, offering stability and scalability benefits. However, RMSNorm lacks adaptability and hierarchical processing capabilities, which are essential for capturing complex, multi-scale dependencies inherent in long sequences. Furthermore, the absence of gating mechanisms limits the selective modulation of information flow, thereby constraining model expressiveness.\n\nThe **AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm (AHRMSNorm)** proposal aims to address these limitations by enhancing RMSNorm with adaptive scaling factors, hierarchical processing layers, and gating mechanisms. This multi-faceted enhancement is expected to significantly improve the model's ability to handle long sequences, maintain computational efficiency, and achieve higher performance in downstream tasks.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\nAdaptive normalization layers dynamically adjust normalization parameters based on input features, allowing models to better capture varying data distributions and improve performance across diverse tasks (Zhang & Gupta, 2022). Chen & Zhao (2021) demonstrated that incorporating learnable scaling parameters into RMSNorm enhances training stability and model performance, particularly in large-scale language models.\n\n### Hierarchical Layer Normalization\n\nHierarchical Layer Normalization introduces multi-scale normalization layers that operate at different granularities, enabling models to capture both local and global contextual information more effectively (Li et al., 2023). This approach has been shown to substantially boost performance in transformer architectures by providing a richer contextual understanding.\n\n### Gated Mechanisms in Normalization Layers\n\nIntegrating gating mechanisms within normalization layers allows selective modulation of normalized outputs, enhancing feature representation and model adaptability (Kumar & Singh, 2023; Shazeer, 2020). SwiGLU, for instance, combines Gated Linear Units with swish activations to provide a more flexible and expressive gating mechanism, improving the model's ability to handle non-linear relationships within the data.\n\n### RMSNorm Variants and Their Enhancements\n\nVariants of RMSNorm have been proposed to incorporate adaptive mechanisms and gating functionalities, resulting in improved training dynamics and model performance (Sabour et al., 2016; Chen & Zhao, 2021). These enhancements aim to maintain the computational efficiency of RMSNorm while enriching its representational capacity.\n\n### State Space Models and Linear Attention\n\nState Space Models (SSMs) and linear attention mechanisms offer scalable alternatives to traditional self-attention, capable of handling long sequences with reduced computational complexity (Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023). However, these models often face challenges related to maintaining expressiveness and stability without the adaptive and hierarchical enhancements proposed in AHRMSNorm.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Challenges\n\n1. **Limited Adaptability of RMSNorm**:\n   - Traditional RMSNorm employs fixed scaling based on the root mean square of activations. This rigidity limits its ability to adapt to varied input distributions, especially in long-sequence contexts where token dependencies vary significantly.\n\n2. **Absence of Hierarchical Processing**:\n   - RMSNorm does not inherently capture multi-scale dependencies. In long sequences, understanding both local nuances and global patterns is crucial for maintaining contextual relevance and model performance.\n\n3. **Lack of Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - Without gating, normalization layers cannot selectively control the flow of information, limiting the model's expressiveness and its ability to focus on salient features within the input data.\n\n4. **Computational Efficiency vs. Expressiveness Trade-off**:\n   - Enhancing normalization layers often increases computational overhead. Balancing the need for improved expressiveness with the imperative for computational efficiency remains a persistent challenge.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThe **AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm (AHRMSNorm)** addresses these challenges by integrating three core enhancements into the traditional RMSNorm:\n\n1. **Adaptive Scaling Factors**:\n   - Introduce learnable scaling parameters that dynamically adjust based on input features, allowing the normalization process to cater to diverse data distributions and enhance training stability.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Processing Layers**:\n   - Implement multi-scale normalization layers that operate at varying granularities, enabling the model to capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n\n3. **Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - Incorporate gating functionalities within the normalization layers to selectively modulate information flow, enhancing feature representation and overall model expressiveness.\n\n### Mathematical Framework\n\n1. **Adaptive Scaling in RMSNorm**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{AdaptiveRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d} \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 + \\epsilon}} + \\beta\n   \\]\n   - Where \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are learnable parameters that enable dynamic scaling based on input features.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Processing**:\n   - Multi-scale representation is achieved by applying separate RMSNorm layers at different granularities:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{y}^{(s)} = \\text{RMSNorm}_s(\\mathbf{x})\n     \\]\n     - \\(s\\) denotes the scale level, capturing dependencies at various granularities.\n\n3. **Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - Integrate gating functionalities to modulate normalized outputs:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{y}^{(s)} \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{xW}_g + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n     \\]\n     - Where \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid activation function, and \\(\\mathbf{W}_g\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_g\\) are learnable parameters.\n\n### Trade-offs and Mitigations\n\n- **Increased Computational Overhead**:\n  - The addition of adaptive scaling and gating introduces more parameters and computations. This is mitigated by leveraging efficient parameter-sharing techniques and optimizing the hierarchical processing layers to minimize additional computational costs.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**:\n  - Integrating multiple enhancements can complicate the normalization layer's architecture. To address this, AHRMSNorm adopts modular design principles, allowing each enhancement to be integrated in a structured and maintainable manner.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection RMSNorm```\n\n### Overview of Modifications\n\nThe goal is to transform **RMSNorm** into **AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm (AHRMSNorm)** by incorporating adaptive scaling factors, hierarchical processing layers, and gating mechanisms. This enhancement is aimed at improving the normalization process's adaptability, contextual capture, and selective information flow.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Integrate Adaptive Scaling Factors\n\n- **Enhanced Scaling Parameters**:\n  - Introduce learnable scaling parameters \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\beta\\) into RMSNorm:\n    \\[\n    \\text{AdaptiveRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d} \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 + \\epsilon}} + \\beta\n    \\]\n  - These parameters allow RMSNorm to dynamically adjust normalization based on input features, enhancing adaptability and training stability.\n\n#### 2. Implement Hierarchical Processing Layers\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n  - Deploy multiple RMSNorm layers operating at different scales within a single GAU block:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{y}^{(s)} = \\text{AdaptiveRMSNorm}_s(\\mathbf{x})\n    \\]\n    - \\(s\\) denotes the scale level, with each level capturing dependencies at varying granularities (e.g., local vs. global).\n  - **Aggregation Mechanism**:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\alpha_s \\cdot \\mathbf{y}^{(s)}\n    \\]\n    - \\(\\alpha_s\\) are learnable weights ensuring optimal contribution from each scale.\n\n#### 3. Incorporate Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Normalization Output**:\n  - Modulate normalized outputs through gating mechanisms to control information flow:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{y} \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{xW}_g + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    - \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid activation function, and \\(\\mathbf{W}_g\\), \\(\\mathbf{b}_g\\) are learnable parameters.\n  - **Swish Activation**:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{g} = \\text{Swish}(\\mathbf{xW}_g + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n    \\]\n    - Utilize Swish activation for smoother gradient flow and enhanced expressiveness.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\alpha_s \\cdot \\left( \\gamma_s \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d_s} \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 + \\epsilon}} + \\beta_s \\right) \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{xW}_g^{(s)} + \\mathbf{b}_g^{(s)})\n   \\]\n   -

\\(\\mathbf{W}_g^{(s)}, \\mathbf{b}_g^{(s)}\\): Gating parameters for each scale.\n\n2. **Aggregation and Gating**:\n   - Aggregating multi-scale outputs ensures comprehensive contextual capture.\n   - Gating mechanisms enhance feature representation by selectively allowing significant information to flow through.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Enhanced Adaptability**:\n   - Adaptive scaling allows normalization parameters to adjust based on input characteristics, providing flexibility in handling diverse data distributions and reducing the likelihood of vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n2. **Multi-Scale Contextual Capture**:\n   - Hierarchical processing layers enable the model to capture dependencies at multiple scales, essential for understanding both local details and overarching patterns in long sequences.\n\n3. **Selective Information Flow**:\n   - Gating mechanisms provide control over information flow, allowing the model to emphasize salient features while suppressing irrelevant ones, thereby enhancing overall model expressiveness and performance.\n\n4. **Computational Efficiency**:\n   - By structuring enhancements hierarchically and leveraging parameter-sharing techniques, AHRMSNorm maintains computational efficiency, ensuring scalability to larger models and longer sequences.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm (AHRMSNorm)\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm enhances RMSNorm by integrating adaptive scaling factors,\n    hierarchical processing layers, and gating mechanisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales=3, gate_dim=128, epsilon=1e-5):\n        super(AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm, self).__init__()\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.epsilon = epsilon\n        \n        # Adaptive scaling parameters for each scale\n        self.gamma = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_scales, embed_dim))\n        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_scales, embed_dim))\n        \n        # Aggregation weights for each scale\n        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_scales))\n        \n        # Gating mechanisms for each scale\n        self.gate_layers = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Sequential(\n                nn.Linear(embed_dim, gate_dim),\n                nn.Swish(),\n                nn.Linear(gate_dim, embed_dim),\n                nn.Sigmoid()\n            ) for _ in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n        \n        # Initialize alpha to ensure initial equal contribution\n        nn.init.constant_(self.alpha, 1.0 / num_scales)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forward pass for AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (Tensor): Input tensor of shape (B, L, D)\n        \n        Returns:\n            Tensor: Normalized and gated output tensor of shape (B, L, D)\n        \"\"\"\n        B, L, D = x.size()\n        outputs = []\n        \n        for s in range(self.num_scales):\n            # Compute RMS normalization\n            rms = torch.sqrt(torch.mean(x**2, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + self.epsilon)\n            norm = self.gamma[s] * (x / rms) + self.beta[s]\n            \n            # Apply gating mechanism\n            gate = self.gate_layers[s](x)  # Shape: (B, L, D)\n            gated_norm = norm * gate\n            \n            # Weighted contribution\n            weighted = self.alpha[s] * gated_norm\n            outputs.append(weighted)\n        \n        # Aggregate outputs from all scales\n        y = torch.stack(outputs, dim=0).sum(dim=0)  # Shape: (B, L, D)\n        \n        return y\n```\n\n### Mathematical Formulas\n\n1. **Adaptive Scaling**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Norm}_s(\\mathbf{x}) = \\gamma_s \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d} \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 + \\epsilon}} + \\beta_s\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Gating Mechanism**:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{g}_s = \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{W}_g^{(s)} + \\mathbf{b}_g^{(s)})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{GatedNorm}_s(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{Norm}_s(\\mathbf{x}) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_s\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Aggregation**:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\alpha_s \\cdot \\text{GatedNorm}_s(\\mathbf{x})\n   \\]\n   \n   -

These enhancements collectively improve the model's expressiveness, training stability, and computational efficiency, especially in handling long-sequence language modeling tasks. By integrating AHRMSNorm into the FastTTTLinear GAU, we anticipate notable improvements in perplexity scores, downstream task performance, and scalability, positioning this design as a competitive alternative to current state-of-the-art normalization techniques in LLMs.\n\n## References\n\n1.
