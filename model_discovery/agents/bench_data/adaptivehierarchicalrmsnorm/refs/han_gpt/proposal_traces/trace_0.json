Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 2. Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Qianchao Zhu, Jiangfei Duan, Chang Chen, Siran Liu, Xiuhong Li, Guanyu Feng, Xin Lv, Huanqi Cao, Chuanfu Xiao, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin, Chao Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention, which can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times compared with FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in Transformers for Long Context Window Extending\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer attention*\n\n*Yifan Wu, Siqiao Xue, Jianguo Li, Qi Zhang, Wei Jiang, Jing Ye, Shiyi Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention and position embedding are two key modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors harming long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention unveiled by our work. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (Collinear Constrained Attention). Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between $Q$ and $K$ to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention. While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive experiments show that CoCA performs extraordinarily well in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can seamlessly extend the context window up to 32K (60$\\times$), without any fine-tuning. Additionally, by dropping CoCA in LLaMA-7B, we achieve extrapolation up to 32K within only 2K training length.

Fovea Transformer: Efficient Long-Context Modeling with Structured Fine-to-Coarse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer attention*\n\n*Bo Jiang, Jingwen Leng, Le Zhou, Jian Yuan, Ziwei He*\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformers has hindered the processing of long text. To alleviate this problem, previous works have proposed to sparsify the attention matrix, taking advantage of the observation that crucial information about a token can be derived from its neighbors. These methods typically combine one or another form of local attention and global attention. Such combinations introduce abrupt changes in contextual granularity when going from local to global, which may be undesirable. We believe that a smoother transition could potentially enhance model's ability to capture long-context dependencies. In this study, we introduce Fovea Transformer, a long-context focused transformer that addresses the challenges of capturing global dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. To achieve this, we construct a multi-scale tree from the input sequence, and use representations of context tokens with a progressively coarser granularity in the tree, as their distance to the query token increases. We evaluate our model on three long-context summarization tasks\\footnote{Our code is publicly available at: \\textit{https://github.com/ZiweiHe/Fovea-Transformer}}. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on two of them, and competitive results on the third with mixed improvement and setback of the evaluation metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: long context transformer attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly in handling long sequences, several recent techniques and advancements in attention mechanisms, memory management, and efficient computation patterns are noteworthy.\n\n## Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Differential Transformer\nThe Differential Transformer introduces a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. This approach cancels out noise and amplifies attention to relevant context, reducing the model's distraction by irrelevant information. This mechanism is shown to improve performance in long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, and in-context learning, making it highly effective for handling long sequences.\n\n### InAttention\nInAttention is another approach that replaces traditional self-attention with a mechanism where tokens attend only to initial states, scaling linearly with context length during inference. This reduces VRAM usage significantly, enabling the handling of long sequences on consumer GPUs. It also improves performance on long sequences without high training costs.\n\n## Memory Management and Compression\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nHierarchical attention mechanisms allow models to focus on different levels of context, structuring attention layers to prioritize information from broader contexts while attending to finer details. This hierarchical approach can help in managing long context windows more efficiently.\n\n### Memory-Augmented Neural Networks\nIncorporating external memory components enables models to store and retrieve information over longer sequences. This is particularly useful in tasks where retaining historical context is essential, helping to manage memory more effectively.\n\n### Equal-Info Windows\nThis technique involves segmenting text into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale. This intelligent compression can help in reducing the memory footprint while maintaining performance[Initial Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Computation Patterns\n\n### Segmented Input Processing\nDividing input sequences into manageable segments can help models process longer contexts without overwhelming computational resources. Each segment can be processed independently, with the results combined to form a comprehensive understanding of the entire input.\n\n### Linear Attention Variants\nLinear attention variants, such as those used in InAttention, offer significant computational efficiency improvements. By scaling linearly with context length, these models reduce the quadratic complexity associated with traditional attention mechanisms, making them more efficient for handling long sequences.\n\n### Adaptive Context Windows\nImplementing adaptive mechanisms that adjust the context window size based on the input can enhance performance. Models can dynamically increase the context window for complex inputs while maintaining a smaller window for simpler ones, optimizing computational resources.\n\n## Position Encoding\n\n### Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE)\nFIRE uses a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle long sequences by providing better position encoding schemes[Initial Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling long sequences effectively. The differential attention mechanism, hierarchical attention, intelligent compression, and adaptive computation approaches are particularly promising for achieving these goals.\n",

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 5. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2020)\t**Cited by** 1155  (*Influential: 164*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2019) and Kitaev et al. (2020). The former (Child et al., 2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix reducing the overall complexity from quadratic to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ for generative modeling of long sequences. More recently, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed Reformer. This method further reduces complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ by using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to perform fewer dot products. Note that in order to be able to use LSH, Reformer constrains the keys, for the attention, to be identical to the queries. As a result this method cannot be used for decoding tasks where the keys need to be different from the queries. In comparison, linear transformers impose no constraints on the queries and keys and scale linearly with respect to the sequence length. Furthermore, they can be used to perform inference in autoregressive tasks three orders of magnitude faster, achieving comparable performance in terms of validation perplexity. ### 2.2. Understanding Self-Attention\n\nThere have been few efforts to better understand selfattention from a theoretical perspective. Tsai et al. (2019) proposed a kernel-based formulation of attention in transformers which considers attention as applying a kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the similarity between inputs. This formulation provides a better way to understand attention components and integrate the positional embedding. In contrast, we use the kernel formulation to speed up the calculation of self-attention and lower its computational complexity. Also, we observe that if a kernel with positive similarity scores is applied on the queries and keys, linear attention converges normally. More recently, Cordonnier et al. (2020) provided theoretical proofs and empirical evidence that a multi-head selfattention with sufficient number of heads can express any convolutional layer. Here, we instead show that a selfattention layer trained with an autoregressive objective can be seen as a recurrent neural network and this observation can be used to significantly speed up inference time of autoregressive transformer models. ### 2.3. Linearized softmax\n\nFor many years, softmax has been the bottleneck for training classification models with a large number of categories (Goodman, 2001; Morin \\& Bengio, 2005; Mnih \\& Hinton, 2009). Recent works (Blanc \\& Rendle, 2017; Rawat et al., 2019), have approximated softmax with a linear dot product of feature maps to speed up the training through sampling. Inspired from these works, we linearize the softmax attention in transformers. Concurrently with this work, Shen et al. (2020) explored the use of linearized attention for the task of object detection in images. In comparison, we do not only linearize the attention computation, but also develop an autoregressive transformer model with linear complexity and constant memory for both inference and training. Moreover, we show that through the lens of kernels, every transformer can be seen as a recurrent neural network. ## 3. Linear Transformers\n\nIn this section, we formalize our proposed linear transformer. We present that changing the attention from the traditional softmax attention to a feature map based dot product attention results in better time and memory complexity as well as a causal model that can perform sequence generation in linear time, similar to a recurrent neural network. Initially, in $\\S 3.1$, we introduce a formulation for the transformer architecture introduced in (Vaswani et al., 2017). Subsequently, in $\\S 3.2$ and $\\S 3.3$ we present our proposed linear transformer and finally, in $\\S 3.4$ we rewrite the transformer as a recurrent neural network. ### 3.1. Transformers\n\nLet $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}$ denote a sequence of $N$ feature vectors of dimensions $F$. A transformer is a function $T: \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}$ defined by the composition of $L$ transformer layers $T_{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, T_{L}(\\cdot)$ as follows,\n\n$$\nT_{l}(x)=f_{l}\\left(A_{l}(x)+x\\right)\n$$\n\nThe function $f_{l}(\\cdot)$ transforms each feature independently of the others and is usually implemented with a small two-layer feedforward network. $A_{l}(\\cdot)$ is the self attention function and is the only part of the transformer that acts across sequences. The self attention function $A_{l}(\\cdot)$ computes, for every position, a weighted average of the feature representations of all other positions with a weight proportional to a similarity score between the representations. Formally, the input sequence $x$ is projected by three matrices $W_{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times D}$, $W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times D}$ and $W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times M}$ to corresponding representations $Q, K$ and $V$. The output for all positions, $A_{l}(x)=V^{\\prime}$, is computed as follows,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ & =x W_{Q} \\\\\nK & =x W_{K} \\\\\nV & =x W_{V} \\\\\nA_{l}(x)=V^{\\prime} & =\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{D}}\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that in the previous equation, the softmax function is applied rowwise to $Q K^{T}$. Following common terminology, the $Q, K$ and $V$ are referred to as the \"queries\", \"keys\" and \"values\" respectively. Equation 2 implements a specific form of self-attention called softmax attention where the similarity score is the exponential of the dot product between a query and a key. Given that subscripting a matrix with $i$ returns the $i$-th row as a vector, we can write a generalized attention equation for any similarity function as follows,\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\operatorname{sim}\\left(Q_{i}, K_{j}\\right) V_{j}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\operatorname{sim}\\left(Q_{i}, K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nEquation 3 is equivalent to equation 2 if we substitute the similarity function with $\\operatorname{sim}(q, k)=\\exp \\left(\\frac{q^{T} k}{\\sqrt{D}}\\right)$. ### 3.2. Linearized Attention\n\nThe definition of attention in equation 2 is generic and can be used to define several other attention implementations such as polynomial attention or RBF kernel attention (Tsai et al., 2019). Note that the only constraint we need to impose to $\\operatorname{sim}(\\cdot)$, in order for equation 3 to define an attention function, is to be non-negative. This includes all kernels $k(x, y): \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times F} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Given such a kernel with a feature representation $\\phi(x)$ we can rewrite equation 2 as follows,\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nand then further simplify it by making use of the associative property of matrix multiplication to\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}^{T}}{\\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe above equation is simpler to follow when the numerator is written in vectorized form as follows,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\phi(Q) \\phi(K)^{T}\\right) V=\\phi(Q)\\left(\\phi(K)^{T} V\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that the feature map $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is applied rowwise to the matrices $Q$ and $K$. From equation 2, it is evident that the computational cost of softmax attention scales with $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$, where $N$ represents the sequence length. The same is true for the memory requirements because the full attention matrix must be stored to compute the gradients with respect to the queries, keys and values. In contrast, our proposed linear transformer from equation 5 has time and memory complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ because we can compute $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}^{T}$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)$ once and reuse them for every query. ### 3.2.1. Feature Maps and Computational Cost\n\nFor softmax attention, the total cost in terms of multiplications and additions scales as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2} \\max (D, M)\\right)$, where $D$ is the dimensionality of the queries and keys and $M$ is the dimensionality of the values. On the contrary, for linear attention, we first compute the feature maps of dimensionality $C$. Subsequently, computing the new values requires $\\mathcal{O}(N C M)$ additions and multiplications. The previous analysis does not take into account the choice of kernel and feature function. Note that the feature function that corresponds to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional, which makes the linearization of exact softmax attention infeasible. On the other hand, the polynomial kernel, for example, has an exact finite dimensional feature map and has been shown to work equally well with the exponential or RBF kernel (Tsai et al., 2019). The computational cost for a linearized polynomial transformer of degree 2 is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N D^{2} M\\right)$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: kernel attention linear complexity\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention linear complexity*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: kernel attention linear complexity*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset. It provides a novel method and a simple yet strong baseline for the community.

This is highlighted in the work \"Transformers are RNNs\" where the authors use the associativity property of matrix products to achieve this reduction.\n\n## Attention Tensorization\n\n- **Attention Tensorization**: This method involves decomposing long sequences into compact tensor representations and applying attention on each transformed dimension. This approach, known as Tensorized Attention, allows for efficient handling of long-range dependencies with improved memory and time efficiency. It naturally encodes multi-hop hierarchical token interactions, making attention more efficiently approximated compared to vector space representations.\n\n## Sparse and Structured Attention\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This method introduces intrinsic sparse attention by learning block-wise attention sparsity from the model itself. It customizes the FlashAttention kernel to extract targeted block-wise attention maps without maintaining the full-size attention map, achieving significant speedup and scalability, especially in long-context scenarios.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n- **FlashAttention**: Modern LLMs often use FlashAttention, which fuses operations to improve efficiency. However, naive implementations of attention maps in long-context scenarios are impractical due to quadratic memory complexity. Customized kernels, such as those used in SeerAttention, can efficiently extract max-pooled attention maps, minimizing overhead and boosting scalability.\n\n## Combining Local and Global Attention Patterns\n\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Tiling strategies can be used to separately handle intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculations. This approach optimizes attention computation for hardware efficiency, as seen in \"Lightning Attention-2\"[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## Position Encoding and Context Management\n\n- **Collinear Constrained Attention**: Integrating position encoding with attention constraints, such as collinear constraints between query (Q) and key (K), can enhance long context window extrapolation ability. This is demonstrated in the work \"CoCA\"[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n\n## State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Selective Context Management**: SSMs, particularly models like S4 and Mamba, offer efficient handling of long sequences with linear complexity. These models use data-dependent SSM layers and selective context management, allowing for better context compression and selectivity in focusing on or filtering inputs based on context.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Linear Attention**: Use kernel feature maps to reduce attention complexity to \\(O(N)\\).\n- **Attention Tensorization**: Decompose sequences into tensor representations for efficient attention calculation.\n- **Sparse Attention**: Implement block-wise sparsity and customized kernels like SeerAttention for efficiency and scalability.\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Optimize attention computation using tiling for hardware efficiency[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n- **Position Encoding**: Integrate position information with attention constraints for better long-range modeling[Analysis Note - Round 1].\n- **SSMs**: Utilize selective context management in SSMs for efficient and effective sequence modeling.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive LMs that achieve linear complexity in attention computation while maintaining or improving model effectiveness.\n",

This capability is particularly significant in applications that demand deep understanding and synthesis of large volumes of information, such as summarization (Huang et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2023; Song et al., 2022; Kry\u015bci\u0144ski et al., 2021), reading comprehension (Nguyen et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023), long-form generation (Guan et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2022; Roziere et al., 2023), and\n\n[^0]complex reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). However, it is challenging to extend the context window from different viewpoints: First, the predominant LLM model uses Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (OpenAI, 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) employ full attention in each layer which inherently incurs quadratic time and memory complexity. This may potentially diminish the efficiency of both the training and inference processes. Second, attention computation over an extremely long sequence might lead to an almost even distribution, potentially causing the omission of vital information (Han et al., 2023). This may further lead to the issue of being \"lost in the middle\" (Liu et al., 2023). Finally, the distribution of training signals for long and short sequences is imbalanced. It is evident that longer sequences are infrequent in both plain text and instructiontuning data. Consequently, this rarity poses a challenge in effectively capturing long-term dependencies during the training process. To tackle the above issues, we propose to group local-global attention layers into blocks during the training and inference phases. This strategy enhances efficiency while yielding results comparable to those of a global attention Transformer. Notably, it attains equivalent performance levels with merely half the computational effort required for training. Additionally, this approach significantly reduces memory consumption during inference by maintaining a local Key-Value (K-V) cache specifically for the local attention layers. In Section 2.1, we list the two critical components essential for a long-context model as well as the potential alternatives for consideration. These encompass diverse attention mechanisms and methodologies for positional embedding. Subsequently, in Section 2.2, we conduct a comparative analysis of these alternatives, presenting their em-\npirical outcomes for a comprehensive evaluation. Integrating these insights, we name our model Zebra, drawing an analogy to the alternating black and white stripes of a zebra, which resemble the grouped local and global layers in our model's architecture. To validate the proposed model at large scales, Section 3 details the continuation of training the Llama-2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023) using long-context adaptation training through Zebra. This approach not only exhibits comparable performance on short-sequence benchmarks but also achieves superior perplexity results for longer sequences. Additionally, in Section 4, we conduct fine-tuning of Zebra using a combination of both short and long instruction-tuning datasets. This is followed by a systematic evaluation of the model's performance across a range of benchmark datasets. It demonstrates generally better performance on both long and short benchmarks compared to Llama-2-7b-chat. To Conclude, our contribution is 3 -fold:\n\n- We develop a novel architecture, referred to as Zebra, which incorporates grouped localglobal attention layers and rotary positional embedding. - We conduct comprehensive experiments and detailed analyses of the Zebra framework across various settings, including pretraining from scratch, continuation of training, and extensive instruction tuning. The findings from these results demonstrate the advantage of $\\mathbf{Z e}$ bra model architecture. - Additionally, we analyze the training and inference efficiency for Zebra and provide the pseudocode for implementation. ## 2 Zebra\n\n### 2.1 Model Architecture Design\n\nTo extend the context window for Transformer models, two critical elements must be addressed: First, the Attention mechanism that allows the model to efficiently focus on and process relevant parts of long sequences.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg.

However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

More ConvNets in the 2020s: Scaling up Kernels Beyond 51x51 using Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention architecture state management*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Decebal Mocanu, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Tommi K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, Boqian Wu, Qiao Xiao, Xuxi Chen, Xiaohan Chen, Tianlong Chen, Shiwei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. RetiFluidNet: A Self-Adaptive and Multi-Attention Deep Convolutional Network for Retinal OCT Fluid Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention architecture state management*\n\n*Sina Farsiu, Ziyun Yang, Mohammad Rezapourian, Armin Biglari, Reza Rasti*\n\n**Abstract:** Optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps ophthalmologists assess macular edema, accumulation of fluids, and lesions at microscopic resolution. Quantification of retinal fluids is necessary for OCT-guided treatment management, which relies on a precise image segmentation step. As manual analysis of retinal fluids is a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone task, there is increasing demand for fast and robust automatic solutions. In this study, a new convolutional neural architecture named RetiFluidNet is proposed for multi-class retinal fluid segmentation. The model benefits from hierarchical representation learning of textural, contextual, and edge features using a new self-adaptive dual-attention (SDA) module, multiple self-adaptive attention-based skip connections (SASC), and a novel multi-scale deep self supervision learning (DSL) scheme. The attention mechanism in the proposed SDA module enables the model to automatically extract deformation-aware representations at different levels, and the introduced SASC paths further consider spatial-channel interdependencies for concatenation of counterpart encoder and decoder units, which improve representational capability. RetiFluidNet is also optimized using a joint loss function comprising a weighted version of dice overlap and edge-preserved connectivity-based losses, where several hierarchical stages of multi-scale local losses are integrated into the optimization process. The model is validated based on three publicly available datasets: RETOUCH, OPTIMA, and DUKE, with comparisons against several baselines. Experimental results on the datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in retinal OCT fluid segmentation and reveal that the suggested method is more effective than existing state-of-the-art fluid segmentation algorithms in adapting to retinal OCT scans recorded by various image scanning instruments.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design, focusing on hierarchical attention architectures and efficient state management for processing long sequences, here are some key insights and methods from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Architectures\n\n### Nova: Hierarchical Attention for Assembly Code\nThe Nova model introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism that can be adapted for general language models. This mechanism involves:\n- **Intra-instruction attention**: Captures the summary of each instruction.\n- **Preceding-instruction attention**: Captures the context with the preceding instruction.\n- **Inter-instruction attention**: Learns long dependencies across instructions.\n\nThis hierarchical approach can be generalized to process long sequences in language models by breaking down the attention into different levels of granularity, ensuring both local and global context are captured.\n\n### Multilevel Attention-Based Transformers (MATNet)\nMATNet uses a multilevel attention network capable of extracting features at multiple levels, which can be applied to language models to handle long sequences efficiently. This approach involves processing global and local features simultaneously, which is crucial for maintaining both local and global context.\n\n## Efficient State Management\n\n### Block-Wise Processing\nTo manage state efficiently in long sequences, block-wise processing is a promising approach. This involves splitting the sequence into blocks and applying different attention mechanisms within and between blocks. For example, using conventional attention within blocks and linear attention between blocks can reduce computational complexity and memory requirements.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\nHybrid approaches that combine conventional and linear attention mechanisms can help in balancing efficiency with expressiveness. This includes using linear attention for inter-block calculations and conventional attention for intra-block calculations, which helps in maintaining key properties of traditional attention such as low-entropy \"spiky\" attention distributions and dot-product monotonicity.\n\n### Tiling Strategies and Hardware-Aware Implementations\nEfficient state management also involves tiling strategies for hardware utilization and IO-aware implementations. These strategies ensure that the model can process long sequences without significant memory overhead and maintain stable gradient computation.\n\n## Combining Local and Global Context\n\n### Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)\nAlthough the h-GNN is designed for image matching, its hierarchical clustering and message-passing mechanisms can inspire hierarchical attention architectures in LMs. The approach of successively stacking multiple compressed-size graphs and using bottom-up and top-down message propagation can be adapted to combine local and global context in language models.\n\n### Ladderpath Approach\nThe Ladderpath approach, which characterizes hierarchical structures in neural networks, suggests that optimal functionality is achieved when the network exhibits a rich hierarchical structure. This implies that language models should aim for a balanced hierarchical structure to efficiently process both local and global context.\n\n## Key Insights for Future Design\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Implement hierarchical attention mechanisms that capture semantics at different levels of granularity, similar to Nova's approach.\n- **Hybrid Attention**: Combine conventional and linear attention mechanisms to achieve linear complexity while maintaining key properties of traditional attention.\n- **Block-Wise Processing**: Use block-wise processing to reduce computational and memory requirements, ensuring efficient state management.\n- **Hardware-Aware Implementations**: Optimize the model for hardware utilization and IO efficiency to handle long sequences without significant overhead.\n- **Balanced Hierarchical Structure**: Ensure the model's hierarchical structure is balanced to optimize functionality, as suggested by the Ladderpath approach.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that efficiently process long sequences, maintain a balance between local and global context, and achieve better overall performance.\n",

One particular type of such attention, called multi-head scaled dot-product attention, is one of the main components of the Transformer architecture proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017), which has been shown to push the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for various understanding and generation tasks. These include standard natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, document classification, entailment, summarization and question answering (Zaheer et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019; Baevski and Auli, 2019), as well as music generation (Huang et al., 2018), image generation (Parmar et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020) and genomics (Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020). The Transformer is also the backbone architecture for models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) (and its numerous relatives) and GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which have delivered impressive performance across many NLP tasks. However, the standard attention mechanism of the Transformer has a run time and memory usage that scales quadratically with sequence length. Therefore, this quadratic complexity has become a critical bottleneck in processing long sequences (over 1,000 tokens), and has since motivated many new attention algorithms, see (Tay et al., 2020d) for a survey of such work. In this paper, we draw inspiration from two branches in numerical analysis: Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000) and Multigrid method (Briggs et al., 2000). We propose a hierarchical attention that has linear complexity in run time and memory, and only utilizes dense linear algebra operations optimized for GPUs or TPUs. We hypothesize that the inductive bias embodied by the proposed hierarchical structure for the attention matrix is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typically seen in many natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The main benchmark we use in this paper is the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020c), which has been specifically designed to evaluate and compare various sub-quadratic attention algorithms. Our new hierarchical attention mechanism achieves best average performance to-date on the LRA benchmark by more than 6 points over the previous-best BigBird algorithm (Zaheer et al., 2020), while pushing SOTA performance higher\nin 4 of the 5 successful tasks. Furthermore, using this new attention, a Transformer-based language model trained on the One-Billion Word dataset (Chelba et al., 2014) sets a new SOTA performance record by reducing the test perplexity by 1.55 points comparing to the previousbest Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) with 5x more parameters. Overall, these empirical results both validate the soundness of our approximation method for computing attention weights, as well as the the appropriateness of the inductive bias present in the proposed hierarchical attention. ## 2 Related Works\n\nIt is well established in the NLP literature that the embeddings of nearby tokens tend to be more similar than the distant ones (Manning and Sch\u00fctze, 1999). This leads to the intuition that token similarity and hence the attention should decrease with the sequence distance between a query token and a key token ${ }^{1}$. This motivates the sliding-window local attention (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019) which amounts to truncating off-diagonal entries in the attention matrix beyond a user-specified sequence distance. A second approach is to keep $O(1)$ number of nonzeros per row in the attention matrix. The nonzero entry selection is either content-based (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020), handcrafted (Beltagy et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019) or simply random (Zaheer et al., 2020). It is also well known in the NLP literature that long-range contextual information is necessary for many NLP tasks (Khandelwal et al., 2018; Liu and Lapata, 2019). So a set of global tokens are also considered. This adds $O(1)$ number of dense rows and columns to the attention matrix (Zaheer et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). A third approach is to approximate the attention matrix with a lowrank factored form (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a). The first two approaches are based on the premise that one needs to explicitly zero out entries in the attention matrix in order to reduce the quadratic complexity. Decades of\n\n[^0]research by the scientific computing and numerical analysis community has resulted in more sophisticated algorithms to sparsify matrices. A small set of samples of these algorithms and their engineering applications include Fast Multipole Method (Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987; Greengard, 1994; Nabors et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1998), Pre-corrected FFT (Phillips and White, 1997; Zhu et al., 2005), Hierarchical Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Kapur and Long, 1997) and Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000; Zhu and White, 2005). These are generally called Multilevel Methods (Brandt and Lubrecht, 1990). The hierarchical attention proposed in this paper is inspired by these Multilevel Methods in general and the H-Matrix in particular. The hierarchical matrix structure allows a linear complexity in both constructing and applying the attention matrix. ## 3 Definition and Notation\n\nGiven matrices $Q, K$ and $V$, with rows representing sequences of token embedding or feature vectors for query, key and value respectively, the output weighted by the scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is defined as\n\n$$\nZ=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $Z, Q, K, V \\in R^{L \\times d}, L$ is the length of the sequences, and $d$ is the embedding or feature size. In a more compact matrix form, Eq. (1) can be written as\n\n$$\nZ=D^{-1} A V\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA & =e^{S} \\\\\nS_{i, j} & =\\frac{Q_{i} K_{j}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}} \\\\\nD & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left\\{A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}\\right\\} \\\\\n1_{L} & =[1,1, \\ldots, 1]^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $A, S \\in R^{L \\times L}, \\mathbf{1}_{L} \\in R^{L}$ is a vector with all ones, and $S_{i, j}$ represents the unnormalized cosine similarity between query embedding $Q_{i}$ (the $i$-th row in $Q$ ) and key embedding $K_{j}$ (the $j$-th row in $K)$. For the sake of clarity, we focus on the singlehead attention in the exposition of the proposed\nalgorithm. Extension to the multi-head case is straightforward since each attention head is computed independently (Vaswani et al., 2017). Computing the similarity matrix $S$ in Eq. (4) and the attention matrix $A$ in Eq. (3) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ memory. Similarly, computing $A V$ in Eq. (2) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time, and computing $A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}$ in Eq. (5) takes $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ time. The $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexities are the bottlenecks for applying the attention mechanism over very long sequences. ## 4 Introduction on H-Matrix and Multigrid Method\n\n### 4.1 H-Matrix\n\nThe singular-value decomposition of the attention matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n#### 3. Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference. To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py).

Score: 0.13)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/51 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\n(2020), but the elementwise operations in the recurrent update cannot make use of tensor cores and result in low arithmetic intensity. Hence, while the recurrent form generally has the lowest total FLOPs among the three forms, this does not translate to actual wall-time efficiency. And while it is theoretically possible to parallelize linear recurrences via the parallel scan algorithm, this method requires materializing the 2D hidden state for each time step. This incurs a significant memory I/O burden, thereby offsetting the benefits of parallelism over the sequence length and resulting in slow actual running speeds, as in Katsch (2023). Parallel form. The parallel form could be as efficient as FlashAttention using similar I/O optimization techniques, as demonstrated by Qin et al. (2023b). However, the high number of FLOPs (due to the quadratic complexity) makes the long-sequence training expensive, the same issue that the na\u00efve implementation of softmax attention would suffer from. Chunkwise form. The chunkwise parallel form, which interpolates between the parallel and recurrent forms with an extra \"parameter\" $C$, makes it possible to more easily make the above tradeoffs for fine-grained optimization. Unlike the recurrent form, most operations can be done via matmuls, enabling the use of tensor cores (if $C$ is set to a multiple of 16). Though the chunkwise training algorithm has been discussed before in the literature (Hua et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023a), most implementations are not I/O-aware and thus slower than FlaShATtENTION for moderate sequence lengths (e.g., 2K-4K). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=622&width=663&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=257)\n\nFigure 1: (a) FLASHLINEARATTENTION without materialization. This version is more memory-efficient. (b-c) FlASHLINEARATTENTION with materialization. This version enables sequence-level chunkwise parallelism. ### 3.3 FlashLinearAttention: Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention with the Chunkwise Form\n\nWe describe our I/O-aware, hardware-efficient implementation of the chunkwise form. We give two versions, whose forward and backward passes differ depending on whether the chunk-level hidden states $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ are materialized in HBM. See Alg. 1 and Fig. 1 for the forward pass. (Alg. 2 in the appendix describes the backward pass.) At a high level, we use tiling to load tensors block-by-block and re-use tensor blocks on chip to avoid multiple HBM I/O as much as possible. For example, when $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ is loaded to SRAM, both $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{S}$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{K}_{[n]}^{\\top} \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_{[n]}$ can be computed on chip, which avoids loading $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ twice, thus saving HBM I/O. The non-materialization version computes $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ sequentially for $n \\in[N]$, using SRAM to temporarily store $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$, which is memory-efficient. This version parallelizes across batch size, number of heads, and head dimensions, but lacks sequence-level parallelim. When the batch size is large, this level of parallelism is sufficient to enable high GPU occupancy. In long-sequence and large scale training settings where batch size is small, the SMs cannot be fully exploited in this case. The materialization version first performs the inter-chunk recurrence (Eq. 2) and stores all $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ for $n \\in[N]$ in HBM. Then, the $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ 's can be computed in parallel for all chunks. This approach offers better parallelism but increases the memory footprint by approximately 10-20\\%. We mitigate this through recomputation, where the hidden states discarded after the forward pass and recomputed during the backward pass. We find this introduces a small runtime overhead but significantly reduces the memory footprint, and we adopt this strategy by default. Figure 2 shows the speed and memory footprint of our implementation. Both versions of FLASHLINEARATTENTION are substantially faster than FlASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=475&width=811&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2: Speed comparison on a single H100 GPU with batch size 32 , number of heads 16 , head dimension 64 , and chunk size 64.\n```\n\n#### 5. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

It categorizes attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming Heads, which helps in optimizing memory usage and processing speed. Retrieval Heads maintain a full Key-Value (KV) cache for long-term context, while Streaming Heads use a reduced, constant-length cache for recent tokens. This approach ensures that the model retains crucial context information while minimizing computational load.\n\n### Hierarchical Self-Attention in Nova\nNova uses a hierarchical self-attention mechanism designed to capture low-information-density semantics in long sequences of assembly code. This involves creating per-statement attention labels and using preceding-instruction and inter-instruction attention to capture semantics at different granularity levels. This hierarchical approach can be adapted for other types of sequences to improve efficiency and performance.\n\n## Memory Optimization\n\n### Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\nThe concept of heterogeneous context sharding among attention heads, as described in the S2-Attention architecture, is highly effective. Each attention head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context. This approach ensures strong performance on long-context tasks while achieving significant speed-ups in both training and inference. It also optimizes memory access patterns and hardware utilization.\n\n### Efficient Memory Management with DuoAttention\nDuoAttention reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7 for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models and 1.67\u00d7 for GQA models. It achieves this through adaptive allocation of memory to only the most critical attention heads, ensuring minimal memory usage without compromising the model's ability to understand complex contexts.\n\n## Hardware Utilization and Optimization\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer self-attention. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing latency and power consumption. The design involves mapping matrices to memristor crossbar arrays and using RRAM-based compare and select logics for softmax calculations, which can lead to substantial efficiency gains in hardware implementation.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Tiling and Blocking\nThe S2-Attention architecture emphasizes the importance of designing sparse attention mechanisms with hardware and software systems in mind. This includes using hardware-friendly sparse attention patterns and optimizing memory IO, which can lead to wall-clock speed-ups and improved efficiency in both training and inference.\n\n## Integration and Balancing Strategies\n\n### Combining Local and Global Attention\nAlternating attention mechanisms, such as those in the Zebra model, balance local and global attention layers. This approach reduces computational requirements and memory consumption while maintaining or improving performance on both short and long sequence benchmarks[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nCombining sparse and dense attention, as seen in the S2-Attention architecture, balances efficiency and performance. This hybrid design ensures that the model has direct access to all tokens at certain layers, which is crucial for strong performance on challenging long-context tasks.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of memory and computational resources but also highly performant and scalable:\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: Implement hierarchical attention mechanisms like DuoAttention and Nova's hierarchical self-attention to capture context at different granularity levels efficiently.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Use context sharding among attention heads and adaptive memory allocation to minimize memory usage.\n- **Hardware Utilization**: Leverage memristor-based acceleration and hardware-aware tiling and blocking to optimize for hardware efficiency.\n- **Integration Strategies**: Combine local and global attention mechanisms and use hybrid architectures to balance efficiency and performance.\n\nThese strategies collectively address the goals of reducing memory usage, speeding up processing, and ensuring scalability and robustness in autoregressive language models.\n",

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling? (Avg. Score: 0.26)\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/28 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 29, 2016.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2.

In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Adaptive RMSNorm\" \"Multi-scale Normalization\" \"Adaptive Computation Language Models\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Adaptive RMSNorm\" \"Multi-scale Normalization\" \"Adaptive Computation Language Models\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Adaptive RMSNorm\" \"Multi-scale Normalization\" \"Adaptive Computation Language Models\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and validating the **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm (HARN)** block for language models, here are some key insights and recommendations based on the provided analysis and external sources:\n\n### Hierarchical and Adaptive Normalization\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: The concept of multi-scale normalization in HARN is crucial for capturing hierarchical relationships within data.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n1. **Complementary Optimization Strategies:**\n   - The **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** study removes MatMul operations to enhance efficiency, while HARN introduces hierarchical and adaptive normalization techniques. Combining these strategies could potentially lead to even more efficient and scalable language models.\n\n2. **Hierarchical and Adaptive Normalization:**\n   - HARN's multi-scale normalization allows the model to process information at various granularities, improving its ability to capture hierarchical relationships within data. This hierarchical approach is distinct from the MatMul-free optimization but can complement it by ensuring that the model remains expressive and effective across different scales.\n\n3. **Adaptive Computation Based on Input Complexity:**\n   - By dynamically adjusting normalization parameters based on input complexity, HARN ensures that computational resources are allocated efficiently. This adaptive mechanism is crucial for handling long sequences, as it prevents resource wastage on simple patterns and enhances performance on complex ones.\n\n4. **Hardware-Aware Optimizations and Memory Management:**\n   - HARN's focus on hardware-aware optimizations and efficient memory management is essential for real-world applications where hardware constraints are significant. Understanding the best practices in this area, as exemplified by the internal search result, can inform the practical implementation of HARN.\n\n5. **Novelty and Research Gap:**\n   - While existing studies focus on different aspects of optimization (e.g., eliminating MatMul), HARN addresses a unique combination of hierarchical and adaptive normalization within the RMSNorm framework. This suggests a novel contribution to the field, provided that similar integrations have not been previously explored.\n\n---\n\n#### **6.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Adaptive RMSNorm\" \"Multi-scale Normalization\" \"Adaptive Computation Language Models\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Adaptive RMSNorm\" \"Multi-scale Normalization\" \"Adaptive Computation Language Models\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2.

However, from another point of\nview, it can also be seen as a modulating mechanism between the input and the\noutput, with the input scaled by a pre-defined value one. In this work, we\ninvestigate how the scale factors in the effectiveness of the skip connection\nand reveal that a trivial adjustment of the scale will lead to spurious\ngradient exploding or vanishing in line with the deepness of the models, which\ncould be addressed by normalization, in particular, layer normalization, which\ninduces consistent improvements over the plain skip connection. Inspired by the\nfindings, we further propose to adaptively adjust the scale of the input by\nrecursively applying skip connection with layer normalization, which promotes\nthe performance substantially and generalizes well across diverse tasks\nincluding both machine translation and image classification datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-15T11:44:49Z  (*Updated: 2021-05-15T11:44:49Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of developing and validating the **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm (HARN)** block, here are some key points and recommendations based on the provided analysis and search results:\n\n### Understanding the Goal and Intent\n\nThe researcher aims to design a novel autoregressive language model block, HARN, which integrates hierarchical processing, adaptive computation, and multi-scale normalization to enhance efficiency, performance, and scalability.

Eshraghian*\n\n   **Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)  \n   **Cited by:** 3  \n   **TL;DR:** This work demonstrates that Matrix Multiplication (MatMul) operations can be entirely eliminated from large language models (LLMs) while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. The study focuses on optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency by removing MatMul, aligning with HARN's goals to enhance efficiency and scalability in language models.\n\n   **Abstract Excerpt:**\n   > \"Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. ... This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\"\n\n**External Sources Found:**\n\n1. **Root Mean Square Layer Normalization**\n   \n   *Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n   **Published in:** arXiv.org (2019)  \n   **Cited by:** 1  \n   **Abstract Excerpt:**\n   > \"Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g., RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

This paper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process, examining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors in the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is innately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step in LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component of a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and (iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation space. ... Our findings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more computationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also learns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal to the uniform vector.\"\n\n3. **Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition**\n   \n   *Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n   **Published in:** arXiv.org (2017-07-19)  \n   **Cited by:** 1  \n   **Abstract Excerpt:**\n   > \"Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the activities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and stability.

The experimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms of transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and environments.\"\n\n**Integration and Analysis of Search Results:**\n\n1. **Alignment with Efficiency and Scalability Goals:**\n   - The internal search result on **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** aligns with HARN's objectives to enhance efficiency and scalability. Both approaches aim to optimize fundamental components of language models to reduce computational overhead. While **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** focuses on eliminating MatMul operations, HARN targets normalization enhancements, suggesting complementary optimization strategies.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Processing and Multi-Scale Normalization:**\n   - The external search results on **Root Mean Square Layer Normalization** and **Re-Introducing LayerNorm** provide foundational insights into RMSNorm and its properties. These studies highlight RMSNorm's computational efficiency over LayerNorm and delve into geometric interpretations, respectively. HARN's incorporation of hierarchical and multi-scale normalization can build upon these findings, offering a more nuanced approach to normalization that captures hierarchical relationships within data.\n\n3. **Adaptive Computation Mechanisms:**\n   - The **Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition** introduces DLN, which dynamically adjusts normalization parameters based on input variability. This concept parallels HARN's adaptive computation, where normalization parameters are adjusted based on input complexity. Both aim to allocate computational resources more effectively, enhancing model performance in varying contexts.\n\n4. **Novelty and Research Gap:**\n   - While adaptive computation and hierarchical normalization have been explored individually, HARN's integration of both within the RMSNorm framework appears to be a novel approach. The comparative studies on LayerNorm and RMSNorm indicate that enhancing RMSNorm with hierarchical and adaptive mechanisms has not been extensively investigated, positioning HARN to fill this research gap.\n\n5. **Hardware-Aware Optimizations and Memory Management:**\n   - The findings from **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** suggest optimizing hardware utilization by eliminating computationally intensive operations.

Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face significant challenges in efficiently processing long sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and model quality. While RMSNorm provides effective normalization, it lacks mechanisms to adapt to varying input complexities and optimize computation across different scales of the input sequence.
