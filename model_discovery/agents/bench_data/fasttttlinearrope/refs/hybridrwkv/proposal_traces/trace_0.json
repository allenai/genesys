Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1. Linear Attention\n\nLinear Transformer architectures discard the Softmax Attention mechanism, replacing it with distinct approximations (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b;a).

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention efficient transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Modeling Context With Linear Attention for Scalable Document-Level Translation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient transformers*\n\n*Zhaofeng Wu, Hao Peng, Nikolaos Pappas, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the efficacy of a recent linear attention model on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias and shows that sentential gating further improves translation quality on IWSLT.\n\n**Abstract:** Document-level machine translation leverages inter-sentence dependencies to produce more coherent and consistent translations. However, these models, predominantly based on transformers, are difficult to scale to long documents as their attention layers have quadratic complexity in the sequence length. Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias. We evaluate the model on IWSLT 2015 and OpenSubtitles 2018 against the transformer, demonstrating substantially increased decoding speed on long sequences with similar or better BLEU scores. We show that sentential gating further improves translation quality on IWSLT.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient transformers*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. ScatterFormer: Efficient Voxel Transformer with Scattered Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient transformers*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Guowen Zhang, Ruihuang Li, Chenhang He*\n\n**Abstract:** Window-based transformers excel in large-scale point cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, the sparse nature of point clouds leads to a significant variance in the number of voxels per window. Existing methods group the voxels in each window into fixed-length sequences through extensive sorting and padding operations, resulting in a non-negligible computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce ScatterFormer, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first to directly apply attention to voxels across different windows as a single sequence. The key of ScatterFormer is a Scattered Linear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the pre-computation of key-value pairs in linear attention to enable parallel computation on the variable-length voxel sequences divided by windows. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of GPUs and shared memory, we propose a chunk-wise algorithm that reduces the SLA module's latency to less than 1 millisecond on moderate GPUs. Furthermore, we develop a cross-window interaction module that improves the locality and connectivity of voxel features across different windows, eliminating the need for extensive window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer demonstrates 73.8 mAP (L2) on the Waymo Open Dataset and 72.4 NDS on the NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 23 FPS.The code is available at \\href{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient transformers*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Yehui Tang, Xinghao Chen, Jialong Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using linear attention mechanisms, focusing on computational efficiency and expressiveness trade-offs, here are some key findings and implementations from recent research:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficient Linear Attention in Transformers\nThe paper on \"Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time\" introduces a method to make linear attention more efficient and learnable. It shows that linear attention can be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), allowing for polynomial-time learnability of single-layer Transformers with linear attention. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, making them more efficient and generalizable.\n\n### Linear DiT in Sana Framework\nThe Sana framework replaces vanilla attention in Decoder-in-Transformer (DiT) models with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. This linear DiT reduces the computational complexity from \\(O(N^2)\\) to \\(O(N)\\), making it particularly efficient for generating high-resolution images. Additionally, the use of Mix-FFN (a combination of feed-forward networks and depth-wise convolution) enhances local information processing without needing positional encoding.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe introduction of a memristor-based hardware accelerator for transformer self-attention significantly improves computational efficiency. This design leverages in-memory computing to perform matrix operations analogously, reducing power consumption and latency. For instance, the proposed design shows a power consumption of \\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\) and a latency of \\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\), which is much more efficient than previous designs.\n\n### ProbSparse Self-Attention\nThe Attention-Linear model uses ProbSparse self-attention, which has a computational complexity of \\(O(L \\log L)\\) for sequence length \\(L\\). This mechanism is more efficient than traditional self-attention, especially for long sequences, and it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction tasks.\n\n## Expressiveness and Hybrid Approaches\n\n### Combining Attention Mechanisms\nThe analysis of the parent designs (RWKV6 and FastTTTLinear) suggests combining different attention mechanisms. For example, integrating RWKV6's multi-headed approach with FastTTTLinear's gated linear attention could create a hybrid attention mechanism that preserves the benefits of both. This combination could enhance expressivity while maintaining efficiency.\n\n### Dynamic Recurrence and State Management\nRWKV6's dynamic recurrence mechanism and matrix-valued states can be integrated with FastTTTLinear's test-time training approach to improve state management and adaptation capabilities. This hybrid approach could offer better expressivity and efficiency by leveraging the strengths of both architectures.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo improve autoregressive language model design, the following strategies are promising:\n\n- **Adopt Linear Attention**: Implement linear attention mechanisms, such as those in the Sana framework or the polynomial-time learnable linear attention, to reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency.\n- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilize memristor-based or other efficient hardware accelerators to enhance the performance of self-attention mechanisms.\n- **Hybrid Attention**: Combine different attention mechanisms, such as multi-headed and gated linear attention, to balance expressivity and efficiency.\n- **Dynamic State Management**: Integrate dynamic recurrence mechanisms and matrix-valued states to enhance state management and adaptation capabilities.\n\nThese approaches can help in creating more efficient, expressive, and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code ${ }^{1}$ and pre-trained model checkpoints ${ }^{2}$ are publicly available. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Attention Mechanism\n\nSuppose the input to the layer is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the embedding dimension, then the attention mechanism outputs\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$. Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. To facilitate modeling discrete data, the model in Eq. 2 can be discretized (using the bilinear method) by a step size $\\Delta$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1}(\\mathbf{I}+\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\\\\n& \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\Delta \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe unroll the above recurrent representation, after which we have\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\cdots+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as a convolutional representation $y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u$, where the convolution kernel\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\cdots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" is the discrete convolution operator, $u$ represents the input sequence $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, and $y$ represents the corresponding output sequence $\\left(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{L}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 2. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

(2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training.

However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/32 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\n## 2. Background\n\n### 2.1. Self Attention\n\nIf we have an input $\\mathbf{X}$ that belongs to $\\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ represents sequence length and $d$ represents the embedding dimension, the attention mechanism produces pair-wise scores denoted as $\\mathbf{M}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{M}=\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights, and $\\sigma$ is the attention function. Denote the attention matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L} . \\mathbf{M}_{i j}$ captures the relations between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. Linear attention Taking Norm as $\\sigma$ (Qin et al., 2024), to take advantage of the computational efficiency inherent in right matrix multiplication, the attention score $\\mathbf{M}$ can be transformed into its linear variant, which is mathematically equivalent due to the properties of matrix multiplication. $$\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\text {linear }}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n### 2.2. Linear Recurrent Models\n\nContinuous formulation. A model with a continuous time latent space transforms a one-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ into a latent state $x(t)$ that has $d_{s}$ dimensions, and then this $x(t)$ is transformed into a one-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Clearly, we can define the process:\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Eq. 3 is utilized in prior research to model long sequences. For instance, Gu et al. (2020a) suggests a set of matrices called HiPPO (high-order polynomial projection operators) to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are constructed to enable the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ to remember the history of the input $u(t)$ up to the present.\n```\n\n#### 4.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Algorithm and Hardness for Dynamic Attention Maintenance in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models*\n\n*Jan van den Brand, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false, and there is no algorithm that can use both the amortized update time and the worst-case query time of the proposed algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have made fundamental changes in human life. The attention scheme is one of the key components over all the LLMs, such as BERT, GPT-1, Transformers, GPT-2, 3, 3.5 and 4. Inspired by previous theoretical study of static version of the attention multiplication problem [Zandieh, Han, Daliri, and Karbasi arXiv 2023, Alman and Song arXiv 2023]. In this work, we formally define a dynamic version of attention matrix multiplication problem. There are matrices $Q,K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, they represent query, key and value in LLMs. In each iteration we update one entry in $K$ or $V$. In the query stage, we receive $(i,j) \\in [n] \\times [d]$ as input, and want to answer $(D^{-1} A V)_{i,j}$, where $A:=\\exp(QK^\\top) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a square matrix and $D := \\mathrm{diag}(A {\\bf 1}_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix. Here ${\\bf 1}_n$ denote a length-$n$ vector that all the entries are ones. We provide two results: an algorithm and a conditional lower bound. $\\bullet$ On one hand, inspired by the lazy update idea from [Demetrescu and Italiano FOCS 2000, Sankowski FOCS 2004, Cohen, Lee and Song STOC 2019, Brand SODA 2020], we provide a data-structure that uses $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau)-\\tau})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau})$ worst-case query time. $\\bullet$ On the other hand, show that unless the hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture [Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak FOCS 2019] is false, there is no algorithm that can use both $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau) - \\tau- \\Omega(1)})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau-\\Omega(1)})$ worst query time. In conclusion, our algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. DT-Solver: Automated Theorem Proving with Dynamic-Tree Sampling Guided by Proof-level Value Function\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models*\n\n*Haiming Wang, Ye Yuan, Zhengying Liu, Jianhao Shen, Yichun Yin, Jing Xiong, Enze Xie, Han Shi, Yujun Li, Lin Li, Jian Yin, Zhenguo Li, Xiaodan Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Dynamic-Tree Driven Theorem Solver (DT-Solver) is proposed, which introduces a dynamic-tree Monte-Carlo search algorithm, which dynamically allocates computing budgets for different state confidences, guided by a new proof-level value function to discover proof states that require substantial exploration.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in neural theorem-proving resort to large language models and tree searches. When proving a theorem, a language model advises single-step actions based on the current proving state and the tree search finds a sequence of correct steps using actions given by the language model. However, prior works often conduct constant computation efforts for each proving state while ignoring that the hard states often need more exploration than easy states. Moreover, they evaluate and guide the proof search solely depending on the current proof state instead of considering the whole proof trajectory as human reasoning does. Here, to accommodate general theorems, we propose a novel Dynamic-Tree Driven Theorem Solver (DT-Solver) by guiding the search procedure with state confidence and proof-level values. Specifically, DT-Solver introduces a dynamic-tree Monte-Carlo search algorithm, which dynamically allocates computing budgets for different state confidences, guided by a new proof-level value function to discover proof states that require substantial exploration.Experiments on two popular theorem-proving datasets, PISA and Mathlib, show significant performance gains by our DT-Solver over the state-of-the-art approaches, with a 6.65% improvement on average in terms of success rate. And especially under low computing resource settings (11.03% improvement on average).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. LaMemo: Language Modeling with Look-Ahead Memory\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models*\n\n*Haozhe Ji, Rongsheng Zhang, Zhenyu Yang, Zhipeng Hu, Minlie Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Look-Ahead Memory (LaMemo) is proposed that enhances the recurrence memory by incrementally attending to the right-side tokens and interpolating with the old memory states to maintain long-term information in the history.\n\n**Abstract:** Although Transformers with fully connected self-attentions are powerful to model long-term dependencies, they are struggling to scale to long texts with thousands of words in language modeling. One of the solutions is to equip the model with a recurrence memory. However, existing approaches directly reuse hidden states from the previous segment that encodes contexts in a uni-directional way. As a result, this prohibits the memory to dynamically interact with the current context that provides up-to-date information for token prediction. To remedy this issue, we propose Look-Ahead Memory (LaMemo) that enhances the recurrence memory by incrementally attending to the right-side tokens and interpolating with the old memory states to maintain long-term information in the history. LaMemo embraces bi-directional attention and segment recurrence with an additional computation overhead only linearly proportional to the memory length. Experiments on widely used language modeling benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over the baselines equipped with different types of memory mechanisms.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. VISIT: Visualizing and Interpreting the Semantic Information Flow of Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence language models*\n\n*Shahar Katz, Yonatan Belinkov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates LM attention heads and memory values, the vectors the models dynamically create and recall while processing a given input, and creates a tool to visualize a forward pass of Generative Pre-trained Transformers as an interactive flow graph.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in interpretability suggest we can project weights and hidden states of transformer-based language models (LMs) to their vocabulary, a transformation that makes them more human interpretable. In this paper, we investigate LM attention heads and memory values, the vectors the models dynamically create and recall while processing a given input. By analyzing the tokens they represent through this projection, we identify patterns in the information flow inside the attention mechanism. Based on our discoveries, we create a tool to visualize a forward pass of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) as an interactive flow graph, with nodes representing neurons or hidden states and edges representing the interactions between them. Our visualization simplifies huge amounts of data into easy-to-read plots that can reflect the models' internal processing, uncovering the contribution of each component to the models' final prediction. Our visualization also unveils new insights about the role of layer norms as semantic filters that influence the models' output, and about neurons that are always activated during forward passes and act as regularization vectors.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the interaction of matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence mechanisms with attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and implementations from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Matrix-Valued States in Language Models\n\n- The concept of matrix-valued states is closely related to the Selective State Space Model (Mamba) mentioned in the arXiv paper. Mamba updates its hidden state using specialized trainable linear layers that map the input to dynamic time-variant matrices. This approach allows for efficient handling of sequence data by conditioning the state updates based on the current input.\n\n## Dynamic Recurrence Mechanisms\n\n- Dynamic recurrence mechanisms are crucial in models like Mamba and S4. Mamba employs selective parameters to update its hidden state dynamically, balancing memory and recall efficiency. This mechanism is key to handling long-range dependencies without the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n- S4, another state-space model, uses the Higher-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO) and a diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) parametrization to stabilize the state-space matrix. This allows S4 to efficiently memorize signal history and handle long-range dependencies, which is beneficial for autoregressive models.\n\n## Interaction with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Integrating matrix-valued states with attention mechanisms can be seen in the context of hybrid models. For instance, combining the matrix-valued states of RWKV6 with linear attention mechanisms could enhance block processing efficiency. RWKV6's matrix-valued states can potentially improve the handling of intra-block and inter-block attention by leveraging the dynamic recurrence mechanisms to update the state matrices.\n\n- The use of tiling techniques and separate handling of intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention, as mentioned in \"Lightning Attention-2,\" can be integrated with dynamic recurrence mechanisms to maintain constant training speed across sequence lengths. This approach ensures that the model can efficiently process long sequences while preserving temporal dependencies.\n\n## Preserving Temporal Dependencies\n\n- Preserving temporal dependencies is critical for autoregressive generation. The findings from \"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding\" highlight the need for careful handling of temporal dependencies when applying linear attention methods to autoregressive models. Hybrid approaches that combine conventional attention with linear attention can help mitigate these issues.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n- Techniques like test-time training adaptation, as seen in FastTTTLinear, can improve the dynamic behavior of the model. Integrating this with block-based attention and matrix-valued states can enhance the model's performance and efficiency. Additionally, ensuring I/O-awareness and optimizing cumsum operations are crucial for practical speed gains.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design:\n\n- **Use dynamic recurrence mechanisms** like those in Mamba and S4 to efficiently update matrix-valued states based on the input.\n- **Integrate hybrid attention mechanisms** that combine conventional and linear attention to preserve temporal dependencies and optimize performance.\n- **Employ tiling techniques and I/O-awareness** to ensure efficient processing of long sequences.\n- **Optimize cumsum operations and state updates** to maintain constant training speed and improve overall efficiency.\n\nThese approaches can help in designing a more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",

On one hand, the main advantage of RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8 k . On the other hand, once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of the extra information being conditioned on. The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention, RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,\nthe update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We introduce two simple instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention. Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already efficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical innovations to make it efficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than $5 \\times$ faster. As shown in Figure 3, TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8 k context and matches Mamba. Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following the Chinchilla recipe [34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.\n```\n\n#### 2. Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA), is proposed, introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/30 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Editing Factual Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Nicola De Cao, Wilker Aziz, Ivan Titov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents KnowledgeEditor, a method which can be used to edit factual knowledge and, thus, fix \u2018bugs\u2019 or unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The factual knowledge acquired during pre-training and stored in the parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g., question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix \u2018bugs\u2019 or unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning). In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show KnowledgeEditor\u2019s efficacy with two popular architectures and knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method, changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated) paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded as a \u2018probe\u2019 revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated on a small subset of components.

OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster. Notably, our work considers models with tens of billions of parameters, which is up to $100\\times$ larger than what has been previously considered in the structured pruning literature.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Reconsidering the Past: Optimizing Hidden States in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Davis Yoshida, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hidden-State Optimization is presented, a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time that computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Hidden-State Optimization (HSO), a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time. Similar to dynamic evaluation (Krause et al., 2018), HSO computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text, but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters. We test HSO with pretrained Transformer-XL and GPT-2 language models, finding improvement on the WikiText103 and PG-19 datasets in terms of perplexity, especially when evaluating a model outside of its training distribution. We also demonstrate downstream applicability by showing gains in the recently developed prompt-based few-shot evaluation setting, again with no extra parameters or training data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. CRoFT: Robust Fine-Tuning with Concurrent Optimization for OOD Generalization and Open-Set OOD Detection\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Lin Zhu, Yifeng Yang, Qinying Gu, Xinbing Wang, Cheng Zhou, Nanyang Ye*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that minimizing the gradient magnitude of energy scores on training data leads to domain-consistent Hessians of classification loss, a strong indicator for OOD generalization revealed by theoretical analysis and a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for concurrent optimization of both tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent vision-language pre-trained models (VL-PTMs) have shown remarkable success in open-vocabulary tasks. However, downstream use cases often involve further fine-tuning of VL-PTMs, which may distort their general knowledge and impair their ability to handle distribution shifts. In real-world scenarios, machine learning systems inevitably encounter both covariate shifts (e.g., changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on covariate shifts and simultaneously detecting semantic-shifted unseen classes. Thus a critical but underexplored question arises: How to improve VL-PTMs' generalization ability to closed-set OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set unseen classes during fine-tuning? In this paper, we propose a novel objective function of OOD detection that also serves to improve OOD generalization. We show that minimizing the gradient magnitude of energy scores on training data leads to domain-consistent Hessians of classification loss, a strong indicator for OOD generalization revealed by theoretical analysis. Based on this finding, we have developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for concurrent optimization of both tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

Distributionally Robust Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Shiori Sagawa, Pang Wei Koh, Tatsunori B. Hashimoto, Percy Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results suggest that regularization is critical for worst-group performance in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average performance, and introduce and provide convergence guarantees for a stochastic optimizer for this group DRO setting.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks trained to minimize average loss can be highly accurate on average on an i.i.d. test set, yet consistently fail on atypical groups of the data (e.g., by learning spurious correlations that do not hold at test time). Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) provides an approach for learning models that instead minimize worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups. We find, however, that naively applying DRO to overparameterized neural networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model with vanishing average training loss will also already have vanishing worst-case training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance of these models arises from poor generalization on some groups. As a solution, we show that increased regularization---e.g., stronger-than-typical weight decay or early stopping---allows DRO models to achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10% to 40% improvements over standard models on a natural language inference task and two image tasks, while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that regularization is critical for worst-group performance in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average performance. Finally, we introduce and provide convergence guarantees for a stochastic optimizer for this group DRO setting, underpinning the empirical study above.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 477  (*Influential: 119*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Rae, Erich Elsen, Karen Simonyan, Simon Osindero, Aurelia Guy, Bogdan Damoc, George van den Driessche, Katie Millican, Eric Noland, Tom Hennigan, Aidan Clark, Johannes Welbl, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Diego de Las Casas, Eliza Rutherford, Trevor Cai, Elena Buchatskaya, Arthur Mensch, Sebastian Borgeaud, Jordan Hoffmann*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over \\nummodels language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, \\chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as \\gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$ more more data. \\chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms \\Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that \\chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, \\chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\\% improvement over \\gopher.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. CAT-LM: Training Language Models on Aligned Code And Tests\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Vincent J. Hellendoorn, Claire Le Goues, Uri Alon, Kush Jain, Nikitha Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Testing is an integral part of the software development process. Yet, writing tests is time-consuming and therefore often neglected. Classical test generation tools such as EvoSuite generate behavioral test suites by optimizing for coverage, but tend to produce tests that are hard to understand. Language models trained on code can generate code that is highly similar to that written by humans, but current models are trained to generate each file separately, as is standard practice in natural language processing, and thus fail to consider the code-under-test context when producing a test file. In this work, we propose the Aligned Code And Tests Language Model (CAT-LM), a GPT-style language model with 2.7 Billion parameters, trained on a corpus of Python and Java projects. We utilize a novel pretraining signal that explicitly considers the mapping between code and test files when available. We also drastically increase the maximum sequence length of inputs to 8,192 tokens, 4x more than typical code generation models, to ensure that the code context is available to the model when generating test code. We analyze its usefulness for realistic applications, showing that sampling with filtering (e.g., by compilability, coverage) allows it to efficiently produce tests that achieve coverage similar to ones written by developers while resembling their writing style. By utilizing the code context, CAT-LM generates more valid tests than even much larger language models trained with more data (CodeGen 16B and StarCoder) and substantially outperforms a recent test-specific model (TeCo) at test completion. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating software-specific insights when training language models for code and paves the way to more powerful automated test generation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization language models*\n\n*Alexander M. Rush, Sam Wiseman*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) modeling has rapidly become an important\ngeneral-purpose NLP tool that has proven effective for many text-generation and\nsequence-labeling tasks. Seq2seq builds on deep neural language modeling and\ninherits its remarkable accuracy in estimating local, next-word distributions.\nIn this work, we introduce a model and beam-search training scheme, based on\nthe work of Daume III and Marcu (2005), that extends seq2seq to learn global\nsequence scores. This structured approach avoids classical biases associated\nwith local training and unifies the training loss with the test-time usage,\nwhile preserving the proven model architecture of seq2seq and its efficient\ntraining approach. We show that our system outperforms a highly-optimized\nattention-based seq2seq system and other baselines on three different sequence\nto sequence tasks: word ordering, parsing, and machine translation.\n\n**Conference:** sequence-to-sequence-learning-as-beam-search-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-06-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on test-time training optimization, state update mechanisms, and adaptation strategies, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Test-Time Fine-Tuning and Adaptation\n\n### Dynamic Test-Time Fine-Tuning\nThe work on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" highlights the effectiveness of test-time fine-tuning for language models. This approach involves fine-tuning the model's parameters at test time specifically for each prompt, which can significantly improve performance. The method, known as SIFT (Selective Iterative Fine-Tuning), dynamically adapts the amount of test-time compute based on the expected performance gain, making it computationally scalable.\n\n### Adaptive Test-Time Compute Allocation\nThe paper \"Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally\" discusses the importance of allocating test-time compute effectively. It introduces a \"compute-optimal\" strategy that adapts test-time compute per prompt, leading to more than a 4x improvement in efficiency compared to a best-of-N baseline. This strategy is particularly beneficial for easier prompts or settings with lower inference loads, where test-time optimization can outperform larger pre-trained models.\n\n### Test-Time Adaptation for Generalization\nThe \"Dual Prototype Evolving\" approach for vision-language models, although focused on a different domain, provides insights into test-time adaptation. This method involves evolving prototypes to capture task-specific knowledge from multi-modalities, which can be adapted to language models by focusing on textual prototypes. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize to diverse data with unlabeled test samples.\n\n## State Update Mechanisms and Adaptation Strategies\n\n### Active Fine-Tuning Data Selection\nThe SIFT method mentioned earlier also involves selecting fine-tuning data from a large dataset based on uncertainty estimates. This active fine-tuning approach ensures that the model is fine-tuned on data that is most relevant to the prompt, leading to better performance gains.\n\n### Adaptive Model Distribution Updates\nThe \"Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally\" paper discusses updating the model's distribution over responses adaptively at test time. This can be done by modifying the input prompt or using post-processing verifiers to select the best response from multiple candidates. This adaptive updating helps in improving the model's performance on challenging prompts.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations and Temporal Dependency Preservation\n\n### Efficient Test-Time Computation\nThe work on test-time fine-tuning emphasizes the need for efficient computation. By adaptively stopping the fine-tuning process based on uncertainty estimates, the method ensures that test-time compute is spent proportionally to the realized performance gains, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\n### Balancing Local and Global Information\nWhile the sources do not directly address hardware-efficient hybrid attention mechanisms in the context of language models, the general principle of balancing local and global information processing is crucial. Techniques like tiling in linear attention calculations, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be applied to optimize hardware efficiency and preserve temporal dependencies[Analysis Note].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo improve autoregressive language model design, the following strategies are recommended:\n\n- **Dynamic Test-Time Fine-Tuning**: Implement SIFT or similar methods to fine-tune the model at test time, adapting the compute based on expected performance gains.\n- **Adaptive Test-Time Compute Allocation**: Use compute-optimal strategies to allocate test-time compute effectively, especially for easier prompts or lower inference loads.\n- **Active Data Selection**: Select fine-tuning data based on uncertainty estimates to ensure the model is fine-tuned on relevant data.\n- **Adaptive Model Distribution Updates**: Update the model's distribution over responses adaptively at test time to improve performance on challenging prompts.\n- **Efficient Computation and Attention Mechanisms**: Optimize test-time computation and use techniques like tiling in linear attention to balance local and global information processing while preserving temporal dependencies[Analysis Note].\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.53)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Score: 0.46)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 5. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (Avg.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient attention implementations memory management*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient attention implementations memory management*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient attention implementations memory management*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient attention implementations memory management*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Crystalline: Fast and Memory Efficient Wait-Free Reclamation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient attention implementations memory management*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Historically, memory management based on lock-free reference counting was very inefficient, especially for read-dominated workloads. Thus, approaches such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR), hazard pointers (HP), or a combination thereof have received significant attention. EBR exhibits excellent performance but is blocking due to potentially unbounded memory usage. In contrast, HP are non-blocking and achieve good memory efficiency but are much slower. Moreover, HP are only lock-free in the general case. Recently, several new memory reclamation approaches such as WFE and Hyaline have been proposed. WFE achieves wait-freedom, but is less memory efficient and suffers from suboptimal performance in oversubscribed scenarios; Hyaline achieves higher performance and memory efficiency, but lacks wait-freedom. We present a new wait-free memory reclamation scheme, Crystalline, that simultaneously addresses the challenges of high performance, high memory efficiency, and wait-freedom. Crystalline guarantees complete wait-freedom even when threads are dynamically recycled, asynchronously reclaims memory in the sense that any thread can reclaim memory retired by any other thread, and ensures (an almost) balanced reclamation workload across all threads. The latter two properties result in Crystalline's high performance and high memory efficiency. Simultaneously ensuring all three properties require overcoming unique challenges which we discuss in the paper. Crystalline's implementation relies on specialized instructions which are widely available on commodity hardware such as x86-64 or ARM64. Our experimental evaluations show that Crystalline exhibits outstanding scalability and memory efficiency, and achieves superior throughput than typical reclamation schemes such as EBR as the number of threads grows.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient attention implementations and memory management strategies, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n### SageAttention\n- This method introduces an efficient and accurate INT8 quantization for attention mechanisms. SageAttention utilizes fused kernels combining ROPE with quantization and a fast self-attention kernel inspired by FlashAttention-style tiling. It achieves significant speedups (2.1x and 2.7x) compared to FlashAttention2 and xformers, respectively, while maintaining high accuracy. This implementation is optimized for Nvidia Tensor Core instructions, making it highly efficient for both training and inference.\n\n### S2-Attention\n- This approach involves sparse attention that shards the context heterogeneously across attention heads. Each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context. S2-Attention optimizes kernel efficiency by dynamically merging sparse query blocks that share common key-value pairs, ensuring full utilization of each tile and minimizing redundant key-value loading. This method achieves substantial speedups (up to 25.3x) compared to dense attention baselines while maintaining strong downstream performance.\n\n### Memristor-Based Attention\n- This hardware accelerator leverages memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention. It performs matrix operations in an analog manner using memristor crossbar arrays, which significantly reduces power consumption and latency. The design includes efficient softmax calculations using RRAM-based compare and select logics and lookup tables for exponential and logarithmic functions. This approach is highly energy-efficient and suitable for edge devices and high-performance computing clusters.\n\n## Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Sparse Attention\n- Sparse attention strategies, such as those implemented in S2-Attention, help in managing memory efficiently by only processing a subset of the context. This approach reduces the memory reads/writes and improves SRAM utilization, leading to significant speedups without compromising performance.\n\n### Tiling and Kernel Optimization\n- Methods like FlashAttention and SageAttention optimize memory management by tiling the Q, K, and V matrices into chunks that fit into SRAM for efficient computation. This reduces the IO between SRAM and HBM, enhancing overall efficiency.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Combining sparse and dense attention mechanisms can balance efficiency and performance. Hybrid architectures ensure that the model has direct access to all tokens at certain layers, which is crucial for long-context tasks. This approach helps in managing memory effectively while maintaining strong performance.\n\n## Efficient Gradient Computation Methods\n\n### Adaptive Quantization\n- The SageAttention method uses adaptive quantization to improve operations per second (OPS) by 12% without sacrificing accuracy. This involves using FP16 accumulators in the matrix multiplication of (P, V) to boost both accuracy and speed, which can be beneficial for efficient gradient computation.\n\n### Progressive Quantization\n- The QoQ algorithm (W4A8KV4 quantization) introduced in the QServe system optimizes gradient computation by reducing dequantization overhead. It uses progressive quantization and compute-aware weight reordering to minimize dequantization latency, which is crucial for efficient state updates.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly efficient in terms of hardware utilization, memory management, and gradient computation, thereby improving overall performance and scalability.\n",

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states test-time adaptation integration optimization*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals and requirements for improving the autoregressive language model design, here are some relevant insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Integration Techniques for Combining Matrix-Valued States with Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- The concept of test-time adaptation (TTA) can be integrated with matrix-valued states by leveraging self-supervised learning techniques. For instance, the TALoS method described in uses self-supervision to adapt the model to the test environment. This approach could be adapted to language models by incorporating self-supervised tasks that update the model's parameters based on the test data, potentially using matrix-valued states to represent complex contextual information.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Mechanisms for Updating Matrix-Valued States\n\n- The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method mentioned in is particularly relevant. LoRA involves updating the model parameters using the product of two low-rank matrices, which can be highly memory-efficient. This technique can be applied to update matrix-valued states in language models, reducing the memory footprint while maintaining the model's performance.\n- Additionally, the MICROADAM optimizer proposed in minimizes memory overhead by compressing gradient information, which could be beneficial for updating matrix-valued states efficiently.\n\n### Performance Optimization Strategies for Hybrid Architectures Combining Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The insights from \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers,\" \"Lightning Attention,\" and \"FlashAttention-2\" highlight the importance of efficient attention mechanisms. For hybrid architectures, splitting attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks, as in \"Lightning Attention,\" can be effective. This approach allows for the use of conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention for inter-blocks, optimizing both performance and memory usage.\n- Work partitioning and parallel computation strategies, as discussed in \"FlashAttention-2,\" can also be applied to hybrid architectures to optimize performance and reduce communication overhead.\n\n### Practical Implementations of Test-Time Adaptation in Efficient Language Models\n\n- The TALoS framework in provides a practical implementation of test-time adaptation, which can be adapted to language models. This involves using dual optimization schemes and self-supervision to adapt the model to the test environment without requiring additional training data.\n- For language models, test-time adaptation could involve updating the model's parameters based on the test data using techniques like pseudo-labeling or information maximization, similar to the approaches discussed in.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Ensuring that the integration of matrix-valued states and test-time adaptation is I/O-aware and optimizes work partitioning across GPU resources is crucial. This involves strategies like those mentioned in the \"FlashAttention-2\" and \"Lightning Attention\" papers.\n- **Memory Hierarchy**: Efficient state management techniques and consideration of the memory hierarchy are essential for optimizing the performance of hybrid architectures. This includes using block-based computation strategies and minimizing memory movement.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that integrates matrix-valued states with test-time adaptation, optimizes memory usage, and enhances performance through efficient attention mechanisms and hardware-aware implementations.\n",

Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer.

[2017], with dot-product attention as the fundamental component, have emerged as dominant architectures in various artificial intelligence tasks, especially in language modeling Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2019]. By enabling direct interaction between every pair of elements in a sequence, Transformers overcome the limitations of long-range dependencies and enable parallelization, which make them validly scale up to efficiently learn and exhibit emergent abilities Kaplan et al. [2020]. However, Transformers face the challenge of high computational costs in dot-product attention operations, which scale quadratically with the length of the sequence. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [1997], Chung et al. [2014] naturally offer low computational costs with linearly scaling in space and time requirements. The reason is that RNNs generate the currently hidden states $h_{t}$ giving the current input and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at position $t$. Unfortunately, this sequential nature leads to RNNs being unable to parallel and bear the gradient vanishing problem, with the result that they lack scalability Hochreiter [1998], Le and Zuidema [2016]. To achieve parallelization and low computational costs, the architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023], redesigns the tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021] as a linear attention mechanism with a time-sequential mode similar to RNNs. Regretfully, the RWKV cannot afford to capture long-range dependencies over long sequences since the information would be lost in the sequential flow, in contrast to standard attentions Bahdanau et al. [2016]. In this paper, we propose the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture based on RWKV for discharging long-range interactions and performing efficient information flow in which mediums are incorporated. Especially, the RRWKV model is to obtain the appropriate messages specifically addressing the issues of information redundancy that may occur with the attention mechanisms and information loss with the RWKV. ## 2 Background\n\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce the development history of RWKV from the standard transformer architectures and then analyse the reasons of lacking long-range dependencies in RWKV. On the one hand, we discuss dot-product\n\n[^0]attention and tensor-product attention in standard transformer architectures. On the other hand, we uncover the underlying ideas of two blocks in RWKV and the deficiencies they bring. ### 2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture\n\nHere we simply review the core components of Transformers, attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms leverage query, key, and value components to facilitate information selection. The query encapsulates the context of a specific matter, while the keys and values correspond to the input elements. By evaluating compatibility between the query and each key, attention weights are assigned to the corresponding values. These weighted values are then summed, enabling the matter to incorporate pertinent information from values. ### 2.1.1 Dot-Product Attention\n\nIn dot-product attention Vaswani et al. [2017], attention weights are determined by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors. The dot-product serves as a measure of similarity and represents the compatibility between the query and key. Mathematically, for a given sequence of tokens, the dot-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right) \\cdot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ represents the query vector, $k$ represents the key vector, $v$ represents the value vector, and scaling factor is neglected for convenience. Dot-product attention effectively implements the core idea of attention mechanisms and allows for parallel computation at each time step. However, it is constrained by the quadratic calculation and storage requirements of the similarity matrix, limiting its capabilities. ### 2.1.2 Tensor-Product Attention\n\nIn tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021], the determination of attention weights is based on the key vectors and position biases, replacing the conventional use of key and query vectors Bahdanau et al. [2016], Vaswani et al. [2017]. The tensor-product performs the role of feature interaction between the query and the weighted sum value. Correspondingly, the tensor-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right) \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere each $w_{t, i}$ is a learned scalar which introduces an offset in the key vector $i$. This implies that key vectors can be adjusted to be more suitable for the specific query at time $t$. Although the tensor-product attention still retains the same high computational costs as the dot-product attention, it can be transformed into a linear complexity operation by disregarding the position biases. ### 2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Architecture\n\nHere we briefly analyse the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture which combines the sequential mode of RNNs and then achieves the linear calculation and storage costs.\n```\n\n#### 3. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/97 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2305.13048, 2023.

We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Optimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (\"x-formers\") have been introduced to reduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other efficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021). Some recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al., 2019) share similarities with RWKV's chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient, their time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV achieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN. Attention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to scale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing attention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a computationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point where drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense. There has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and its successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work, Poli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the performance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021). Advances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto et al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al., 2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels. While QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as an attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN, RWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable. ## D Time-Mixing Block as an RNN Cell\n\nAs stated in 3.3, the RWKV time-mixing block can be formulated as an RNN, as the $W K V$ computation can be written in such a recursive form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0} & =0 \\\\\nw k v_{t} & =\\frac{a_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}} \\odot v_{t}}{b_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}}} \\\\\na_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot a_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}} \\odot v_{t} \\\\\nb_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot b_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe dataflow of the RNN-like time-mixing is shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 5.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/27 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nIn 18th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 24), 2024.

An attention free transformer. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.14103, 2021. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A Quantization for MatMul-free Dense Layers\n\nDuring training, we first quantized the weights to $\\{-1,0,1\\}$ by using an absmean quantization function, which scales the weight matrix by its average absolute value and rounds each element to the nearest ternary integer among $\\{-1,0,+1\\}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{W}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}=\\operatorname{RoundClip}\\left(\\frac{W}{\\gamma+\\epsilon},-1,1\\right) \\\\\n\\operatorname{RoundClip}(x, a, b)=\\max (a, \\min (b, \\operatorname{round}(x))) \\\\\n\\gamma=\\frac{1}{n m} \\sum_{i j}\\left|W_{i j}\\right|\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ and $m$ are the number of rows and columns of $W$. After weight quantization, activations are also quantized to 8 -bit precision, as is done with BitNet. We use absmax quantization, which scales activations into the range $\\left[-Q_{b}, Q_{b}\\right]$, given that $b$ is the number of bits and $Q_{b}=2^{b-1}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\widetilde{x}=\\operatorname{Quant}(x)=\\operatorname{Clip}\\left(x \\times \\frac{Q_{b}}{\\gamma},-Q_{b}+\\epsilon, Q_{b}-\\epsilon\\right) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Clip}(x, a, b)=\\max (a, \\min (b, x)), \\quad \\gamma=\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a small number that prevents overflow during clipping. With these quantization equations, the MatMul can be written as:\n\n$$\ny=\\widetilde{x} \\circledast \\widetilde{\\mathbf{W}}\n$$\n\nTo preserve variance and maintain numerical stability after quantization, we use RMSNorm [61] before activation quantization, which is also used in BitNet:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ny=\\widetilde{x} \\circledast \\widetilde{\\mathbf{W}}=\\operatorname{Quant}(\\operatorname{RMSNorm}(x)) \\circledast \\widetilde{\\mathbf{W}} \\times \\frac{\\beta \\gamma}{Q_{b}} \\\\\n\\operatorname{RMSNorm}(x)=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{E}\\left(x^{2}\\right)+\\epsilon}}, \\quad \\beta=\\frac{1}{n m}\\|W\\|_{1}, \\quad \\gamma=\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{b}$ is the max value for activation, and $\\beta$ is the mean of the weight matrix. ## B RWKV-4 as a MatMul-free Token Mixer\n\nRWKV-4 can also function as a token mixer which utilizes recurrence to mix temporal information and a 1-D hidden states that is updated using element-wise Hadamard products which avoids MatMul operations. This approach offers several advantages over conventional transformers, including computational efficiency, effective propagation of information across time steps, simplified model architecture, and reduced memory usage. Given the good performance of RWKV-4 in capturing dependencies and relationships between tokens across long-ranges of time steps, we additionally tested a ternary version of RWKV-4, though it underperformed compared to what we proposed in the\nmain manuscript. In the interest of saving the research community compute-hours, we explain the process and report our 'negative' results here. The RWKV-4 token mixer can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{r}_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{r} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{r}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\\right) \\circledast \\mathbf{W}_{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{k}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\\right) \\circledast \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{v} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{v}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\\right) \\circledast \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t} & =\\frac{\\mathbf{a}_{t-1}+e^{\\mathbf{m}+\\mathbf{k}_{t}} \\odot \\mathbf{v}_{t}}{\\mathbf{b}_{t-1}+e^{\\mathbf{m}+\\mathbf{k}_{t}}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_{t} & =e^{-\\mathbf{w}} \\odot \\mathbf{a}_{t-1}+e^{\\mathbf{k}_{t}} \\odot \\mathbf{v}_{t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{b}_{t} & =e^{-\\mathbf{w}} \\odot \\mathbf{b}_{t-1}+e^{\\mathbf{k}_{t}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{t} & =\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{r}_{t}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t}\\right) \\circledast \\mathbf{W}_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_{0} & =0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{b}_{0} & =0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{W}_{r}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{W}_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are the ternary weights for the block, $a_{t}, b_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}$ are the hidden states at timestep $t, \\circledast$ represents the ternary accumulation operation, and odot represents the element-wise product. The variables $r_{t}, k_{t}, v_{t}$ are the receptance, key, and value at timestep $t$, respectively. The decay factors $e^{m}, e^{-w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}$ are used to decay the hidden state and input, while $\\mu_{r}, \\mu_{k}, \\mu_{v}$ are time mixing factors that allow 2-gram information flow between tokens, which is also used in RWKV-4. $\\sigma$ denotes the sigmoid function, used for gating. RWKV-4 retains the softmax-like structure in calculating hidden state $h_{t}$, which is adopted from the Attention Free Transformer [62]. This approach has been shown to significantly improve model performance compared to other activation functions. However, the use of softmax introduces two challenges that may hinder the hardware implementation of MatMul-free models. First, the exponential operation, applied to $e^{m}+k$ in RWKV-4, is a transcendental funcntion and often requires approximations in resource-constrained hardware to compute arbitrarily, or look-up tables which increases memory usage. Second, the division between two dynamic vectors further increases computation cost. Additionally, the division operation expands the hidden state, resulting in a $2 \\times d$ hidden state $\\left(a_{t}\\right.$ and $\\left.b_{t}\\right)$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 1 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: RWKV matrix-valued states dynamic recurrence\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Our architectural design advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models, ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6 and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive performance across a wide variety of benchmarks.

This approach involves storing and updating state information in a matrix form, which allows for more flexible and efficient handling of sequential data. The matrix-valued states are updated through dynamic recurrence, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Matrix-Valued States vs Traditional State Representations\n\n- The use of matrix-valued states in RWKV architectures has been shown to improve performance compared to traditional state representations. For instance, the matrix-valued states allow for better memorization of long-range history, which is crucial for tasks requiring long-term planning and understanding. This is achieved by making the transformation matrix a diagonal matrix, which significantly enhances the capability to model long-range history.\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Computational Complexity of Matrix-Valued State Operations\n\n- Matrix-valued states in RWKV architectures offer improved memory efficiency compared to traditional transformer models. Since RWKV models only store and attend to their recurrent state, they avoid the need for additional memory or time when generating large sequences. This is in contrast to transformers, which require memory and generation time that scale linearly with context length.\n\n- The computational complexity of matrix-valued state operations is generally lower than that of transformers. RWKV models, such as those using state space models (SSMs), have O(N) time complexity and O(1) memory complexity with respect to sequence length, whereas transformers have O(N^2) time and memory complexity.\n\n## Integration of Matrix-Valued States with Other Architectural Components\n\n- The integration of matrix-valued states with other components, such as linear attention mechanisms, is crucial for the overall performance of the model. For example, the use of RMSNorm layers after certain blocks in the RWKV architecture helps stabilize the training process and improve model stability, similar to practices in transformer models.\n\n- The dynamic recurrence mechanism in RWKV allows for effective test-time adaptation. This involves updating the matrix-valued states based on the input during test time, which can be done efficiently without significant computational overhead. This approach is novel compared to other designs like FastTTTLinear, which focuses on different adaptation mechanisms.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **State Management and Memory Efficiency**: The use of matrix-valued states requires careful state management to optimize memory usage while maintaining expressiveness. Techniques such as dynamic resampling of input frames based on events rather than fixed time steps can help in achieving this goal.\n\n- **Linear Attention Implementation**: The latest advances in hardware-efficient linear attention can be integrated with RWKV's matrix-valued states. This involves optimizing the attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance, which is a key trade-off in designing efficient autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researchers can leverage the benefits of matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence in RWKV architectures to improve the overall performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/39 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nPsychological review, 63:91-97, 1956.

Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training adaptation language models state updates*\n\n*Shuai Zhao, Xiaohan Wang, Linchao Zhu, Yezhou Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident, and builds different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation~(TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed \\textit{reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback~(RLCF)} framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training adaptation language models state updates*\n\n*Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani, Jiayu Liu, Reinhard Heckel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference that essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. SwapPrompt: Test-Time Prompt Adaptation for Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training adaptation language models state updates*\n\n*Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo, Wenchao Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SwapPrompt is a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation and achieves state-of-the-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt, a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation. SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism, which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically, we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement, and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets. It is also shown that SwapPrompt can even achieve comparable performance with supervised prompt adaptation methods\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training adaptation language models state updates*\n\n*Manli Shu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Zhiding Yu, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Chaowei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) is proposed, a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample and performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

Ziegler, Christopher Berner, Benjamin Mann, Aditya Ramesh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning Neural Models for Natural Language Processing in the Face of Distributional Shift\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training adaptation language models state updates*\n\n*Paul Michel*\n\n**Abstract:** The dominating NLP paradigm of training a strong neural predictor to perform one task on a specific dataset has led to state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications (eg. sentiment classification, span-prediction based question answering or machine translation). However, it builds upon the assumption that the data distribution is stationary, ie. that the data is sampled from a fixed distribution both at training and test time. This way of training is inconsistent with how we as humans are able to learn from and operate within a constantly changing stream of information. Moreover, it is ill-adapted to real-world use cases where the data distribution is expected to shift over the course of a model's lifetime. The first goal of this thesis is to characterize the different forms this shift can take in the context of natural language processing, and propose benchmarks and evaluation metrics to measure its effect on current deep learning architectures. We then proceed to take steps to mitigate the effect of distributional shift on NLP models. To this end, we develop methods based on parametric reformulations of the distributionally robust optimization framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that these approaches yield more robust models as demonstrated on a selection of realistic problems. In the third and final part of this thesis, we explore ways of efficiently adapting existing models to new domains or tasks. Our contribution to this topic takes inspiration from information geometry to derive a new gradient update rule which alleviate catastrophic forgetting issues during adaptation.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on test-time training mechanisms, state adaptation techniques, and their integration with different state representations, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Test-Time Training Mechanisms in Language Models\n\n- **Test-time fine-tuning** has been shown to significantly improve language modeling abilities. This approach involves fine-tuning the parameters of a pre-trained model at test-time specifically for each prompt. It is particularly effective when the prompt is not well-represented in the pre-training data, such as in cases of distribution shift.\n- The paper \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" discusses a method called ADAPTIVE SIFT, which adaptively stops fine-tuning based on performance gains and uncertainty estimates, making it computationally scalable and efficient.\n\n## State Adaptation Techniques During Inference\n\n- **Local fine-tuning** and **test-time fine-tuning** are state adaptation techniques that adjust the model's parameters based on the test instance itself. These methods have been found to be robust and effective, especially in scenarios where the test data differs significantly from the training data.\n- In the context of medical vision-language models, a simple linear-probe adaptation method that updates visual prototypes and text embeddings via learnable class-wise multipliers has shown competitive performance while being computationally efficient.\n\n## Integration of Test-Time Updates with Different State Representations\n\n- For models like RWKV, which use matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence mechanisms, integrating test-time fine-tuning could involve adapting these states based on the test instance. The idea is to leverage the expressivity of matrix-valued states while maintaining the efficiency characteristics of RNNs.\n- The paper on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time\" suggests that test-time fine-tuning can be meta-learned to adapt to different prompts efficiently, which could be integrated with the dynamic recurrence mechanism of RWKV to enhance its adaptability.\n\n## Memory and Computational Requirements for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Test-time fine-tuning methods like ADAPTIVE SIFT are designed to spend test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains, making them more efficient compared to fixed compute approaches.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Techniques such as activation checkpointing, zero-offload, and low-rank adaptation (e.g., LoRA fine-tuning) can significantly reduce memory usage and computational time during fine-tuning, which is crucial for integrating test-time adaptation with models like RWKV.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Test-Time Fine-Tuning**: This approach can significantly improve language modeling performance, especially in scenarios with distribution shifts. It can be integrated with models like RWKV by adapting the matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence mechanisms.\n- **Efficient Adaptation**: Methods like ADAPTIVE SIFT and linear-probe adaptation ensure that test-time adaptation is computationally and memory-efficient, which is essential for practical applications.\n- **State Representation**: Adapting matrix-valued states and using dynamic recurrence mechanisms can enhance the expressivity and adaptability of the model during test-time, aligning with the design principles of RWKV.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, the researchers can develop more efficient and adaptive autoregressive language models that leverage test-time training mechanisms while maintaining the efficiency and expressivity of models like RWKV.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance.

As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Score: 0.07)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations linear attention memory optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations linear attention memory optimization*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling for Memory Efficient Adaptation of Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations linear attention memory optimization*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Guanchu Wang, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, D. Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations linear attention memory optimization*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, and parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 666  (*Influential: 69*)\n\n#### 5. XCiT: Cross-Covariance Image Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations linear attention memory optimization*\n\n*Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Hugo Touvron, Mathilde Caron, Piotr Bojanowski, Matthijs Douze, Armand Joulin, I. Laptev, N. Neverova, Gabriel Synnaeve, Jakob Verbeek, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a \"transposed\"version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and queries, and builds upon XCA, which has linear complexity in the number of tokens and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images.\n\n**Abstract:** Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have recently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e. words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the local interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long sequences and high-resolution images. We propose a\"transposed\"version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and queries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It combines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of convolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of XCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including image classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k, object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20k.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 433  (*Influential: 53*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware-efficient implementations, memory optimization, efficient linear attention mechanisms, and test-time adaptation, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Matrix Operations\n\n### Linear-Complexity Multiplication (-Mul)\nThe paper \"Addition is All You Need for Energy-Efficient Language Models\" introduces the -Mul algorithm, which approximates floating-point multiplications using integer additions. This method significantly reduces computational resources and energy consumption, particularly in the attention mechanism of transformer models, without compromising performance.\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe work on memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer networks demonstrates a hardware accelerator that performs matrix multiplications using memristor crossbar arrays. This approach achieves a 10\u00d7 acceleration in transformer self-attention computations compared to digital implementations, with significantly reduced power consumption.\n\n### Optimizations Using IREE Compiler\nThe SiFive RISC-V Intelligence platform optimization uses the IREE compiler to optimize matrix multiplication operations. Techniques such as kernel fusion, tiling, and loop unrolling, along with careful register and cache tiling, maximize computational throughput and minimize memory access, leading to substantial performance improvements.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Large State Matrices\n\n### Cache Tiling and Register Optimization\nThe IREE compiler optimizations include cache tiling and register tiling strategies that improve data locality and reduce memory latency. By adjusting the register tile size and cache tiling size dynamically, these optimizations ensure that data remains in the cache hierarchy for as long as possible, reducing memory access overhead.\n\n### Efficient Memory Access in FlashAttention\nFlashAttention proposes tiling the matrices \\(Q\\), \\(K\\), and \\(V\\) to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU global memory and on-chip SRAM. This approach avoids significant global memory IO, enhancing performance by minimizing cache misses.\n\n## Efficient Linear Attention Mechanisms with State Management\n\n### SageAttention\nSageAttention introduces an efficient INT8 quantization method for attention mechanisms, which is more precise and faster than FP8 quantization on certain GPUs. It uses a low-precision FP16 accumulator for matrix multiplications, enhancing both speed and accuracy. This method also includes adaptive quantization and smoothing techniques to maintain high accuracy with minimal overhead.\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nTechniques like Linformer, Performer, MetaFormer, and LinearAttention reduce the time complexity of attention mechanisms from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\). These methods are particularly useful for scenarios where standard attention is computationally prohibitive.\n\n## Implementation Strategies for Test-Time Adaptation with Minimal Memory Overhead\n\n### Test-Time Training Layers\nThe concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, where the hidden state is updated through self-supervised learning during inference, can be adapted to matrix-valued states. This approach requires careful balancing of expressiveness and efficiency to avoid increased memory requirements[Analysis Note].\n\n### Dual-State Approaches\nMethods like SwapPrompt, which employ dual prompts to retain historical information, could inspire similar dual-state approaches for matrix-state updates. These methods need to be optimized to ensure minimal memory overhead while maintaining adaptability during test-time[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language models, researchers can leverage:\n\n- **Hardware-efficient matrix operations**: Use -Mul for energy-efficient multiplications, memristor-based acceleration, and IREE compiler optimizations.\n- **Memory optimization**: Implement cache tiling, register optimization, and efficient memory access strategies like those in FlashAttention.\n- **Efficient linear attention**: Utilize INT8 quantization with SageAttention, and consider linear attention mechanisms like Linformer and Performer.\n- **Test-time adaptation**: Integrate TTT layers and dual-state approaches while optimizing for minimal memory overhead.\n",
