The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Hanna M.

URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1472. ## A PreLIMINARY\n\n## A. 1 RoPE FROM SEQUENCE DOMAIN\n\nTransformer models require the integration of explicit positional information through positional embeddings to effectively discern the order of input sequences (Vaswani et al. 2017). In this work, we direct our attention to the specific instance of positional encoding known as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), as prominently featured in the architecture of the LLaMA model (Touvron et al. 2023a b). Given a query vector $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}=\\left[q_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, q_{t}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $t$ and a key vector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{s}=\\left[k_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, k_{s}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $s$, RoPE first splits $q_{t}, k_{s}$ into pairs on the direction of feature dimensions, with every two dimensions forming a complex number, or a vector in the complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}=\\left[\\tilde{q}_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)}=q_{t}^{(2 n)}+i q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}=\\left[\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)}=k_{s}^{(2 n)}+i k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAfter that, RoPE injects the position information by an element-wise multiplication between the preprocessed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}$ and a list of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$-parameterized rotary vectors in the complex plane. When attention\nis calculated, relative position information $t-s$ is acquired through $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t} \\odot e^{i t \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s} \\odot e^{i s \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} e^{i t \\theta_{n}}\\left(\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)} e^{i s \\theta_{n}}\\right)^{*}\\right]=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left(q_{t}^{(2 n)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}+q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\\right) \\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}+ \\\\\n&\\left.k_{s}^{(2 n)} k^{(2 n+1)}-q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}\\right) \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile RoPE can theoretically convey the relative information at any context length, RoPE still fails to extrapolate practically. It is worth noting that rotary angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in Equation 8 play an important role. In the vanilla design of RoPE, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is defined as Equation 9 . Different angles correspond to different features and that is the starting point of most RoPE-based extrapolation methods (bloc97, 2023b, Rozi\u00e8re et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. cosFormer: Rethinking Softmax in Attention (Avg.

As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

Also, since they only change the position embedding on the numerator while keeping the denominator unchanged, the summation of their attention scores is not equal to 1. For Stochastic Positional Encoding (Liutkus et al., 2021), they use a sampling strategy to approximate the softmax, and introduce relative positional encoding to linear transformers.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.

We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation. - We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention. - We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives.

We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2).

The corresponding word embedding of $\\mathbb{S}_{N}$ is denoted as $\\mathbb{E}_{N}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token $w_{i}$ without position information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms them into queries, keys, and value representations. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =f_{q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =f_{k}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{n} & =f_{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}_{n}$ incorporate the $m^{t h}$ and $n^{t h}$ positions through $f_{q}, f_{k}$ and $f_{v}$, respectively. The query and key values are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\nrepresentation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{m, n} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m} & =\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{m, n} \\boldsymbol{v}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form Equation 11 . ### 2.2 Absolute position embedding\n\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\n\n$$\nf_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, i\\right):=\\boldsymbol{W}_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}+\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{p}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIt enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence.

Keywords Pre-trained Language Models $\\cdot$ Position Information Encoding $\\cdot$ Pre-training $\\cdot$ Natural Language Processing. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe sequential order of words is of great value to natural language understanding. Recurrent neural networks (RRNs) based models encode tokens' order by recursively computing a hidden state along the time dimension. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) based models (CNNs) Gehring et al. 2017] were typically considered position-agnostic, but recent work Islam et al. [2020] has shown that the commonly used padding operation can implicitly learn position information. Recently, the pre-trained language models (PLMs), which were built upon the transformer Vaswani et al. [2017], have achieved the state-of-the-art performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including context representation learning Devlin et al. [2019], machine translation Vaswani et al. [2017], and language modeling Radford et al. [2019], to name a few. Unlike, RRNs and CNNs-based models, PLMs utilize the self-attention mechanism to semantically capture the contextual representation of a given corpus. As a consequence, PLMs achieve a significant improvement in terms of parallelization over RNNs and improve the modeling ability of longer intra-token relations compared to CNNSt\n\n[^0]It is noteworthy that the self-attention architecture of the current PLMs has shown to be position-agnostic Yun et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\", \"Linear Attention\", \"Efficient Transformers\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Inkit Padhi, K. Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 114  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2. KERPLE: Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding for Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Ta-Chung Chi, Ting-Han Fan, P. Ramadge, Alexander I. Rudnicky*\n\n**TL;DR:** KERPLE is proposed, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, and it is shown that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset.\n\n**Abstract:** Relative positional embeddings (RPE) have received considerable attention since RPEs effectively model the relative distance among tokens and enable length extrapolation. We propose KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences. We achieve this goal using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, a class of functions known for generalizing distance metrics. To maintain the inner product interpretation of self-attention, we show that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length extrapolation in a principled way. Experiments demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets. Our implementation and pretrained checkpoints are released at~\\url{https://github.com/chijames/KERPLE.git}.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. Recurrent Positional Embedding for Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Kehai Chen, Rui Wang, M. Utiyama, E. Sumita*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed recurrent positional embedding approach based on word vector improved translation performance over that of the state-of-the-art Transformer baseline in WMT\u201914 English-to-German and NIST Chinese- to-English translation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In the Transformer network architecture, positional embeddings are used to encode order dependencies into the input representation. However, this input representation only involves static order dependencies based on discrete numerical information, that is, are independent of word content. To address this issue, this work proposes a recurrent positional embedding approach based on word vector. In this approach, these recurrent positional embeddings are learned by a recurrent neural network, encoding word content-based order dependencies into the input representation. They are then integrated into the existing multi-head self-attention model as independent heads or part of each head. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach improved translation performance over that of the state-of-the-art Transformer baseline in WMT\u201914 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1337  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6.

Jadbabaie, S. Sra*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer training is notoriously difficult, requiring a careful design of optimizers and use of various heuristics. We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformers\"*\n\n*Hugo Touvron, M. Cord, Matthijs Douze, Francisco Massa, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Herv'e J'egou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work produces a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only and introduces a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers that relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 5590  (*Influential: 910*)\n\n#### 8. Long Range Arena: A Benchmark for Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformers\"*\n\n*Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Samira Abnar, Yikang Shen, Dara Bahri, Philip Pham, J. Rao, Liu Yang, Sebastian Ruder, Donald Metzler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios is proposed, paving the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Dawei Zhu, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and\nRAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens,\nembedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k\ntokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as\nlegal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing\nembedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional\ntraining. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for\nlong context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed\ncomprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks,\nfeaturing documents of varying length and dispersed target information.\nBenchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models.\nBased on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window\nextension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the\ncontext window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of\ntheir original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models\nemploying absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further\nfine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving\noriginal behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding\n(RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific\nmethods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for\ncontext window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k\nand E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-18T11:29:23Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-25T02:26:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformers\"*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, Henryk Michalewski*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling\ntasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to\nproduce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or\nwell-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are\nimpressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their\napplications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit\nhierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle\nlong sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to\ndownsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them\nhierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to\ncreate Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass\nimproves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and\ncan yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently.

Linearizing Transformer with Key-Value Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformers\"*\n\n*Yizhe Zhang, Deng Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient transformer variants with linear time complexity have been\ndeveloped to mitigate the quadratic computational overhead of the vanilla\ntransformer. Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and\nkernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer\nfrom a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence\ngeneration tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation\nis short. We propose MemSizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap\nwhile improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the\nsource sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while\nenjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to\nkernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant\nmemory complexity at inference time. MemSizer also employs a lightweight\nmulti-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head\nmodel. We demonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved balance between\nefficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient\ntransformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including\nmachine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-23T18:10:18Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T03:05:05Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Ahmed Murtadha, Yunfeng Liu, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Yu Lu, Jianlin Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results.

Rotary Position Embedding for Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\"*\n\n*Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han, Song Park, Byeongho Heo*\n\n**Abstract:** Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) performs remarkably on language models, especially for length extrapolation of Transformers. However, the impacts of RoPE on computer vision domains have been underexplored, even though RoPE appears capable of enhancing Vision Transformer (ViT) performance in a way similar to the language domain. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of RoPE when applied to ViTs, utilizing practical implementations of RoPE for 2D vision data. The analysis reveals that RoPE demonstrates impressive extrapolation performance, i.e., maintaining precision while increasing image resolution at inference. It eventually leads to performance improvement for ImageNet-1k, COCO detection, and ADE-20k segmentation. We believe this study provides thorough guidelines to apply RoPE into ViT, promising improved backbone performance with minimal extra computational overhead.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformers\"*\n\n*Ping Luo, Jose M. Alvarez, Anima Anandkumar, Zhiding Yu, Wenhai Wang, Enze Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Hanna M.

URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1472. ## A PreLIMINARY\n\n## A. 1 RoPE FROM SEQUENCE DOMAIN\n\nTransformer models require the integration of explicit positional information through positional embeddings to effectively discern the order of input sequences (Vaswani et al. 2017). In this work, we direct our attention to the specific instance of positional encoding known as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), as prominently featured in the architecture of the LLaMA model (Touvron et al. 2023a b). Given a query vector $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}=\\left[q_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, q_{t}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $t$ and a key vector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{s}=\\left[k_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, k_{s}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $s$, RoPE first splits $q_{t}, k_{s}$ into pairs on the direction of feature dimensions, with every two dimensions forming a complex number, or a vector in the complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}=\\left[\\tilde{q}_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)}=q_{t}^{(2 n)}+i q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}=\\left[\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)}=k_{s}^{(2 n)}+i k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAfter that, RoPE injects the position information by an element-wise multiplication between the preprocessed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}$ and a list of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$-parameterized rotary vectors in the complex plane. When attention\nis calculated, relative position information $t-s$ is acquired through $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t} \\odot e^{i t \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s} \\odot e^{i s \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} e^{i t \\theta_{n}}\\left(\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)} e^{i s \\theta_{n}}\\right)^{*}\\right]=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left(q_{t}^{(2 n)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}+q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\\right) \\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}+ \\\\\n&\\left.k_{s}^{(2 n)} k^{(2 n+1)}-q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}\\right) \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile RoPE can theoretically convey the relative information at any context length, RoPE still fails to extrapolate practically. It is worth noting that rotary angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in Equation 8 play an important role. In the vanilla design of RoPE, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is defined as Equation 9 . Different angles correspond to different features and that is the starting point of most RoPE-based extrapolation methods (bloc97, 2023b, Rozi\u00e8re et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Suyuchen Wang, I. Kobyzev, Peng Lu, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Resonance RoPE is introduced, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenarios in Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where models pre-trained on shorter sequences face difficulty with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences. We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/23 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2024); Rozi\u00e8re et al. (2023); Xiong et al. (2023) modify RoPE's rotary base and employ fine-tuning on extended sequences, termed Adjusted Base Frequency (ABF) or \"NTKaware\" scaling. Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) achieved 16 K context length with this method after 10,000 fine-tuning steps. YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) improved NTK-aware scaling by segmenting RoPE features and applying tailored extrapolation strategies, achieving 64 K context length for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 400 finetuning steps. Distinguishingly, our RESONANCE RoPE focus on reducing feature interpolation on OOD positions, which we argue is another important factor in improving the length extrapolation capability of Transformer. ### 2.2 Long Context Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of Transformer-based LLMs' longcontext capabilities are twofold: synthetic task assessments for length extrapolation strategies and real-world task evaluations at the LLM scale. Synthetic evaluations target simple tasks such as long sequence classification (Tay et al., 2021) and arithmetic language modeling (Liu et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). LLM scale evaluations measure metrics such as perplexity (PPL) in extensive\ntext corpora (e.g., PG19 (Rae et al., 2020), GovReport (Huang et al., 2021), GitHub (Wu et al., 2022)) and complex tasks including summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning (An et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2023). ## 3 Background\n\n### 3.1 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)\n\nIn Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), the selfattention scores are softmax-normalized scaled attention logits $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ :\n\n$$\na_{m, n}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSuppose the input to a single attention head is $\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the dimension of an attention head. RoPE injects the position information of each token into the $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$ vectors by the following equations in the complex space:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\theta_{j} & =b^{\\frac{-2 j}{d}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k}$ are trainable parameters, and $b$ is a constant called the rotary base, which is set to 10,000 (Su et al., 2024) or other integers or fractions (Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). This form makes the dot product between the $m$-th query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}$ and $n$-th key $\\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ only depend on the input $\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ and their relative distance $(m-n)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}^{*} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\\right) e^{i(m-n) \\theta_{j}}\\right] \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRoPE's real-number implementation divides the $d$ dimension space into multiple 2-dimensional subspaces and applies real rotation matrix to each of them. Formally, define a $d \\times d$ block-diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{0}, m} & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{1}, m} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}, m}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{0}, \\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}\\right\\}$, and each $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ rotation matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos m \\theta_{j} & -\\sin m \\theta_{j} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{j} & \\cos m \\theta_{j}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nRoPE computes the attention logit $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n-m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor each two dimensions $[2 j: 2 j+1]$ of $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$, its corresponding $\\theta_{j}$ reflects a temporal wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$. This wavelength describes the token length for the corresponding RoPE features to encounter approximately the same rotary angle $m \\theta_{j}$ in Equation 3:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{j}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 j}{d}}\n$$\n\nAs an example, the wavelengths of LLaMA / LLaMA2's RoPE features range from $2 \\pi \\approx 6.28$ for $\\theta_{0}$ to $2 * 10000^{126 / 128} \\pi \\approx 54410.14$ for $\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}$. ### 3.2 Critical Dimensions of RoPE\n\nIn a TSTL scenario (Press et al., 2022), one takes a model trained on texts with lengths up to $L$, and tests it on a task with input lengths up to $L^{\\prime}=s L$, with the scaling factor $s>1$. Recently, Liu et al. (2024) discovered that there may exist two \"critical dimensions\" in RoPE features, which correspond to the dimensions $[2 c: 2 c+1]$ that satisfies $\\lambda_{c} \\geq L$ and $\\lambda_{c-1}<L$. The dimensions of RoPE features above and below the critical dimension (which we denote as \"post-critical dimensions\" and \"pre-critical dimensions\", respectively) have different behaviors in TSTL: for post-critical dimensions (i.e., $j>c$ ), since their wavelengths satisfy $\\lambda_{j}>L$, the training corpus does not cover all possible rotary angles $m \\theta_{j}$ on a unit circle. Thus, these dimensions will encounter OOD value range on longer sequences. This is not an issue for precritical dimensions due to their shorter temporal wavelengths. The concept of RoPE's critical dimensions implicitly guides the development of RoPE scaling methods. For example, previous RoPE scaling methods (Chen et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024) mainly focus on reducing or avoiding value extrapolation on post-critical dimensions, and minimize post-training modifications to the pre-critical dimensions. ### 3.3 Yet another RoPE extensioN (YaRN)\n\nYaRN (Peng et al., 2024) is the current state-of-theart RoPE scaling method for TSTL. It introduces the \"NTK-by-parts\" scaling for RoPE, which applies different scaling strategies to each RoPE feature according to its temporal wavelength.

[2020] focuses on relative position encoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these approaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the perspective of Neural ODE [hen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the position information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better performance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE. In brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\n- We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly built based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation. - We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention. - We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained language models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer\n\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2).

Finally, we conclude this paper in Section (5)\n\n## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Preliminary\n\nLet $\\mathbb{S}_{N}=\\left\\{w_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be a sequence of $N$ input tokens with $w_{i}$ being the $i^{t h}$ element. The corresponding word embedding of $\\mathbb{S}_{N}$ is denoted as $\\mathbb{E}_{N}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token $w_{i}$ without position information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms them into queries, keys, and value representations. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =f_{q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =f_{k}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{n} & =f_{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}_{n}$ incorporate the $m^{t h}$ and $n^{t h}$ positions through $f_{q}, f_{k}$ and $f_{v}$, respectively. The query and key values are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\nrepresentation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{m, n} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m} & =\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{m, n} \\boldsymbol{v}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form Equation 11 . ### 2.2 Absolute position embedding\n\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\n\n$$\nf_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, i\\right):=\\boldsymbol{W}_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}+\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{p}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.\n```\n\n#### 4. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n#### 5. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated Linear Attention RoPE\", \"Rotary Positional Embeddings in Linear Attention\", \"Integrating RoPE into Gated Attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory.

Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 114  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embeddings in Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Vinit Ravishankar, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**TL;DR:** While sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models, because they were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\n\n**Abstract:** In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting, transformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for instance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several modifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used in the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance, separating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying attention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that surprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language models, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then answer why that is: sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps. Higher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher compression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned absolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal embeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding architectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn cross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrating RoPE into Gated Attention\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is focused on integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) into the Gated Linear Attention (GLA) mechanism of the FastTTTLinear model to enhance its capability to model positional information efficiently. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integration of RoPE into GLA\n\n### Feasibility and Mathematical Formulation\n- RoPE can be integrated into linear attention mechanisms by applying rotational transformations to the query and key vectors after linear projection. This is feasible as shown in the excerpts from Su et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2023), where RoPE encodes position information by rotating query and key vectors in the complex plane.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n- The rotational transformations can be applied as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\tilde{\\mathbf{q}}_t &= \\mathbf{q}_t \\circ \\mathbf{R}_t, \\\\\n  \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}_t &= \\mathbf{k}_t \\circ \\mathbf{R}_t,\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\mathbf{R}_t \\) is the rotation matrix at position \\( t \\), and \\( \\circ \\) denotes element-wise rotation.\n\n### Interaction with Gating Mechanisms\n- The researcher needs to consider how the rotational transformations interact with the gating mechanisms in GLA. This involves applying the gates before or after the rotational transformation and ensuring compatibility with the existing gating functions. The work by Yang et al. (2023) on Gated Linear Attention Transformers provides a foundation for understanding how to integrate such mechanisms efficiently.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details\n\n### Efficiency and Compatibility\n- The integration of RoPE should maintain the linear time and space complexity of FastTTTLinear. The use of rotational operations introduces minimal overhead, as discussed in Su et al. (2021) and the implementation details in the `unsloth` library, which highlights efficient kernel implementations for RoPE.\n\n### Code Implementations\n- The `unsloth` library provides optimized kernels and PyTorch autograd functions for RoPE, which can serve as a practical guide for implementation. Specifically, the `rope_embedding.py` file in the `unsloth` repository demonstrates how to implement RoPE efficiently.\n\n## Alternative Positional Encoding Methods\n\n### KERPLE and ALiBi\n- If integrating RoPE proves challenging, alternative methods like KERPLE (Kernelized Relative Positional Embedding) or ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) could be considered. KERPLE generalizes relative positional embeddings using conditionally positive definite kernels, offering flexibility in designing positional encodings compatible with linear attention.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n### Numerical Stability\n- Ensuring numerical stability is crucial, especially for very long sequences. The researcher should consider precision adjustments or normalization techniques to avoid numerical instability, as hinted in the analysis of RoPE integration.\n\n### Compatibility with Existing Units\n- It is important to ensure that integrating RoPE does not negatively affect other components of the model, such as SwiGluMLP or Conv units. Maintaining local modifications to a single GAU is key to preserving the overall model architecture.\n\n## Empirical Validation\n\n### Ablation Studies and Benchmarks\n- Conducting experiments to assess the impact of RoPE integration on model performance is essential. The researcher should look for recent experiments or benchmarks where RoPE has been integrated into linear attention models, particularly those using Gated Linear Attention. Ablation studies that isolate the effect of RoPE on performance in linear attention contexts would be particularly useful.\n\n## Key References\n\n- **Su, J., Lu, Y., Pan, S., Wen, L., & Liu, Y.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}.

URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1472. ## A PreLIMINARY\n\n## A. 1 RoPE FROM SEQUENCE DOMAIN\n\nTransformer models require the integration of explicit positional information through positional embeddings to effectively discern the order of input sequences (Vaswani et al. 2017). In this work, we direct our attention to the specific instance of positional encoding known as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), as prominently featured in the architecture of the LLaMA model (Touvron et al. 2023a b). Given a query vector $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}=\\left[q_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, q_{t}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $t$ and a key vector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{s}=\\left[k_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, k_{s}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $s$, RoPE first splits $q_{t}, k_{s}$ into pairs on the direction of feature dimensions, with every two dimensions forming a complex number, or a vector in the complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}=\\left[\\tilde{q}_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)}=q_{t}^{(2 n)}+i q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}=\\left[\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)}=k_{s}^{(2 n)}+i k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAfter that, RoPE injects the position information by an element-wise multiplication between the preprocessed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}$ and a list of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$-parameterized rotary vectors in the complex plane. When attention\nis calculated, relative position information $t-s$ is acquired through $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t} \\odot e^{i t \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s} \\odot e^{i s \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} e^{i t \\theta_{n}}\\left(\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)} e^{i s \\theta_{n}}\\right)^{*}\\right]=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left(q_{t}^{(2 n)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}+q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\\right) \\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}+ \\\\\n&\\left.k_{s}^{(2 n)} k^{(2 n+1)}-q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}\\right) \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile RoPE can theoretically convey the relative information at any context length, RoPE still fails to extrapolate practically. It is worth noting that rotary angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in Equation 8 play an important role. In the vanilla design of RoPE, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is defined as Equation 9 . Different angles correspond to different features and that is the starting point of most RoPE-based extrapolation methods (bloc97, 2023b, Rozi\u00e8re et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

[2020] focuses on relative position encoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these approaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the perspective of Neural ODE [hen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the position information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better performance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE. In brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\n- We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly built based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation. - We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention. - We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained language models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer\n\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2). We then describe the rotary position encoding (RoPE) and study its properties in Section (3) We report experiments in Section (4). Finally, we conclude this paper in Section (5)\n\n## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Preliminary\n\nLet $\\mathbb{S}_{N}=\\left\\{w_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be a sequence of $N$ input tokens with $w_{i}$ being the $i^{t h}$ element. The corresponding word embedding of $\\mathbb{S}_{N}$ is denoted as $\\mathbb{E}_{N}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token $w_{i}$ without position information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms them into queries, keys, and value representations. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =f_{q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =f_{k}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{n} & =f_{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}_{n}$ incorporate the $m^{t h}$ and $n^{t h}$ positions through $f_{q}, f_{k}$ and $f_{v}$, respectively. The query and key values are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\nrepresentation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{m, n} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m} & =\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{m, n} \\boldsymbol{v}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form Equation 11 . ### 2.2 Absolute position embedding\n\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\n\n$$\nf_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, i\\right):=\\boldsymbol{W}_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}+\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{p}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n#### 4. Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Suyuchen Wang, I.

We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/23 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2024); Rozi\u00e8re et al.

Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) achieved 16 K context length with this method after 10,000 fine-tuning steps. YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) improved NTK-aware scaling by segmenting RoPE features and applying tailored extrapolation strategies, achieving 64 K context length for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 400 finetuning steps. Distinguishingly, our RESONANCE RoPE focus on reducing feature interpolation on OOD positions, which we argue is another important factor in improving the length extrapolation capability of Transformer. ### 2.2 Long Context Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of Transformer-based LLMs' longcontext capabilities are twofold: synthetic task assessments for length extrapolation strategies and real-world task evaluations at the LLM scale. Synthetic evaluations target simple tasks such as long sequence classification (Tay et al., 2021) and arithmetic language modeling (Liu et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). LLM scale evaluations measure metrics such as perplexity (PPL) in extensive\ntext corpora (e.g., PG19 (Rae et al., 2020), GovReport (Huang et al., 2021), GitHub (Wu et al., 2022)) and complex tasks including summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning (An et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2023). ## 3 Background\n\n### 3.1 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)\n\nIn Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), the selfattention scores are softmax-normalized scaled attention logits $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ :\n\n$$\na_{m, n}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSuppose the input to a single attention head is $\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the dimension of an attention head. RoPE injects the position information of each token into the $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$ vectors by the following equations in the complex space:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\theta_{j} & =b^{\\frac{-2 j}{d}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k}$ are trainable parameters, and $b$ is a constant called the rotary base, which is set to 10,000 (Su et al., 2024) or other integers or fractions (Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). This form makes the dot product between the $m$-th query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}$ and $n$-th key $\\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ only depend on the input $\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ and their relative distance $(m-n)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}^{*} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\\right) e^{i(m-n) \\theta_{j}}\\right] \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRoPE's real-number implementation divides the $d$ dimension space into multiple 2-dimensional subspaces and applies real rotation matrix to each of them. Formally, define a $d \\times d$ block-diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{0}, m} & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{1}, m} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}, m}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{0}, \\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}\\right\\}$, and each $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ rotation matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos m \\theta_{j} & -\\sin m \\theta_{j} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{j} & \\cos m \\theta_{j}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nRoPE computes the attention logit $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n-m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor each two dimensions $[2 j: 2 j+1]$ of $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$, its corresponding $\\theta_{j}$ reflects a temporal wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$. This wavelength describes the token length for the corresponding RoPE features to encounter approximately the same rotary angle $m \\theta_{j}$ in Equation 3:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{j}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 j}{d}}\n$$\n\nAs an example, the wavelengths of LLaMA / LLaMA2's RoPE features range from $2 \\pi \\approx 6.28$ for $\\theta_{0}$ to $2 * 10000^{126 / 128} \\pi \\approx 54410.14$ for $\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}$. ### 3.2 Critical Dimensions of RoPE\n\nIn a TSTL scenario (Press et al., 2022), one takes a model trained on texts with lengths up to $L$, and tests it on a task with input lengths up to $L^{\\prime}=s L$, with the scaling factor $s>1$. Recently, Liu et al. (2024) discovered that there may exist two \"critical dimensions\" in RoPE features, which correspond to the dimensions $[2 c: 2 c+1]$ that satisfies $\\lambda_{c} \\geq L$ and $\\lambda_{c-1}<L$. The dimensions of RoPE features above and below the critical dimension (which we denote as \"post-critical dimensions\" and \"pre-critical dimensions\", respectively) have different behaviors in TSTL: for post-critical dimensions (i.e., $j>c$ ), since their wavelengths satisfy $\\lambda_{j}>L$, the training corpus does not cover all possible rotary angles $m \\theta_{j}$ on a unit circle. Thus, these dimensions will encounter OOD value range on longer sequences. This is not an issue for precritical dimensions due to their shorter temporal wavelengths. The concept of RoPE's critical dimensions implicitly guides the development of RoPE scaling methods. For example, previous RoPE scaling methods (Chen et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024) mainly focus on reducing or avoiding value extrapolation on post-critical dimensions, and minimize post-training modifications to the pre-critical dimensions. ### 3.3 Yet another RoPE extensioN (YaRN)\n\nYaRN (Peng et al., 2024) is the current state-of-theart RoPE scaling method for TSTL. It introduces the \"NTK-by-parts\" scaling for RoPE, which applies different scaling strategies to each RoPE feature according to its temporal wavelength. In a TSTL scenario with scaling factor $s$, YaRN scales the wavelength of the $j$-th RoPE feature $\\lambda_{j}$ to $\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}$ and further fine-tune the model:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}=\\left(1-\\gamma_{j}\\right) s \\lambda_{j}+\\gamma_{j} \\lambda_{j}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{j}$ is a piece-wise function depending on its corresponding wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$, and two hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ :\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n1, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}<L / \\beta \\\\\n0, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}>L / \\alpha \\\\\n\\frac{L / \\lambda_{j}-\\alpha}{\\beta-\\alpha}, & \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n```\n\n#### 5. 3D-RPE: Enhancing Long-Context Modeling Through 3D Rotary Position Encoding (Avg.

In this section, we mainly introduce the basic concept of Bloch Sphere, which corresponds to Eq. (1) in this paper. The Bloch Sphere is a geometric tool to used to represent qubits, typically depicted in a three-dimensional polar coordinate system as a point on the Sphere (see Figure 4. A single quantum state is represented by the following equation in linear algebra:\n\n$$\n|\\phi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers, i.e., $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$.

(10) into Eq. (9), the quantum state representation is denoted as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|\\phi\\rangle & =r_{0}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\theta_{\\alpha}\\right)+\\mathrm{i} \\sin \\left(\\theta_{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)|0\\rangle+r_{1}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\theta_{\\beta}\\right)+\\mathrm{i} \\sin \\left(\\theta_{\\beta}\\right)\\right)|1\\rangle \\\\\n& =r_{0} e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta_{\\alpha}}|0\\rangle+r_{1} e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta_{\\beta}}|1\\rangle \\\\\n& =e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta_{\\alpha}}\\left(r_{0}|0\\rangle+r_{1} e^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\theta_{\\beta}-\\theta_{\\alpha}\\right)}|1\\rangle\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d426bc005c38a790628bg-12.jpg?height=751&width=744&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=688)\n\nFigure 4: A diagram of Bloch Sphere. $\\theta_{\\alpha}$ is the global phase.

(1) of this paper is given out. To adapt to the original 2D rotation position encoding (RoPE) of pre-trained LLMs, such as LLaMA models, the global phase $\\theta$ is used to model the relative positions between tokens within a chunk, while the rotation angle $\\frac{\\varphi}{2}$ is used to model the relative positions between tokens across chunks. ## B Supplementary Material for the Method Section\n\nIn this section, we mainly introduce the specific implementation of our positional encoding method (3D-RPE), and the formula derivation details of attention score calculation (Eq.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Numerical Stability RoPE\", \"Empirical Gated Linear Attention RoPE\", \"Implementing RoPE in Gated Attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, this exponential growth property comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we carefully analyze the limitation of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincar\\'e ball and the Lorentz model. We first show that, under the 64 bit arithmetic system, the Poincar\\'e ball has a relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points. Then, we theoretically validate the superiority of the Lorentz model over the Poincar\\'e ball from the perspective of optimization. Given the numerical limitations of both models, we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate these limitations. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes and exhibits its ability in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2.

Breaking the gridlock in Mixture-of-Experts: Consistent and Efficient Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Empirical Gated Linear Attention RoPE\"*\n\n*Ashok Vardhan Makkuva, P. Viswanath, Sreeram Kannan, Sewoong Oh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the first algorithm that learns the true parameters of a MoE model for a wide class of non-linearities with global consistency guarantees and empirically validate the algorithm on both the synthetic and real data sets in a variety of settings, and show superior performance to standard baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a widely popular model for ensemble learning and is a basic building block of highly successful modern neural networks as well as a component in Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Attention networks. However, present algorithms for learning MoE including the EM algorithm, and gradient descent are known to get stuck in local optima. From a theoretical viewpoint, finding an efficient and provably consistent algorithm to learn the parameters remains a long standing open problem for more than two decades. In this paper, we introduce the first algorithm that learns the true parameters of a MoE model for a wide class of non-linearities with global consistency guarantees. While existing algorithms jointly or iteratively estimate the expert parameters and the gating paramters in the MoE, we propose a novel algorithm that breaks the deadlock and can directly estimate the expert parameters by sensing its echo in a carefully designed cross-moment tensor between the inputs and the output. Once the experts are known, the recovery of gating parameters still requires an EM algorithm; however, we show that the EM algorithm for this simplified problem, unlike the joint EM algorithm, converges to the true parameters. We empirically validate our algorithm on both the synthetic and real data sets in a variety of settings, and show superior performance to standard baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Round and Round We Go! What makes Rotary Positional Encodings useful?\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical Stability RoPE\"*\n\n*Federico Barbero, Alex Vitvitskyi, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107*\n\n**Abstract:** Positional Encodings (PEs) are a critical component of Transformer-based\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), providing the attention mechanism with important\nsequence-position information. One of the most popular types of encoding used\ntoday in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries\nand keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is\nuseful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance\nincreases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason.\nWe study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is\nbeing used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to\nconstruct robust \"positional\" attention patterns by exploiting the highest\nfrequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the\nlowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic\ninformation. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct\nexperiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes\nsome highlighted issues and improves performance. We believe that this work\nrepresents an interesting step in better understanding PEs in LLMs, which we\nbelieve holds crucial value for scaling LLMs to large sizes and context\nlengths.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

MosaicBERT: A Bidirectional Encoder Optimized for Fast Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: \"Empirical Gated Linear Attention RoPE\"*\n\n*Jacob Portes, Alex Trott, Sam Havens, Daniel King, Abhinav Venigalla, Moin Nadeem, Nikhil Sardana, Daya Khudia, Jonathan Frankle*\n\n**Abstract:** Although BERT-style encoder models are heavily used in NLP research, many\nresearchers do not pretrain their own BERTs from scratch due to the high cost\nof training. In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many\nadvances have been made with other transformer architectures and training\nconfigurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here,\nwe introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe\nthat is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture\nincorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear\nUnits (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision\nLayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe\nincludes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective,\nbfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in\naddition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When\npretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a\ndownstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs\nat a cost of roughly $20. We plot extensive accuracy vs. pretraining speed\nPareto curves and show that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto\noptimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large. This empirical\nspeed up in pretraining enables researchers and engineers to pretrain custom\nBERT-style models at low cost instead of finetune on existing generic models.\nWe open source our model weights and code.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-29T06:05:19Z  (*Updated: 2024-01-16T16:03:31Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"Implementing RoPE in Gated Attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Zebra: Extending Context Window with Layerwise Grouped Local-Global Attention (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Kaiqiang Song, Xiaoyang Wang, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoman Pan, Dong Yu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new model architecture, referred to as Zebra, that efficiently manages the quadratic time and memory complexity issues associated with full attention in the Transformer by employing grouped local-global attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing and understanding extensive text sequences, a critical aspect in applications requiring deep comprehension and synthesis of large volumes of information. Recognizing the inherent challenges in extending the context window for LLMs, primarily built on Transformer architecture, we propose a new model architecture, referred to as Zebra. This architecture efficiently manages the quadratic time and memory complexity issues associated with full attention in the Transformer by employing grouped local-global attention layers. Our model, akin to a zebra's alternating stripes, balances local and global attention layers, significantly reducing computational requirements and memory consumption. Comprehensive experiments, including pretraining from scratch, continuation of long context adaptation training, and long instruction tuning, are conducted to evaluate the Zebra's performance. The results show that Zebra achieves comparable or superior performance on both short and long sequence benchmarks, while also enhancing training and inference efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/44 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nHowever, it is important to note that the computational of attention escalates quadratically, leading to a decrease in efficiency as the length of the sequence increases. Consequently, addressing this computational challenge is essential for maintaining effectiveness over longer sequences. Second, the Positional Embedding that imparts a structured signal indicative of the sequential order of tokens. It is vital to employ a positional embedding that is not only robust but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, particularly for processing long sequences. This ensures the model's effectiveness in maintaining sequence integrity over longer spans of data. ### 2.1.1 Attention\n\nIn Figure (1a, 1b, 1c), we showcase three representative variants of single attention layers including global attention, local attention, and local attention with global approximations. Additional sparse attention models like blockwise attention(Qiu et al., 2019), dilated window attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), stride attention (Child et al., 2019), Sinkhorn Attention (Tay et al., 2020a), transient global attention (Guo et al., 2021) are considered potential alternatives for basic local attention. For the sake of clarity and focus in our research, we confine our analysis to two primary variants: local attention and local attention with global approximations. This decision allows for a more targeted exploration of these specific attention mechanisms within our work. Moreover, we also consider using different strategies among different layers. In Figure 1d, we combine several local layers with one global attention layer as a group and stack such groups for the model. Considering one head of the self-attention layer in a decoder-only transformer, the query, key, and value of $i$-th position and $l$-th layer are defined as projections of the last layer hidden states $h_{i}^{(l-1)}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(l)} & =W_{q}^{T} \\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)_{i}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_{i}^{(l)} & =W_{k}^{T} \\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)_{i}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(l)} & =W_{v}^{T} \\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)_{i}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe denote the similarity between $i$-th query and $j$-th key as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{D}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is a normalized factor usually equal to the model dimension. Global Attention: It is the most common attention, where each token has attention to all the positions before it and itself:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{i, j}=\\frac{\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)}{\\sum_{t=0}^{i} \\operatorname{Sim}(i, t)}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1130b80ace813be43d3cg-03.jpg?height=423&width=1600&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=236)\n\nFigure 1: Four different attention strategies to be compared in this work. (a) Global Attention, where each token has its attention to all previous tokens and itself; (b) Local Attention, where each token only has the attention within its local window; (c) Local Attention with Global Approximation is newly introduced in this work, where each token not only has attention to its local window but also has an approximated attention from the remaining non-local chunks; (d) Group Attention is our introduced layerwise grouped local-global attention strategy, where we group $L$ layers and apply the global attention at the first layer of each group (the remaining layers use local attention). where $\\alpha_{i, j}$ is the attention value of $i$-th query over $j$-th key. The context vector is then defined as a weighted sum of value vectors:\n\n$$\n\\text { context }_{i}=\\sum_{j=0}^{i} \\alpha_{i, j} \\mathbf{v}_{j}\n$$\n\nLocal Attention: Each query only considers the key-value pairs within its local window. $$\n\\alpha_{i, j}=\\frac{\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)}{\\sum_{t=\\min (0, i-w)}^{i} \\operatorname{Sim}(i, t)}\n$$\n\nwhere $w$ is the window size of local attention. Local Attention w/ Global Approximation: Inspired by transient global attention (Guo et al., 2021), we approximate the global attention output by combining multiple non-local tokens as a chunk, and take the attention over local tokens and nonlocal chunks. Each non-local chunk's key-value pairs are estimated using the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_{j}=\\sum_{t=(j-1) * c}^{j * c-1} \\mathbf{k}_{t}+\\ln (c) \\\\\n& \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{j}=\\sum_{t=(j-1) * c}^{j * c-1} \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\ln (c)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $c$ is the chunk size, and $\\ln (c)$ is a compensation term for each chunk. Layerwise Grouped Local-Global Attention: Instead of using identical layers for the entire network, we propose to use grouped local-global attention layers. In figure 1 d , we group every $L$ layer and use only one global attention layer at the first layer of each group. We apply local attention described in Equation (7) for the remaining layers. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1130b80ace813be43d3cg-03.jpg?height=105&width=631&top_left_y=2489&top_left_x=267)\n\nTo simplify, we use Group Attention to denote the layerwise grouped local-global attention. ### 2.1.2 Positional Embedding\n\nIn the Transformer architecture, positional embeddings are commonly used to encode the sequence order information. In this study, we incorporate three widely recognized types of positional embeddings to facilitate a comprehensive analysis. Absolute Positional Embedding: The vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) advocates to use an absolute sinusoidal positional embedding:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP E(p o s, 2 i) & =\\sin \\left(p o s / 10000^{2 i / d)}\\right) \\\\\nP E(p o s, 2 i+1) & =\\cos \\left(p o s / 10000^{2 i / d}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere pos is the position index, $d$ is the model dimension, and $i$ is the iterative variable for different dimensions. After the work of the vanilla Transformer, a trainable absolute positional embedding has been introduced (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018), serving as a replacement for the fixed sinusoidal pattern. Such positional embedding is directly added to the semantic embedding:\n\n$$\nE M B(\\text { word, pos })=W E(\\text { word })+P E(\\text { pos })\n$$\n\nwhere word is the input token index, and pos is the absolute position index. Most recently, the relative positional embeddings (Shaw et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019) are introduced to eliminate the positional bias while improving the performance. These approaches also facilitate the model's ability to extend its contextual window, a process known as position extrapolation. Within this framework, two principal types of relative positional embeddings are taken into consideration. Alibi Positional Embedding (Press et al., 2022), which applies the relative positional embedding by directly adding a bias term to the attention matrix. $$\n\\alpha_{i, j}=\\operatorname{Softmax}_{j}^{i}(\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)-(i-j) * m)\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ is a head-specific scalar and $(i-j)$ is the relative distance between query and key positions. By canceling out the $-i * m$ term, we have\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{i, j}=\\operatorname{Softmax}_{j}^{i}(\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)+j * m)\n$$\n\nRotary Positional Embedding (Su et al., 2023) rotates the conjugate dimensions of query and key vectors, such that the relative distance is encoded during the attention calculation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}} & =\\left(W_{q}^{T} \\mathbf{h}_{i}\\right) e^{\\mathbf{i}(i \\theta)} \\\\\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}} & =\\left(W_{k}^{T} \\mathbf{h}_{i}\\right) e^{\\mathbf{i}(i \\theta)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{i}$ denotes the imaginary unit, and $i$ is the positional index. For each pair of conjugate dimensions, the similarity between query and key can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Sim}(i, j)=R E\\left[\\left(W_{q}^{T} \\mathbf{h}_{i}\\right)^{T}\\left(W_{k}^{T} \\mathbf{h}_{j}\\right) e^{\\mathbf{i}(i-j) \\theta}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $R E$ takes the real value of the complex number. The overall similarity is consequently defined as the cumulative measure of similarities across all corresponding dimensions. ### 2.2 Experiments for Model Design\n\n| Model Size | 117 M | 345 M |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Num Layers | 12 | 24 |\n| Hidden Size | 768 | 1024 |\n| Num Heads | 12 | 16 |\n| K-V Channel | 64 | 64 |\n| FF Layer Hidden Size | 3072 | 4096 |\n\nTable 1: Parameters of two models with different sizes. We conduct experiments with various attention strategies and positional embedding methods as described earlier. Two GPT models with 117M and 345M parameters as detailed in Table 1, are trained from scratch to assess different model architectures. The training sequence length used for these experiments ranges from 1024, 4096, to 16384. A $10 \\%$ of the training data from the Pile dataset (Gao et al., 2020) is utilized for model training. Its testing and validation data is used in experiments of this section for evaluation. We employ an Adam Optimizer (Kingma and Ba , 2014) for training with the beta values of 0.9 and 0.99 . The training process spans 20,000 steps with a batch size of 2 M tokens. The initial learning rate is set to $1 e^{-3}$ with a warmup step of 2,000 , followed by linear decay to $1 e^{-5}$. Weight decay is set to 0.01 , and the gradient clipping is set to 1.0 . For the local attention, a window size of $w=1,024$ is applied. For local attention with global approximation, we employ a chunk size of $c=16$. We group every three layers for local and global layers. For rotary embedding (Su et al., 2023), the RoPE theta is configured as 131,072 to enhance its generalization performance on longer sequences. All experiments are implemented using Megatron-LM ${ }^{1}$ (Shoeybi et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021; Korthikanti et al., 2023). ### 2.2.1 Attention\n\nFigure 2 shows the testing perplexity (PPL) difference between each attention strategy and the global attention method on the 117 M model. From the figures, we have a few observations: First, global attention has the best overall performance; Second, the performance gap between group attention and global attention is small but stable when the training sequence length is getting longer; Third, as the training sequence length grows, the performance of local attention and global approximation attention drops a lot for longer sequences, though it may benefit the shorter ones. As group attention has less computation but achieves a similar performance compared to global attention, it has a high scalability potential. To better compare the global and group attention strategies, we take both performance and computation into consideration. In Figure 3, we draw the curve of the estimated TFLOPS and the validation PPL on three different training lengths with DeepSpeed FLOPS profiler ${ }^{2}$ for the 117 M model. We observe that group attention achieves a similar performance with less computation than global attention. When the local window is equal to the training sequence length (i.e., 1 k training length in Figure 3), the gain is negligible. However, as the training sequence gets longer (e.g., 4 k or 16 k training length in Figure 3), the gain becomes magnified. This verifies that group attention has better scalability compared to global attention. ### 2.2.2 Positional Embedding\n\nTable 2 shows the perplexity results comparing different positional embeddings with the 117 M and 345 M models. We find that no significant performance differences are observed among the three positional embeddings for sequence lengths within the training sequence 16,384 . This result is in line with (Taylor et al., 2022; Kazemnejad et al., 2023)\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1130b80ace813be43d3cg-05.jpg?height=359&width=1523&top_left_y=258&top_left_x=245)\n\nFigure 2: The testing PPL gap between each method and the baseline system (global attention) on 1024, 4096, and 16384 training sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 3. Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Franz A.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms.

[^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Xiaoran Liu, Hang Yan, Shuo Zhang, Chen An, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length, and achieves extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n**Abstract:** The extrapolation capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Rotary Position Embedding is currently a topic of considerable interest. The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/39 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n## B. 3 Long CONTEXT VALIDATION\n\nBesides, to validate that our proposed framework can improve the long-range real-world tasks, we also compare the close-ended subtasks included in L-Eval benchmark (An et al. 2023) within 16K context length, including the 16 -shot GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021), TOEFL-QA(Tseng et al., 2016), TopicRetrieval(Li et al., 2023a), QuALITY(Pang et al.||2022), and Coursera(An et al.| 2023). Our method is still capable of these tasks, as shown in Table 5 . For RoPE-based LLMs fine-tuned on pretraining context, namely 4 K tokens, they still have certain effects on these tasks with 16 K context\nsize, which proves one of the claims of our work, that tuning with the original pre-training context can also boost the length extrapolation. This proves that we extrapolate the RoPE-based LLM to a longer context without the disturbance of domain distribution in pre-trained data concerning the change of training context length (Peng et al. 2023). We also report the evaluation results of RoPEbased LLM fine-tuned with longer context, such as 16 K tokens, in Table 3 . Table 4 and Table 5 and the length extrapolation improvement will be further analyzed in Appendix C. |  | GSM | TOEFL | TopicRet | QuALITY | Coursera |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| LLaMA2 7B | 0.00 | 34.94 | 0.00 | 3.96 | 0.00 |\n| NTK fixed $\\alpha=8$ | 5.00 | 34.20 | 31.33 | 34.16 | 21.51 |\n| NTK dynamic | 9.00 | 37.17 | 24.67 | 30.20 | 22.09 |\n| base $=500$ | 4.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 18.32 | 19.19 |\n| base $=500$, log-scaled | 3.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 18.32 | 19.77 |\n| base $=652$ | 6.00 | 16.73 | 0.00 | 13.37 | 11.63 |\n| base $=652$, log-scaled | 6.00 | 16.73 | 0.00 | 16.83 | 11.63 |\n| base $=10000$ | 0.00 | 18.59 | 0.00 | 2.97 | 0.00 |\n| base $=40000$ | 13.00 | 34.20 | 14.67 | 22.77 | 11.63 |\n| base $=80000$ | 11.00 | 36.43 | 29.33 | 23.76 | 15.70 |\n| base $=160000$ | 10.00 | 40.15 | 38.00 | 22.28 | 16.28 |\n| base $=400000$ | 8.00 | 41.64 | 36.67 | 22.77 | 15.70 |\n| base $=600000$ | 12.00 | 38.66 | 34.00 | 25.25 | 16.86 |\n| base $=1000000$ | 9.00 | 31.97 | 34.00 | 21.29 | 16.28 |\n| base $=2000000$ | 7.00 | 30.86 | 31.33 | 22.77 | 15.70 |\n| base $=500,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 2.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 16.83 | 20.35 |\n| base $=10000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 5.00 | 42.38 | 0.00 | 19.80 | 13.95 |\n| base $=40000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 11.00 | 43.49 | 20.67 | 28.22 | 19.19 |\n| base $=80000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 12.00 | 43.49 | 35.33 | 30.20 | 21.51 |\n| base $=120000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 14.00 | 43.12 | 40.00 | 26.24 | 20.93 |\n| base $=1000000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 13.00 | 44.24 | 41.33 | 25.74 | 21.51 |\n| LLaMA2 13B | 0.00 | 59.48 | 0.00 | 6.44 | 0.00 |\n| NTK fixed $\\alpha=8$ | 8.00 | 58.74 | 36.00 | 35.64 | 23.26 |\n| NTK dynamic | 22.00 | 59.85 | 30.00 | 35.15 | 28.49 |\n| base $=500$ | 9.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 30.20 | 25.58 |\n| base $=500$, log-scaled | 11.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 28.71 | 25.58 |\n| base $=652$ | 12.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 30.69 | 25.58 |\n| base $=652$, log-scaled | 9.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 31.19 | 25.00 |\n| base $=10000$ | 0.00 | 56.13 | 0.00 | 7.43 | 0.00 |\n| base $=40000$ | 18.00 | 64.68 | 20.67 | 49.01 | 16.86 |\n| base $=80000$ | 20.00 | 63.94 | 30.00 | 52.97 | 24.42 |\n| base $=160000$ | 23.00 | 62.83 | 39.33 | 51.49 | 24.42 |\n| base $=400000$ | 17.00 | 59.48 | 34.67 | 51.49 | 29.07 |\n| base $=600000$ | 14.00 | 63.94 | 36.00 | 47.52 | 29.65 |\n| base $=1000000$ | 10.00 | 64.68 | 28.67 | 45.05 | 19.19 |\n| base $=500,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 6.00 | 20.07 | 0.00 | 21.29 | 26.74 |\n| base $=10000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 13.00 | 55.39 | 0.00 | 38.61 | 25.00 |\n| base $=40000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 25.00 | 63.94 | 19.33 | 49.50 | 18.60 |\n| base $=80000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 21.00 | 63.20 | 34.67 | 40.10 | 15.12 |\n| base $=120000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 22.00 | 63.94 | 40.67 | 39.11 | 19.19 |\n| base $=1000000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 9.00 | 63.57 | 33.33 | 48.02 | 16.86 |\n\nTable 5: Long context validation results of scaling RoPE with different base and other extrapolating methods in LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b).

Surprisingly, as the base increases from 500 to 1000000, the extrapolation capability first becomes weaker and then becomes stronger. ## C EXTENSION\n\nConcerning that the current extrapolation methods in the fine-tuning phase dominantly apply longer tuning contexts, we propose an extended version of the scaling law of RoPE-based extrapolation. Theorem 3. (Extended Scaling Law of RoPE-based Extrapolation) For RoPE-based LLMs pretrained with context length $T_{\\text {train }}$ and critical dimension $d_{\\text {extra }}$, if we adjust the base to $\\beta$ and then conduct fine-tuning with context length $T_{\\text {tune }} \\geq T_{\\text {train }}$, the extrapolation performance of RoPE-based LLMs will get improved. Importantly, there exists a critical base $\\beta_{0}$ decided by $T_{\\text {tune }}$ and $T_{\\text {train }}$. $$\n\\beta_{0}=10000^{\\log _{\\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{} \\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}}^{2 \\pi}}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta>\\beta_{0}$, the extrapolation upper bound is decided by $\\beta$ and $d_{\\text {extra }}$ as follows:\n\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{extra}}=2 \\pi \\cdot \\beta^{d_{\\mathrm{extra}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{d}}=2 \\pi \\cdot \\beta^{\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil \\cdot \\frac{2}{d}}\n$$\n\nOtherwise, the extrapolation upper bound is $T_{\\text {tune }}$ and the critical dimension is updated satisfying\n\n$$\nd_{\\text {extra }}^{\\prime}=2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{\\beta} \\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil \\geq 2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil=d_{\\text {extra }}\n$$\n\nHowever, the extrapolation beyond $T_{\\text {tune }}$ will acquire further enhancement if $\\beta$ gets smaller. Particularly, when $\\beta$ is smaller than $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3}$ as follows, the enhancement will be more significant. $$\n\\beta_{1}=\\frac{2 T_{\\text {tune }}}{\\pi}, \\quad \\beta_{2}=\\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{\\pi}, \\quad \\beta_{3}=\\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nTheorem 3. serves as both a combination and generalization of Theorem 1., Lemma 1. and Theorem 2. Here, the critical base is the worst base for extrapolation as well as the smallest base forcing RoPE to extrapolate depending on the feature dimensions within the critical dimension. Specifically, when $T_{\\text {tune }}=T_{\\text {train }}$, the critical base, $\\beta_{0}=10000$, relates to the intriguing observation outlined in Section 2. Equation 13 corresponds to tuning RoPE with larger bases discussed in Section 3.3, Equation 14 corresponds to the definition of critical dimension in Section 3.2 and Equation 15 corresponds to tuning RoPE with smaller bases discussed in Section 3.1 If $T_{\\text {tune }}>T_{\\text {train }}$, RoPE-based LLMs can accommodate a broader context window. As illustrated in Figure 9, when fine-tuning LLaMA2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023b) within a 16K context, the max context length exceeds or equals 16 K , surpassing the original LLaMA2 7B and 13B respectively, regardless of the base value. From a periodic perspective, since both base and training length have changed, it prompts us to consider whether additional positional information has been integrated during the fine-tuning phase for feature dimensions beyond the critical dimension, namely the 92nd dimension for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023b), as indicated in Equation 5 According to the definition of the critical dimension, based on the current base $\\beta$, we can calculate how many dimensions the RoPE-based LLM has where $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ complete a period within the tuning length. If base $\\beta>\\beta_{0}$, then $\\tilde{d}_{\\text {extra }}$, the\nnumber of dimensions that cover a period during fine-tuning have already been able to traverse a complete period during pre-training, given that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil=d_{\\text {extra }}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-22.jpg?height=119&width=1140&top_left_y=385&top_left_x=449)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-22.jpg?height=148&width=876&top_left_y=498&top_left_x=798)\n\nTherefore, the critical dimension remains unchanged. Referring to Theorem 2 in Section 3.3 , we can calculate the extrapolation upper bound based on the updated base and the original critical dimension as Equation 13, exactly the same as Equation 5. For LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) fine-tuned with a 16 K context, as illustrated in Figure 9, the critical base is 71738 , given Equation 12 For bases greater than 71738 , such as 80000,120000 , and 1000000 , their extrapolation upper bounds surpass 16 K and the larger base corresponds to a longer context, corroborating our theoretical framework. If base $\\beta \\leq \\beta_{0}$, then during the fine-tuning phase, the number of dimensions able to complete a period surpasses the original critical dimension, so the critical dimension is updated as Equation 14 Besides, since this dimension depends on the fine-tuning length, the extrapolation upper bound is still constrained within the fine-tuning length $T_{\\text {tune }}$. However, if $\\beta$ is so small that the input of every $\\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}, \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}$ can span values from 0 to $\\pi / 2, \\pi$, or $2 \\pi$ within the fine-tuning length $T_{\\text {tune }}$, as indicated by Equation 15, similar to Theorem 1 in Section 3.1, then the extrapolation performance will get further improved, marked by a more stable perplexity growth curve. For LLaMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023b) fine-tuned with a 16K context, as shown in Figure 9 for bases smaller than the critical base 71738 , such as $60000,20000,10000$, and 500 , the performance curves become progressively more stable. Among them, although $\\beta=10000$ performs poorly in fine-tuning at the original context length, the performance gets significantly improved this time because the inputs of cos or $\\sin$ have traversed to $\\pi / 2$ within the 16 K context length. When $\\beta=500$, LLaMA2 achieved a similar terrific performance as $\\beta=1000000$, namely the design of Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), a context length with at least 100 K tokens, breaking the curse of entropy explosion mentioned in Han et al. (2023). Since there exists an upper bound for extrapolation based on $\\beta=1000000$, RoPE tuned with base 500 on 16 K context length has the potential to extrapolate to an infinite context, thus answering Q3 in the Introduction. Similarly, we also use scatter plots to visualize the fluctuation of attention scores for different bases after fine-tuning with a 16 K context as illustrated in Figure 10 . For base 500, given its exposure to enough fluctuations during the training phase, the perplexity curve remains notably stable. For base 10000 , it is clear that the fluctuation of attention scores in the last 36 dimensions is somewhat limited, leading to a noticeable improvement in extrapolation performance given Equation 15 For base 40000 , the position information acquired in the fine-tuning phase shrinks further as the base increases. For base 120000, the critical dimension goes back to 92 dimensions, and the extrapolation performance is governed by the first 92 dimensions. Remarkably, the extrapolation upper bound given Equation 13 matches the maximum supported context length. For base 1000000, the period of the first 92 dimensions is further extended, corresponding to a context length expanding beyond 100K. Eventually, based on the above interpretation, we validate the correctness of Theorem 3. and provide a unified framework to explain the extrapolation of RoPE-based LLM with arbitrary base and fine-tuning context length. ## D DISCUSSION\n\nBesides, we discuss the instructive value of our theory for other extrapolation strategies focused on achieving longer context during the testing phase. These methods are still necessary given two facts. On one hand, the performance of RoPE with a smaller base is still left behind compared with RoPE with much larger bases, such as 1000000 , as shown in Figure 1 . On the other hand, for RoPE with a base that is not large enough, it still can not extrapolate to a context of 100 K or longer as shown in Figure 2. In order to further enhance RoPE's adaptability to a longer context, whatever the base\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-23.jpg?height=692&width=1355&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=383)\n\nFigure 10: The relation between attention scores in first 92 and last 36 dimensions with the extrapolation performance in LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) evaluated or fine-tuned with different bases at 16 K context length. The meaning of each row is the same as that in Figure 6except that the second row highlights the changes in the first 32 K tokens instead of the first 16 K tokens. value is, we discuss the effect of two complementary methods in the inference phase, log-scaled attention (Su, 2023b) and dynamic-scaled RoPE (bloc97, 2023a) on RoPE with different bases. Log-scaled Attention as shown in Equation 16 is a classic technique originally raised in Chiang \\& Cholak (2022) and currently applied in RoPE-based extrapolation (Su, 2023b, Alibaba, 2023). It involves multiplying the original attention matrix by the logarithm of the current inference length $t$. Traditionally, the base of the logarithm is training length $T_{\\text {train }}$. However, given Equation 13 in Theorem 3., the attention score within the max supported context length $T_{\\text {extra }}$ is reliable. So we take $T_{\\text {extra }}$ as the logarithm base and set the lower limit for the logarithmic correction value as 1 , meaning that no additional $\\log$ scale is required within the extrapolation upper bound. $$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\cdot p_{t} \\\\\np_{t}=\\max \\left(1, \\log _{T_{\\text {exta }}} t\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nBesides Log-scaled attention, window method, such as sliding window and its variant, is also a widely accepted strategy for extrapolation, used in inference or evaluation (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). Compared with the above strict window-based method, we follow the xPos method proposed in Sun et al. (2023), shown in Equation 17, originally used in the pre-training phase. In this work, we regard this method as a soft sliding window used in the inference phase as use it as a further complement to the log-scaled method. Still, we do little modification besides using the $T_{\\text {extra }}$ as the denominator instead of the original denominator $T_{\\text {train }}$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} \\zeta_{n}^{\\frac{t-s}{T_{\\text {extra }}}} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\zeta_{n}=\\frac{\\gamma+2 n / d}{\\gamma+1}, n=0 \\cdots \\frac{d}{2}-1, \\gamma=0.4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDynamic-scaled RoPE namely Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) is a widely used extrapolation. Here, we only do two little modifications. One is to change the base 10000 in vanilla RoPE ( Su et al., 2021) with the base scaled in the fine-tuning phase, $\\beta$. The other is still to replace the $T_{\\text {train }}$ in Equation ?? with $T_{\\text {extra }}$ we derive given Equation 13 in Theorem 3. $$\n\\text { for } \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}, \\theta_{n}=\\left(\\beta \\cdot \\alpha_{t}\\right)^{-2 n / d}, \\text { where } \\alpha_{t}=\\max \\left(1,2^{\\left\\lceil\\log _{2} \\frac{t}{T_{\\text {extra }}}\\right\\rceil+1}-1\\right)\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-24.jpg?height=1221&width=1329&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=396)\n\nFigure 11: Perplexity on the validation data from Books3 dataset (Presser, 2020) of LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al. 2023b) based on RoPE with different bases enhanced with log-scaled attention, xPos and dynamic-scaled RoPE and their combination. Here, wrong means calculating $\\alpha_{t}$ in Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) or $p_{t}$ in (Su, 2023b) with training length $T_{\\text {train }}$, while correct means using extrapolation upper bound $T_{\\text {extra }}$ instead of $T_{\\text {train }}$. We experiment with these two methods on LLaMA2 7B (Touvron et al. 2023b) and get the results as shown in Figure 11. Figure 11a shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with base 10000. It is clear that both log-scaled attention almost does nothing for pre-trained and fine-tuned LLaMA2, but show great improvement for fine-tuning LLaMA2 with cutting the last 36 dimensions in $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{s}$ off. This phenomenon further proves that the fluctuation coming from the dimensions of $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{s}$ beyond the critical dimension is the root cause of the extrapolation problem of RoPE-based LLM. Figure 11b shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with bases smaller than 10000. There is a clear trend that with the reduction of the base value, the improvement obtained from the log-scaled attention is more dominant while the effect of Dynamic NTK shrinks gradually. For RoPE with base 500 , the perplexity curve of log-scaled RoPE is flat enough, indicating the extrapolation capability to support 100 K context length. On the contrary, Dynamic NTK shows a clear side effect. Hence, the position information learned in the training phase is reliable enough for LLM to extrapolate further, corresponding to Theorem 1. in Section 3.1\nFigure 11 c shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with bases larger than 10000, such as 40000, 160000, 400000, and 600000. We do not test the performance of two methods on RoPE with base 1000000 , since it already achieved the context length of 100 K . Here, we enable RoPE with bases larger than 10000 and smaller than 1000000 to extrapolate beyond the context length of 100 K in the inference phase. For RoPE with larger bases, the improvement of extrapolation performance\nobtained from Dynamic NTK is more remarkable. The working principle of Dynamic NTK has been visualized in Figure 8 and discussed in Section 3.4\n\nBesides, replacing the $T_{\\text {train }}$ with $d_{\\text {extra }}$ becomes significantly important for RoPE with larger bases. For example, if Dynamic NTK is carried out based on $T_{\\text {train }}$, the improvement will be limited and even destroyed when the base is large enough like 400000 and 600000. This phenomenon proves the guidance value of this work for other extrapolation works. In conclusion, for a base smaller than $\\beta_{3}$ defined in Equation 1, every dimension has learned complete positional information. Then the log-scaled method is sufficient to enhance extrapolation. For a base larger than $\\beta_{0}$, namely 10000 for tuning on the original context, Dynamic NTK in the correct way is a good helper for extrapolation to a much longer context. ## E TEXT CONTINUATION\n\nFinally, we execute a text continuation as our case study. For LLaMA2 7B(Touvron et al., 2023b) fine-tuned with various base values and fine-tuning lengths, we provide a context of 32 K tokens from Books3(Presser, 2020) and prompt the model to continue writing. The resulting texts, after cleaning the special characters, are shown in Figure 12. Remarkably, whether the base is set at 500 or 1000000 , the generated text remains coherent, grammatically accurate, and logically consistent. For base 500, extended tuning length or incorporating log-scaled attention $\\mathrm{Su}(2023 \\mathrm{~b}$ ) in the testing phase yields improved continuation results. Given the strict extrapolation upper bound for base 1000000, there is a compelling case that a model fine-tuned with base 500 possesses an infinite extrapolation potential. ## LIMITATION\n\nIn this work, our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which RoPE, using either smaller or larger bases, enhances extrapolation performance. Additionally, there remains a need to find whether there exist upper and lower bounds for adjusting the base. Besides, it needs additional efforts to integrate the performance of RoPE with smaller bases in the pre-training stage. Finally, since the base value and pre-training context length are keys to extrapolation, there might be an optimal pair of base and training length for RoPE-based LLM pre-training to be discovered.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/39 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nThe mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_{n}=10000^{-2 n / d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by critical dimension for extrapolation. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023b). # 1 INTRODUCTION \n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become the dominant architecture in a variety of natural language processing tasks (OpenAI, 2023, Touvron et al., 2023a b), while Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) based on Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al. 2021) have become the dominant backbone in wide range of LLM design (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Touvron et al. 2023a b). While RoPE can theoretically represent sequences through trigonometric functions, as detailed in Appendix A, its performance drops when the input sequence or context length surpasses the training length(Press et al. 2022, Chen et al., 2023), seen in Figure 1 This extrapolation problem (Press et al., 2022) limits tasks like long text modeling and summarization (An et al., 2023). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-01.jpg?height=405&width=1405&top_left_y=1878&top_left_x=360)\n\nFigure 1: Perplexity on Books3 (Presser 2020 with different extrapolation methods, including Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023b). RoPE fine-tuned with a smaller or larger base on the original training length of 4 K or a much longer context of 16 K , could outperform other extrapolation strategies and extrapolate to 100 K context length. [^0]Concerning the extrapolation issue with RoPE, different works have provided various interpretations and corresponding solving attempts. These works could divided into two schools of thought. One limits the scope of self-attention (Ratner et al. 2022; Han et al. 2023) given the fact that RoPE-based self-attention fails to keep stable beyond training context and exhibits attention score explosion as well as monotonous entropy increase (Chen et al., 2023, Han et al. 2023). The other aims to capture longer contexts with smaller rotation angles and longer fine-tuning context (Chen et al., 2023, Peng et al., 2023). Current popular methods, such as Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) and Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), mainly come from the second approach. Both approaches adapt RoPE to longer contexts with a larger rotary base. Specifically, Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) adjusts the base with a coefficient increasing with the length of inference, allowing RoPE-based LLMs to adapt simultaneously to longer context, while Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) directly sets the base at 1000000 and gets further trained on 16 K context length, yielding a context beyond 100 K . While recent studies have shown promising results, they have primarily focused on specific base values and tuning context lengths. This leaves a notable gap in understanding how base value, tuning length, and extrapolation performance relate. For instance, while larger bases improve extrapolation in models like LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023a), surprisingly, we also find that fine-tuning with smaller bases with the original training length is also conducive to the extrapolation capability of LLaMA2, which is also demonstrated in Figure 1 Furthermore, when trained in a longer context, RoPE with a smaller base can match or even surpass those with a larger one. At the same time, finetuning with a base of 1000000 on the original training length also achieves extrapolation up to 100 K . These findings pose several questions. Q1: Is 10000 the worst base value for extrapolation in the fine-tuning phase? Q2: Is there a mathematical relationship between rotary base, training context length, and extrapolation limit? Q3: If so, can we achieve unbound extrapolation accordingly? In this paper, we conduct further experiments on increasing and decreasing the rotary base in Section 2 and subsequently discover that adjusting the rotary base in both directions can contribute to the extrapolation of RoPE-based LLMs. Building upon these observations, we provide a comprehensive explanation for the seemingly counter-intuitive phenomenon from a periodic perspective. Meanwhile, we establish a unified theoretical framework for RoPE-based extrapolation known as the Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation ${ }^{11}$. We pinpoint specific changes during base reduction that lead to a significant boost in extrapolation in Section 3.1 and identify the upper bound of extrapolation for larger bases in Section 3.3. This clarifies how Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al. 2023) manages a 100 K extrapolation with only 16 K training context. Furthermore, we validate our theories in Section 3.4 and Appendix C, shedding light on both the core principles of Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) and pinpointing instability sources self-attention computations in RoPE-based extrapolation (Han et al. 2023). Finally, we present the contributions and guiding significance of this work for other methods that achieve extrapolation during the inference phase. In summary, our contributions are as follows, and codes are available athttps://github.com/OpenLMLab/scaling-rope\n\n- We first highlight a surprisingly strange phenomenon 10000 is the worst base value for RoPE-based extrapolation in the fine-tuning phase. Remarkably, fine-tuning with either a larger or smaller base within the training context length greatly enhances extrapolation, which provides a new vision to the extrapolation research of RoPE (Su et al., 2021). - Then we introduce a unified theoretical framework for RoPE-based extrapolation from a periodic perspective, known as the Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation, which not only clarifies the aforementioned observations and addresses unanswered questions in existing research (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), but also discover the Critical Dimension for RoPEbased Extrapolation, revealing the underlying reasons for the extrapolation issue of RoPE. - Finally, for extrapolation within a defined context, we present the suggested fine-tuning base value determined by the context limit and extend the context of LLaMA2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023b) to surpass 100 K tokens by tuning RoPE with base 1000000 and 4 K tuning length. For unpredictable extrapolation, we propose a RoPE with a smaller base, such as 500 , and achieve an almost 1 M token context with a mere 16 K tuning length.

Figure 3: Perplexity of smaller bases on Books3 (Presser, 2020) shows better extrapolation. ## 2 ObSERVATION\n\n### 2.1 Larger BASES Promise Better EXTRAPOLATION\n\nWe first conduct the extrapolation experiments with larger bases, based on the experimental setup in Appendix B.1. It is evident that tuning with larger bases could significantly improve the extrapolation performance of RoPE as shown in Figure 2. Besides, there are several noteworthy points. First, Larger bases allow LLaMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023b) to extrapolate beyond its training context length, aligning with findings from Rozi\u00e8re et al. (2023). Secondly, the extrapolation with larger bases has a clear limit where language modeling perplexity stays consistent. Beyond this limit, the extrapolation performance declines significantly. Furthermore, as the base value rises, LLaMA2 can extrapolate to a longer context. Finally, compared to Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a), RoPE tuned with larger bases degrades much quicker beyond its extrapolation upper bound. Therefore, for finetuning with larger bases, the performance beyond the upper bound could be consistently overtaken by Dynamic NTK. Nevertheless, within the upper bound, this approach still outperforms Dynamic NTK by a considerable margin, leading to a context beyond 100 K with only a 4 K tuning length, when the base is set over 600000 . ### 2.2 Smaller Bases Also Promise Better Extrapolation\n\nWe then conduct the extrapolation experiments with smaller bases, using the same setup as for larger bases. Interestingly, even though this goes against common research findings (bloc97, 2023a, Rozi\u00e8re et al. 2023), fine-tuning RoPE with smaller bases on the original context length still boosts extrapolation, as shown in Figure 3 It also extends the context window beyond the training length. Yet, there are distinct differences when comparing RoPE with smaller bases to larger ones. Firstly, RoPE with smaller bases does not have a distinct upper bound of extrapolation. While perplexity worsens as context length grows, this decline is gentler with smaller bases. Secondly, the enhancement in extrapolation of RoPE with smaller bases is not uniform. Between a base of 10000 and 8000 , the extrapolation performance exhibits a tiny improvement. Then between a base of 8000 and 2608 , improvement is moderate. After that, from 2608 to 1304 and further to 652 , the improvement becomes more pronounced. Finally, when the rotary base is 500, the extrapolation curve becomes sufficiently smooth thus resulting in strong extrapolation over 48 K context length and superior performance over Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a). Combining these two results, we observe a surprisingly strange phenomenon in RoPE-based extrapolation as depicted in Figure 4 Specifically, base 10000 yields the worst extrapolation performance when fine-tuned, thus answering Q1 in the Introduction.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's primary goal is to integrate Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) into Gated Linear Attention (GLA) mechanisms, specifically within the FastTTTLinear GAU, to enhance its performance while ensuring computational efficiency and numerical stability.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple.

In performing the NLP tasks, the maximal length of the sequences (the context window) determined by its training processes has been one of the major limits of a pretrained LLM. Being able to dynamically extend the context window via a small amount of fine-tuning (or without fine-tuning) has become more and more desirable. To this end, the position encodings of transformers are the center of the discussions. The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding [15]. Since then, relative positional encoding schemes [32] have further increased the performance of Transformers. Currently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [30], RoPE [34], XPos [35], and ALiBi [27]. One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training. While some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length [22]. Some works have been done to overcome such limitation. [9] and concurrently [21] proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative, [6] proposed the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into account. Since then, two improvements of the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation have been proposed, with different emphasis:\n\n- the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation method [14] for pre-trained models without fine-tuning. - the \"NTK-by-parts\" interpolation method [7] which performs the best when fine-tuned on a small amount of longer-context data. The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation and the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation have already seen their presence in the open-source models such as Code Llama [31] (using \"NTK-aware\" interpolation) and Qwen 7B [2] (using \"Dynamic NTK\"). In this paper, in addition to making a complete account of the previous unpublished works on the \"NTK-aware\", the \"Dynamic NTK\" and the \"NTK-by-part\" interpolations, we present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), an improved method to efficiently extend the context window of models trained with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) including the LLaMA [38], the GPTNeoX [5], and the PaLM [10] families of models. YaRN reaches state-of-the-art performances in context window extensions after fine-tuning on less than $\\sim 0.1 \\%$ of the original pre-training data. In the meantime, by combining with the inference-time technique called Dynamic Scaling, the Dynamic-YaRN allows for more than 2x context window extension without any fine-tuning. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Rotary Position Embeddings\n\nThe basis of our work is the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduced in [34]. We work on a hidden layer where the set of hidden neurons are denoted by $D$. Given a sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}$, following the notation of [34], the attention layer first converts the vectors into the query vectors and the key vectors:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{m}=f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}=f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nNext, the attention weights are calculated as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{|D|}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_{m}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ are considered as column vectors so that $\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ is simply the Euclidean inner product. In RoPE, we first assume that $|D|$ is even and identify the embedding space and the hidden states as\ncomplex vector spaces:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{|D| / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere the inner product $\\mathbf{q}^{T} \\mathbf{k}$ becomes the real part of the standard Hermitian inner product $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\mathbf{k}\\right)$. More specifically, the isomorphisms interleave the real part and the complex part\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo convert embeddings $\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}$ into query and key vectors, we are first given $\\mathbb{R}$-linear operators\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}: \\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nIn complex coordinates, the functions $f_{q}, f_{k}$ are given by\n\n$$\nf_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right)=e^{i m \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{q} \\mathbf{x}_{m}, f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)=e^{i n \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{|D| / 2}\\right)$ is the diagonal matrix with $\\theta_{d}=b^{-2 d /|D|}$ and $b=10000$. This way, RoPE associates each (complex-valued) hidden neuron with a separate frequency $\\theta_{d}$. The benefit of doing so is that the dot product between the query vector and the key vector only depends on the relative distance $m-n$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}} \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{q}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n} e^{i \\theta(m-n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn real coordinates, the RoPE can be written using the following function\n$f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\\cos m \\theta_{1} & -\\sin m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sin m \\theta_{1} & \\cos m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & -\\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\cos m \\theta_{l} & -\\sin m \\theta_{l} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\sin m \\theta_{l} & \\cos m \\theta_{l}\\end{array}\\right) \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{m}$\nso that\n\n$$\nf_{q}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{q}}, f_{k}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{k}}\n$$\n\n### 2.2 Position Interpolation\n\nAs language models are usually pre-trained with a fixed context length, it is natural to ask how to extend the context length by fine-tuning on relatively less amount of data. For language models using RoPE as the position embedding, Chen et al. [9], and concurrently kaiokendev [21] proposed the Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context length beyond the pre-trained limit. While a direct extrapolation does not perform well on sequences $w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{L}$ with $L$ larger than the pre-trained limit, they discovered that interpolating the position indicies within the pre-trained limit works well with the help of a small amount of fine-tuning. Specifically, given a pre-trained language model with RoPE, they modify the RoPE by\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\frac{m L}{L^{\\prime}}, \\theta_{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L^{\\prime}>L$ is a new context window beyond the pre-trained limit. With the original pre-trained model plus the modified RoPE formula, they fine-tuned the language model further on several orders of magnitude fewer tokens (a few billion in Chen et al. [9]) and successfully acheived context window extension. ### 2.3 Additional Notation\n\nThe ratio between the extended context length and the original context length has been of special importance, and we introduce the notation $s$ defined by\n\n$$\ns=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{L}\n$$\n\nand we call $s$ the scale factor. We also rewrite and simplify Eq. 10 into the following general form:\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ are method-dependent functions. For PI, we have $g(m)=m / s, h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)=\\theta_{d}$. In the subsequent sections, when we introduce a new interpolation method, we sometimes only specify the functions $g(m)$ and $h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$. Additionally, we define $\\lambda_{d}$ as the wavelength of the RoPE embedding at $d$-th hidden dimension:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{d}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{d}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 d}{|D|}}\n$$\n\nThe wavelength describes the length of tokens needed in order for the RoPE embedding at dimension $d$ to perform a full rotation $(2 \\pi)$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, even with their remarkable capacity, these LLMs remain restricted by pre-defined context window sizes, suffering from notable performance decline when input tokens exceeds these limits. Nevertheless, numerous application scenarios demand extremely long input sequences, including long document summarization (Huang et al., 2021), in-context learning with numerous examples ( Li et al., 2023), and long document retrieval (Zhou et al., 2022), etc. This naturally poses a significant challenge of context window extension: Extending the context window of a pre-trained LLM to accommodate longer sequences. Naively fine-tuning LLMs on inputs of target length for window extension has received limited success due to the large disruption introduced by new position indices (Chen et al., 2023a; Han et al., 2023). Addressing this, Position Interpolation (Chen et al., 2023a; kaiokendev, 2023; Peng et al., 2023) propose to down-scale the position indices to match the original window size, yielding improved results for context extension. However, these methods still rely on Full-length fine-tuning, i.e., finetuning with context of target length, which is memory and time-intensive due to the computational complexity that increases quadratically with input length. For example, Chen et al. (2023a) use 32 A100 GPUs to extend LLaMA models from 2 k to 8 k context, and 128 A100 GPUs for even larger context. These overhead has made it impossible to extend context window to extreme lengths.

PoSE fine-tuning for extending the context window size from 2,048 to 8,192 . At each iteration, the former directly takes 8,192 tokens for fine-tuning, while PoSE manipulates the position indices of 2,048 tokens to simulate longer inputs. For example, we partition the original context window of 2,048 tokens into two chunks, and adjust the position indices of the second chunk by adding a distinct skipping bias term. These bias terms, as well as the length of each chunk, are altered for each training example, so that the model can adapt to all relative positions of the target context window through fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) fine-tuning to decouple the fine-tuning length from the target context window length, unleashing the possibility of efficiently extending context window to an extreme size. The key idea of PoSE is to simulate long inputs by manipulating position indices within a fixed context window. As depicted in Figure 1, we partition the original context window into several chunks, and adjust the position indices of each chunk by adding a distinct skipping bias term. These bias terms, as well as the length of each chunk, are altered for each training example, so that the model can adapt to all positions (including both absolute and relative) within the target context window through fine-tuning. Meanwhile, by maintaining continuous position indices within each chunk, PoSE bears a close resemblance to pre-training. As a result, the model's pre-trained capacity for language modeling and comprehension is retained to the greatest degree. The advantages of our PoSE are threefold: 1) Memory and Time Efficiency: By only requiring the original context size for fine-tuning, PoSE circumvents the quadratic increase in computational complexity with respect to target length during the fine-tuning stage, thereby significantly reducing memory and time overhead. 2) Potential for Extremely-Long Context: We manage to extend the context window of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) by up to 64 times $(2 \\mathrm{k} \\rightarrow 128 \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{k}=1,024)$ while preserving decent ability of language modeling and understanding. 3) Compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and PI strategies: The effectiveness of PoSE has been empirically validated across several representative RoPE-based LLMs, including LLaMA, LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), GPT-J (Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021), and Baichuan (Baichuan, 2023). Additionally, PoSE has been demonstrated to be compatible with a variety of position interpolation methods, including Linear (Chen et al., 2023a), NTK (Peng \\& Quesnelle, 2023), and YaRN (Peng et al., 2023) interpolation. Notably, by decoupling the fine-tuning and target length, PoSE can theoretically extend context window to an infinite length. The only constraint is the memory usage during the inference phase. Hopefully, with the continuous advancements in efficient inference techniques, including Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), xFormers (Lefaudeux et al., 2022), vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), etc, we believe PoSE can promisingly push the context window size to a even larger scale. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nTraining Length-Extrapolatable Models. Length extrapolation requires the model to handle continually increasing input tokens, even beyond the context window size used for training (Press et al., 2021). To this end, a series of positional embedding schemes have been proposed, including ALibi (Press et al., 2021), xPos (Sun et al., 2023), NoPos (Haviv et al., 2022), etc. Similar to our work, Ruoss et al. (2023) also attempted to simulate longer sequences during training time to mitigate out-of-distribution lengths. They proposed randomized positional encoding\n(RandPos), which randomly selected an ordered subset of position indices from longer sequences. Our proposed method, PoSE, diverges from their approach in several key aspects: First, RandPos is a positional embedding scheme designed to pre-train encoder-only models from scratch for length extrapolation. In contrast, PoSE is a fine-tuning method aiming at efficiently extend the context window of pre-trained LLMs, which are majorly decoder-only models. Second, in RandPos, the position indices between adjacent tokens are not continuous. However, in PoSE, the position indices within each chunk are intentionally made continuous to resemble the pre-training phase, therefore reducing the risk of disrupting the language modeling abilities learned during pre-training. Fine-tuning LLMs for Longer Context. Differing from length extrapolation, which primarily involves training a model from scratch to support lengths exceeding those it was initially trained for, context window extension focuses on extending the context window of a pre-trained LLM. Directly fine-tuning an existing LLM with a longer context window has been shown to progress slowly (Chen et al., 2023a). To expedite and stabilize training, Chen et al. (2023a) first down-scaled position indices to match original context size through Linear Position Interpolation. Subsequently, a range of Positional Interpolation (PI) strategies have been introduced, including NTK (Peng \\& Quesnelle, 2023) and YaRN (Peng et al., 2023). More recently, LongLora (Chen et al., 2023b) propose shift short attention to approximate full attention. However, all these methods require Full-length fine-tuning, suffering computational cost that grows with target context size. By contrast, our method managed to decouple train / target length, requiring only the original context size for fine-tuning. Memory Transformers. An alternative strategy for extremely long input sequences involves memory mechanisms. Typically, there are two lines of research for utilizing memory: the recurrencebased approach (Dai et al., 2019; Bulatov et al., 2022) and the retrieval-based approach (Wu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Tworkowski et al., 2023). The former segments long inputs and reuses the hidden states of preceding segments as memory, suffering from information loss and limited capacity for random access. The latter encodes prior sequences as (key, value) pairs and utilizes a memory retriever and reader to extract previously encoded information, primarily limited by the lack of interaction between discrete memory segments. More recently, Mohtashami \\& Jaggi (2023) introduced landmark attention to facilitates random access to any chunk of the input. In contrast, our method achieves full access to the entire input without any modifications to the attention mechanism. ## 3 METHODOLOGY\n\n### 3.1 PRELIMINARIES\n\nRotary Position Embedding (RoPE). The use of RoPE (Su et al., 2021) has become pervasive in contemporary LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), GPT-J (Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021), etc. It encodes position information of tokens with a rotation matrix that naturally incorporates explicit relative position dependency. To elucidate, given a hidden vector $\\boldsymbol{h}=\\left[h_{0}, h_{1}, \\ldots, h_{d-1}\\right]$, where $d$ is the hidden dimension, and a position index $m$, RoPE operates as follows:\n\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{h}, m)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nh_{0} \\\\\nh_{1} \\\\\nh_{2} \\\\\nh_{3} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nh_{d-2} \\\\\nh_{d-1}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\cos m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{d / 2-1} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{d / 2-1}\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n-h_{1} \\\\\nh_{0} \\\\\n-h_{3} \\\\\nh_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n-h_{d-1} \\\\\nh_{d-2}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\sin m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{d / 2-1} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{d / 2-1}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta_{j}=10000^{-2 j / d}, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d / 2-1\\}$. Unlike previous absolute position encodings that are directly applied to the input vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, RoPE is employed on the query and key vectors at each layer. Given a query $\\boldsymbol{q}$ at position $m$ and a key $\\boldsymbol{k}$ at position $n$, attention score $a(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k})$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k}) & =<f(\\boldsymbol{q}, m), f(\\boldsymbol{k}, n)> \\\\\n& =\\sum_{j=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left[\\left(q_{2 j} k_{2 j}+q_{2 j+1} k_{2 j+1}\\right) \\cos (m-n) \\theta_{j}+\\left(q_{2 j} k_{2 j+1}-q_{2 j+1} k_{2 j}\\right) \\sin (m-n) \\theta_{j}\\right] \\\\\n& :=g(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, m-n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, RoPE encodes position information in a relative manner, as the attention score depends on the relative distances between positions rather than their absolute position values.\n```\n\n#### 4. Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Z. Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** EM-LLM is introduced, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency and providing a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/36 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nNeurocomputing, 568:127063, 2024.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Hanna M.

URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1472. ## A PreLIMINARY\n\n## A. 1 RoPE FROM SEQUENCE DOMAIN\n\nTransformer models require the integration of explicit positional information through positional embeddings to effectively discern the order of input sequences (Vaswani et al. 2017). In this work, we direct our attention to the specific instance of positional encoding known as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), as prominently featured in the architecture of the LLaMA model (Touvron et al. 2023a b). Given a query vector $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}=\\left[q_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, q_{t}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $t$ and a key vector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{s}=\\left[k_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, k_{s}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $s$, RoPE first splits $q_{t}, k_{s}$ into pairs on the direction of feature dimensions, with every two dimensions forming a complex number, or a vector in the complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}=\\left[\\tilde{q}_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)}=q_{t}^{(2 n)}+i q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}=\\left[\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)}=k_{s}^{(2 n)}+i k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAfter that, RoPE injects the position information by an element-wise multiplication between the preprocessed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}$ and a list of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$-parameterized rotary vectors in the complex plane. When attention\nis calculated, relative position information $t-s$ is acquired through $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t} \\odot e^{i t \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s} \\odot e^{i s \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} e^{i t \\theta_{n}}\\left(\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)} e^{i s \\theta_{n}}\\right)^{*}\\right]=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left(q_{t}^{(2 n)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}+q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\\right) \\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}+ \\\\\n&\\left.k_{s}^{(2 n)} k^{(2 n+1)}-q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}\\right) \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile RoPE can theoretically convey the relative information at any context length, RoPE still fails to extrapolate practically. It is worth noting that rotary angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in Equation 8 play an important role. In the vanilla design of RoPE, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is defined as Equation 9 . Different angles correspond to different features and that is the starting point of most RoPE-based extrapolation methods (bloc97, 2023b, Rozi\u00e8re et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

[2019], Lan et al. [2020], Clark et al. [2020], Radford et al. [2019], Radford and Narasimhan|[2018]. On the other side, the previous work Parikh et al. [2016], Shaw et al. [[2018], Huang et al. [2018], Dai et al. [2019], Yang et al. [2019], Raffel et al. [2020], Ke et al. [2020], He et al.|[2020], Huang et al. [2020] focuses on relative position encoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these approaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the perspective of Neural ODE [hen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the position information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the proposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better performance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE. In brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\n- We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly built based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information into the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation. - We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired for natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are not compatible with linear self-attention. - We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained language models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer\n\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem in self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2). We then describe the rotary position encoding (RoPE) and study its properties in Section (3) We report experiments in Section (4). Finally, we conclude this paper in Section (5)\n\n## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Preliminary\n\nLet $\\mathbb{S}_{N}=\\left\\{w_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be a sequence of $N$ input tokens with $w_{i}$ being the $i^{t h}$ element. The corresponding word embedding of $\\mathbb{S}_{N}$ is denoted as $\\mathbb{E}_{N}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token $w_{i}$ without position information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms them into queries, keys, and value representations. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =f_{q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =f_{k}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{n} & =f_{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}_{n}$ incorporate the $m^{t h}$ and $n^{t h}$ positions through $f_{q}, f_{k}$ and $f_{v}$, respectively. The query and key values are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\nrepresentation. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{m, n} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{m} & =\\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{m, n} \\boldsymbol{v}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form Equation 11 . ### 2.2 Absolute position embedding\n\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\n\n$$\nf_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, i\\right):=\\boldsymbol{W}_{t: t \\in\\{q, k, v\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}+\\boldsymbol{p}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{p}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/23 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(2024); Rozi\u00e8re et al.

YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) improved NTK-aware scaling by segmenting RoPE features and applying tailored extrapolation strategies, achieving 64 K context length for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 400 finetuning steps. Distinguishingly, our RESONANCE RoPE focus on reducing feature interpolation on OOD positions, which we argue is another important factor in improving the length extrapolation capability of Transformer. ### 2.2 Long Context Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of Transformer-based LLMs' longcontext capabilities are twofold: synthetic task assessments for length extrapolation strategies and real-world task evaluations at the LLM scale. Synthetic evaluations target simple tasks such as long sequence classification (Tay et al., 2021) and arithmetic language modeling (Liu et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). LLM scale evaluations measure metrics such as perplexity (PPL) in extensive\ntext corpora (e.g., PG19 (Rae et al., 2020), GovReport (Huang et al., 2021), GitHub (Wu et al., 2022)) and complex tasks including summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning (An et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2023). ## 3 Background\n\n### 3.1 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)\n\nIn Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), the selfattention scores are softmax-normalized scaled attention logits $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ :\n\n$$\na_{m, n}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSuppose the input to a single attention head is $\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the dimension of an attention head. RoPE injects the position information of each token into the $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$ vectors by the following equations in the complex space:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\theta_{j} & =b^{\\frac{-2 j}{d}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k}$ are trainable parameters, and $b$ is a constant called the rotary base, which is set to 10,000 (Su et al., 2024) or other integers or fractions (Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). This form makes the dot product between the $m$-th query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}$ and $n$-th key $\\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ only depend on the input $\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ and their relative distance $(m-n)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}^{*} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\\right) e^{i(m-n) \\theta_{j}}\\right] \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRoPE's real-number implementation divides the $d$ dimension space into multiple 2-dimensional subspaces and applies real rotation matrix to each of them. Formally, define a $d \\times d$ block-diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{0}, m} & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{1}, m} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}, m}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{0}, \\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}\\right\\}$, and each $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ rotation matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos m \\theta_{j} & -\\sin m \\theta_{j} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{j} & \\cos m \\theta_{j}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nRoPE computes the attention logit $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n-m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor each two dimensions $[2 j: 2 j+1]$ of $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$, its corresponding $\\theta_{j}$ reflects a temporal wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$. This wavelength describes the token length for the corresponding RoPE features to encounter approximately the same rotary angle $m \\theta_{j}$ in Equation 3:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{j}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 j}{d}}\n$$\n\nAs an example, the wavelengths of LLaMA / LLaMA2's RoPE features range from $2 \\pi \\approx 6.28$ for $\\theta_{0}$ to $2 * 10000^{126 / 128} \\pi \\approx 54410.14$ for $\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}$. ### 3.2 Critical Dimensions of RoPE\n\nIn a TSTL scenario (Press et al., 2022), one takes a model trained on texts with lengths up to $L$, and tests it on a task with input lengths up to $L^{\\prime}=s L$, with the scaling factor $s>1$. Recently, Liu et al. (2024) discovered that there may exist two \"critical dimensions\" in RoPE features, which correspond to the dimensions $[2 c: 2 c+1]$ that satisfies $\\lambda_{c} \\geq L$ and $\\lambda_{c-1}<L$. The dimensions of RoPE features above and below the critical dimension (which we denote as \"post-critical dimensions\" and \"pre-critical dimensions\", respectively) have different behaviors in TSTL: for post-critical dimensions (i.e., $j>c$ ), since their wavelengths satisfy $\\lambda_{j}>L$, the training corpus does not cover all possible rotary angles $m \\theta_{j}$ on a unit circle. Thus, these dimensions will encounter OOD value range on longer sequences. This is not an issue for precritical dimensions due to their shorter temporal wavelengths. The concept of RoPE's critical dimensions implicitly guides the development of RoPE scaling methods. For example, previous RoPE scaling methods (Chen et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024) mainly focus on reducing or avoiding value extrapolation on post-critical dimensions, and minimize post-training modifications to the pre-critical dimensions. ### 3.3 Yet another RoPE extensioN (YaRN)\n\nYaRN (Peng et al., 2024) is the current state-of-theart RoPE scaling method for TSTL. It introduces the \"NTK-by-parts\" scaling for RoPE, which applies different scaling strategies to each RoPE feature according to its temporal wavelength. In a TSTL scenario with scaling factor $s$, YaRN scales the wavelength of the $j$-th RoPE feature $\\lambda_{j}$ to $\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}$ and further fine-tune the model:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}=\\left(1-\\gamma_{j}\\right) s \\lambda_{j}+\\gamma_{j} \\lambda_{j}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{j}$ is a piece-wise function depending on its corresponding wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$, and two hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ :\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n1, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}<L / \\beta \\\\\n0, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}>L / \\alpha \\\\\n\\frac{L / \\lambda_{j}-\\alpha}{\\beta-\\alpha}, & \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/23 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nWe introduce RESONANCE ROPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGEN, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying RESONANCE RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications. ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks, showcasing their ability to handle complex interactions, document analyses, professional writing, and advanced reasoning with a unified approach (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Jiang et al., 2024). As these models are increasingly adapted for complex applications, challenges arise in scenarios requiring the comprehension or generation\n\n[^0]of long texts. Specifically, the train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenario (Press et al., 2022) highlights a limitation where LLMs, pre-trained on shorter sequences, struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences, impacting their performance in real-world applications (Zhao et al., 2023). Recent efforts to enhance TSTL performance have focused on LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024), such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), owing to their exceptional capabilities and widespread adoption. These initiatives aim to refine the test-time computation of RoPE position embedding by introducing a scaling factor to either the position index of each token (Chen et al., 2023) or RoPE's base value (Xiong et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2024). These methods ensure that the position embeddings for out-of-distribution (OOD) positions remain within the range experienced during pre-training. This minimizes the need for the model to adapt to new position embedding value ranges, a task that is inherently difficult. In this paper, we introduce RESONANCE RoPE, a novel technique designed to further narrow the generalization gap on position embeddings in TSTL scenarios. Recognizing that RoPE's position embedding is governed by a complex, non-linear function, we posit that minimizing extrapolation on OOD positions, while crucial, is insufficient. We argue that it is equally vital to address the interpolation of RoPE features at the OOD positions. By implementing RESONANCE ROPE, we slightly scale each RoPE feature to correspond to an integer wavelength. This adjustment aligns each RoPE feature's wavelength with a specific token span length, enabling it to \"resonate\" with a particular local context length. This simple modification effectively reduces the generalization gap for over half of the position embedding features in LLaMA\nand LLaMA2 under TSTL scenarios. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with RoPE and any RoPE-based scaling techniques, enhancing their performance in TSTL situations without the need for additional computational resources during training or inference. Additionally, to facilitate further research on position embeddings, we present a new synthetic benchmark tailored for TSTL scenarios, named POSGEN. Improving position embeddings for TSTL requires a detailed analysis of the cause of failures in handling longer contexts. However, current benchmarks, such as those measuring perplexity in long context (Rae et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022) and most synthetic TSTL tasks (Liu et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023) face a common issue: the difficulty of generating the next token increases with context length. This makes it difficult to determine whether a model's failure is due to its inability to generate more complex tokens or its failure to recognize out-of-distribution (OOD) positions. POsGEN addresses this limitation by standardizing the difficulty level of token generation across all positions. This ensures that any observed shortcomings are directly related to the model's inability to identify and handle new token positions effectively. Our contributions in this study are threefold:\n\n1. We propose Resonance RoPE, an innovative modification to RoPE based on an indepth analysis of the wavelengths of RoPE features, aiming to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios across RoPE and similar RoPE-based scaling techniques, without necessitating extra computational resources during runtime.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: rotary positional embedding linear attention, gated linear attention positional encoding, rope integration in linear transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: rotary positional embedding linear attention*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 554  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 2. The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: rotary positional embedding linear attention*\n\n*Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Inkit Padhi, K. Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 114  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 3. The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression\n\n*From Search Query: rotary positional embedding linear attention*\n\n*Vinit Ravishankar, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**TL;DR:** While sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models, because they were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\n\n**Abstract:** In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting, transformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for instance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several modifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used in the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance, separating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying attention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that surprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language models, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then answer why that is: sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps. Higher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher compression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned absolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal embeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding architectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn cross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Stable, Fast and Accurate: Kernelized Attention with Relative Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention positional encoding*\n\n*Shengjie Luo, Shanda Li, Tianle Cai, Di He, Dinglan Peng, Shuxin Zheng, Guolin Ke, Liwei Wang, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and demonstrates that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla Kernelized attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time complexity. Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Relative Positional Encoding for Transformers with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention positional encoding*\n\n*A. Liutkus, Ond\u0159ej C\u00edfka, Shih-Lun Wu, Umut Simsekli, Yi-Hsuan Yang, Ga\u00ebl Richard*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stochastic Positional Encoding is presented as a way to generate PE that can be used as a replacement to the classical additive (sinusoidal) PE and provably behaves like RPE.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in Transformer models allow for unprecedented sequence lengths, due to linear space and time complexity. In the meantime, relative positional encoding (RPE) was proposed as beneficial for classical Transformers and consists in exploiting lags instead of absolute positions for inference. Still, RPE is not available for the recent linear-variants of the Transformer, because it requires the explicit computation of the attention matrix, which is precisely what is avoided by such methods. In this paper, we bridge this gap and present Stochastic Positional Encoding as a way to generate PE that can be used as a replacement to the classical additive (sinusoidal) PE and provably behaves like RPE. The main theoretical contribution is to make a connection between positional encoding and cross-covariance structures of correlated Gaussian processes. We illustrate the performance of our approach on the Long-Range Arena benchmark and on music generation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Encoding Recurrence into Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention positional encoding*\n\n*Feiqing Huang, Kexin Lu, Yuxi Cai, Zhen Qin, Yanwen Fang, Guangjian Tian, Guodong Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent dynamics introduced by the RNN layer can be encapsulated into the positional encodings of a multihead self-attention, and this makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate these recurrent dynamics into a Transformer, leading to a new module, Self-Attention with Recurrence (RSA).\n\n**Abstract:** This paper novelly breaks down with ignorable loss an RNN layer into a sequence of simple RNNs, each of which can be further rewritten into a lightweight positional encoding matrix of a self-attention, named the Recurrence Encoding Matrix (REM). Thus, recurrent dynamics introduced by the RNN layer can be encapsulated into the positional encodings of a multihead self-attention, and this makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate these recurrent dynamics into a Transformer, leading to a new module, Self-Attention with Recurrence (RSA). The proposed module can leverage the recurrent inductive bias of REMs to achieve a better sample efficiency than its corresponding baseline Transformer, while the self-attention is used to model the remaining non-recurrent signals. The relative proportions of these two components are controlled by a data-driven gated mechanism, and the effectiveness of RSA modules are demonstrated by four sequential learning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: rotary positional embedding linear attention*\n\n*Ahmed Murtadha, Yunfeng Liu, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Yu Lu, Jianlin Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1. Linear Attention\n\nLinear Transformer architectures discard the Softmax Attention mechanism, replacing it with distinct approximations (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b;a). The key idea is to\n\n[^1]leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ matrix multiplication.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 5 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"linear attention\" \"rotary positional embedding\" \"numerical stability\", , \"gated linear attention\" RoPE implementation, , \"test-time training\" RoPE integration\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated linear attention\" RoPE implementation*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Block-Recurrent Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated linear attention\" RoPE implementation*\n\n*DeLesley S. Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code. Our code has been released as open source.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 79  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Online GNN Evaluation Under Test-time Graph Distribution Shifts\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" RoPE integration*\n\n*Xin Zheng, Dongjin Song, Qingsong Wen, Bo Du, Shirui Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An effective learning behavior discrepancy score is developed, dubbed LeBeD, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models, which enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation.\n\n**Abstract:** Evaluating the performance of a well-trained GNN model on real-world graphs is a pivotal step for reliable GNN online deployment and serving. Due to a lack of test node labels and unknown potential training-test graph data distribution shifts, conventional model evaluation encounters limitations in calculating performance metrics (e.g., test error) and measuring graph data-level discrepancies, particularly when the training graph used for developing GNNs remains unobserved during test time. In this paper, we study a new research problem, online GNN evaluation, which aims to provide valuable insights into the well-trained GNNs's ability to effectively generalize to real-world unlabeled graphs under the test-time graph distribution shifts. Concretely, we develop an effective learning behavior discrepancy score, dubbed LeBeD, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models. Through a novel GNN re-training strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, the proposed LeBeD comprehensively integrates learning behavior discrepancies from both node prediction and structure reconstruction perspectives. This enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation. Extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse graph distribution shifts could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing its strong correlation with ground-truth test errors on various well-trained GNN models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Cheung*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a test suite of coreference resolution subtasks that require reasoning over multiple facts and introduces subtasks where knowledge is present only at inference time using fictional knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Many state-of-the-art natural language understanding (NLU) models are based on pretrained neural language models. These models often make inferences using information from multiple sources. An important class of such inferences are those that require both background knowledge, presumably contained in a model\u2019s pretrained parameters, and instance-specific information that is supplied at inference time. However, the integration and reasoning abilities of NLU models in the presence of multiple knowledge sources have been largely understudied. In this work, we propose a test suite of coreference resolution subtasks that require reasoning over multiple facts. These subtasks differ in terms of which knowledge sources contain the relevant facts. We also introduce subtasks where knowledge is present only at inference time using fictional knowledge. We evaluate state-of-the-art coreference resolution models on our dataset. Our results indicate that several models struggle to reason on-the-fly over knowledge observed both at pretrain time and at inference time. However, with task-specific training, a subset of models demonstrates the ability to integrate certain knowledge types from multiple sources. Still, even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating knowledge presented only at inference time.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

While various techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement. Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training. This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.

It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between\nelements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate various methods to integrate positional information into the\nlearning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel\nmethod named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the\npositional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute\nposition with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit\nrelative position dependency in self-attention formulation.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated linear attention\" RoPE implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

FTFT: Efficient and Robust Fine-Tuning by Transferring Training Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\" RoPE integration*\n\n*Yupei Du, Albert Gatt, Dong Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the massive success of fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models\n(PLMs), they remain susceptible to out-of-distribution input. Dataset\ncartography is a simple yet effective dual-model approach that improves the\nrobustness of fine-tuned PLMs. It involves fine-tuning a model on the original\ntraining set (i.e. reference model), selecting a subset of important training\ninstances based on the training dynamics, and fine-tuning again only on these\nselected examples (i.e. main model). However, this approach requires\nfine-tuning the same model twice, which is computationally expensive for large\nPLMs. In this paper, we show that (1) training dynamics are highly transferable\nacross model sizes and pre-training methods, and that (2) fine-tuning main\nmodels using these selected training instances achieves higher training\nefficiency than empirical risk minimization (ERM). Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach: Fine-Tuning by\ntransFerring Training dynamics (FTFT). Compared with dataset cartography, FTFT\nuses more efficient reference models and aggressive early stopping.

ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases\n\n*Boxi Cao, Le Sun, Qiao Liang, Xianpei Han, Hongyu Lin, Ziliang Deng, Qiaoyu Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Enabling large language models to utilize real-world tools effectively is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Existing approaches to tool learning have either primarily relied on extremely large language models, such as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or utilized supervised learning to train limited scopes of tools on compact models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can achieve generalized tool-use abilities without tool-specific training. To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework designed to automatically generate a diverse tool-use corpus and learn generalized tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention. Specifically, ToolAlpaca first automatically creates a highly diversified tool-use corpus by building a multi-agent simulation environment. The corpus contains 3938 tool-use instances from more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories. Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize previously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use capabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like GPT-3.5, demonstrating that learning generalized tool-use ability is feasible for compact language models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hallo2: Long-Duration and High-Resolution Audio-Driven Portrait Image Animation\n\n*Jingdong Wang, Siyu Zhu, Hang Zhou, Kaihui Cheng, Hanlin Shang, Hao Zhu, Yao Yao, Hui Li, Jiahao Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in latent diffusion-based generative models for portrait image animation, such as Hallo, have achieved impressive results in short-duration video synthesis. In this paper, we present updates to Hallo, introducing several design enhancements to extend its capabilities. First, we extend the method to produce long-duration videos. To address substantial challenges such as appearance drift and temporal artifacts, we investigate augmentation strategies within the image space of conditional motion frames. Specifically, we introduce a patch-drop technique augmented with Gaussian noise to enhance visual consistency and temporal coherence over long duration. Second, we achieve 4K resolution portrait video generation. To accomplish this, we implement vector quantization of latent codes and apply temporal alignment techniques to maintain coherence across the temporal dimension. By integrating a high-quality decoder, we realize visual synthesis at 4K resolution. Third, we incorporate adjustable semantic textual labels for portrait expressions as conditional inputs. This extends beyond traditional audio cues to improve controllability and increase the diversity of the generated content. To the best of our knowledge, Hallo2, proposed in this paper, is the first method to achieve 4K resolution and generate hour-long, audio-driven portrait image animations enhanced with textual prompts. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on publicly available datasets, including HDTF, CelebV, and our introduced \"Wild\" dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-duration portrait video animation, successfully generating rich and controllable content at 4K resolution for duration extending up to tens of minutes.

Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Suyuchen Wang, I. Kobyzev, Peng Lu, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Resonance RoPE is introduced, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenarios in Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where models pre-trained on shorter sequences face difficulty with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences. We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/23 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(2024); Rozi\u00e8re et al. (2023); Xiong et al. (2023) modify RoPE's rotary base and employ fine-tuning on extended sequences, termed Adjusted Base Frequency (ABF) or \"NTKaware\" scaling. Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023) achieved 16 K context length with this method after 10,000 fine-tuning steps. YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) improved NTK-aware scaling by segmenting RoPE features and applying tailored extrapolation strategies, achieving 64 K context length for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) with 400 finetuning steps. Distinguishingly, our RESONANCE RoPE focus on reducing feature interpolation on OOD positions, which we argue is another important factor in improving the length extrapolation capability of Transformer. ### 2.2 Long Context Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of Transformer-based LLMs' longcontext capabilities are twofold: synthetic task assessments for length extrapolation strategies and real-world task evaluations at the LLM scale. Synthetic evaluations target simple tasks such as long sequence classification (Tay et al., 2021) and arithmetic language modeling (Liu et al., 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). LLM scale evaluations measure metrics such as perplexity (PPL) in extensive\ntext corpora (e.g., PG19 (Rae et al., 2020), GovReport (Huang et al., 2021), GitHub (Wu et al., 2022)) and complex tasks including summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning (An et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2023). ## 3 Background\n\n### 3.1 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)\n\nIn Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), the selfattention scores are softmax-normalized scaled attention logits $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ :\n\n$$\na_{m, n}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSuppose the input to a single attention head is $\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $l$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the dimension of an attention head. RoPE injects the position information of each token into the $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$ vectors by the following equations in the complex space:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]} & =\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} e^{i m \\theta_{j}} \\\\\n\\theta_{j} & =b^{\\frac{-2 j}{d}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k}$ are trainable parameters, and $b$ is a constant called the rotary base, which is set to 10,000 (Su et al., 2024) or other integers or fractions (Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). This form makes the dot product between the $m$-th query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}$ and $n$-th key $\\boldsymbol{k}_{n}$ only depend on the input $\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ and their relative distance $(m-n)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\boldsymbol{q}_{m,[2 j: 2 j+1]}^{*} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n,[2 j: 2 j+1]}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\Re\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\\right) e^{i(m-n) \\theta_{j}}\\right] \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRoPE's real-number implementation divides the $d$ dimension space into multiple 2-dimensional subspaces and applies real rotation matrix to each of them. Formally, define a $d \\times d$ block-diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{0}, m} & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{1}, m} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\cdots & \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}, m}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{0}, \\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}\\right\\}$, and each $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ rotation matrix:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\theta_{j}, m}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos m \\theta_{j} & -\\sin m \\theta_{j} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{j} & \\cos m \\theta_{j}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nRoPE computes the attention logit $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{x}_{m} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{n} & =\\boldsymbol{x}_{m}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}_{q} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n-m}^{d} \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor each two dimensions $[2 j: 2 j+1]$ of $\\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k}$, its corresponding $\\theta_{j}$ reflects a temporal wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$. This wavelength describes the token length for the corresponding RoPE features to encounter approximately the same rotary angle $m \\theta_{j}$ in Equation 3:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{j}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 j}{d}}\n$$\n\nAs an example, the wavelengths of LLaMA / LLaMA2's RoPE features range from $2 \\pi \\approx 6.28$ for $\\theta_{0}$ to $2 * 10000^{126 / 128} \\pi \\approx 54410.14$ for $\\theta_{\\frac{d}{2}-1}$. ### 3.2 Critical Dimensions of RoPE\n\nIn a TSTL scenario (Press et al., 2022), one takes a model trained on texts with lengths up to $L$, and tests it on a task with input lengths up to $L^{\\prime}=s L$, with the scaling factor $s>1$. Recently, Liu et al. (2024) discovered that there may exist two \"critical dimensions\" in RoPE features, which correspond to the dimensions $[2 c: 2 c+1]$ that satisfies $\\lambda_{c} \\geq L$ and $\\lambda_{c-1}<L$. The dimensions of RoPE features above and below the critical dimension (which we denote as \"post-critical dimensions\" and \"pre-critical dimensions\", respectively) have different behaviors in TSTL: for post-critical dimensions (i.e., $j>c$ ), since their wavelengths satisfy $\\lambda_{j}>L$, the training corpus does not cover all possible rotary angles $m \\theta_{j}$ on a unit circle. Thus, these dimensions will encounter OOD value range on longer sequences. This is not an issue for precritical dimensions due to their shorter temporal wavelengths. The concept of RoPE's critical dimensions implicitly guides the development of RoPE scaling methods. For example, previous RoPE scaling methods (Chen et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024) mainly focus on reducing or avoiding value extrapolation on post-critical dimensions, and minimize post-training modifications to the pre-critical dimensions. ### 3.3 Yet another RoPE extensioN (YaRN)\n\nYaRN (Peng et al., 2024) is the current state-of-theart RoPE scaling method for TSTL. It introduces the \"NTK-by-parts\" scaling for RoPE, which applies different scaling strategies to each RoPE feature according to its temporal wavelength. In a TSTL scenario with scaling factor $s$, YaRN scales the wavelength of the $j$-th RoPE feature $\\lambda_{j}$ to $\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}$ and further fine-tune the model:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda_{j}}=\\left(1-\\gamma_{j}\\right) s \\lambda_{j}+\\gamma_{j} \\lambda_{j}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{j}$ is a piece-wise function depending on its corresponding wavelength $\\lambda_{j}$, and two hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ :\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{j}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n1, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}<L / \\beta \\\\\n0, & \\text { if } \\lambda_{j}>L / \\alpha \\\\\n\\frac{L / \\lambda_{j}-\\alpha}{\\beta-\\alpha}, & \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n```\n\n#### 2. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/39 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Hanna M.

URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1472. ## A PreLIMINARY\n\n## A. 1 RoPE FROM SEQUENCE DOMAIN\n\nTransformer models require the integration of explicit positional information through positional embeddings to effectively discern the order of input sequences (Vaswani et al. 2017). In this work, we direct our attention to the specific instance of positional encoding known as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), as prominently featured in the architecture of the LLaMA model (Touvron et al. 2023a b). Given a query vector $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}=\\left[q_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, q_{t}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $t$ and a key vector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{s}=\\left[k_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, k_{s}^{(d-1)}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at position $s$, RoPE first splits $q_{t}, k_{s}$ into pairs on the direction of feature dimensions, with every two dimensions forming a complex number, or a vector in the complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}=\\left[\\tilde{q}_{t}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)}=q_{t}^{(2 n)}+i q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} \\\\\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}=\\left[\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(0)}, \\cdots, \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(d / 2-1)}\\right] & \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)}=k_{s}^{(2 n)}+i k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAfter that, RoPE injects the position information by an element-wise multiplication between the preprocessed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s}$ and a list of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$-parameterized rotary vectors in the complex plane. When attention\nis calculated, relative position information $t-s$ is acquired through $\\cos$ and $\\sin$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{t} \\odot e^{i t \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{s} \\odot e^{i s \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} e^{i t \\theta_{n}}\\left(\\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n)} e^{i s \\theta_{n}}\\right)^{*}\\right]=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left(q_{t}^{(2 n)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}+q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n+1)}\\right) \\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}+ \\\\\n&\\left.k_{s}^{(2 n)} k^{(2 n+1)}-q_{t}^{(2 n+1)} k_{s}^{(2 n)}\\right) \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile RoPE can theoretically convey the relative information at any context length, RoPE still fails to extrapolate practically. It is worth noting that rotary angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in Equation 8 play an important role. In the vanilla design of RoPE, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is defined as Equation 9 . Different angles correspond to different features and that is the starting point of most RoPE-based extrapolation methods (bloc97, 2023b, Rozi\u00e8re et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, even with their remarkable capacity, these LLMs remain restricted by pre-defined context window sizes, suffering from notable performance decline when input tokens exceeds these limits. Nevertheless, numerous application scenarios demand extremely long input sequences, including long document summarization (Huang et al., 2021), in-context learning with numerous examples ( Li et al., 2023), and long document retrieval (Zhou et al., 2022), etc. This naturally poses a significant challenge of context window extension: Extending the context window of a pre-trained LLM to accommodate longer sequences. Naively fine-tuning LLMs on inputs of target length for window extension has received limited success due to the large disruption introduced by new position indices (Chen et al., 2023a; Han et al., 2023). Addressing this, Position Interpolation (Chen et al., 2023a; kaiokendev, 2023; Peng et al., 2023) propose to down-scale the position indices to match the original window size, yielding improved results for context extension. However, these methods still rely on Full-length fine-tuning, i.e., finetuning with context of target length, which is memory and time-intensive due to the computational complexity that increases quadratically with input length. For example, Chen et al. (2023a) use 32 A100 GPUs to extend LLaMA models from 2 k to 8 k context, and 128 A100 GPUs for even larger context. These overhead has made it impossible to extend context window to extreme lengths.

PoSE fine-tuning for extending the context window size from 2,048 to 8,192 . At each iteration, the former directly takes 8,192 tokens for fine-tuning, while PoSE manipulates the position indices of 2,048 tokens to simulate longer inputs. For example, we partition the original context window of 2,048 tokens into two chunks, and adjust the position indices of the second chunk by adding a distinct skipping bias term. These bias terms, as well as the length of each chunk, are altered for each training example, so that the model can adapt to all relative positions of the target context window through fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) fine-tuning to decouple the fine-tuning length from the target context window length, unleashing the possibility of efficiently extending context window to an extreme size. The key idea of PoSE is to simulate long inputs by manipulating position indices within a fixed context window. As depicted in Figure 1, we partition the original context window into several chunks, and adjust the position indices of each chunk by adding a distinct skipping bias term. These bias terms, as well as the length of each chunk, are altered for each training example, so that the model can adapt to all positions (including both absolute and relative) within the target context window through fine-tuning. Meanwhile, by maintaining continuous position indices within each chunk, PoSE bears a close resemblance to pre-training. As a result, the model's pre-trained capacity for language modeling and comprehension is retained to the greatest degree. The advantages of our PoSE are threefold: 1) Memory and Time Efficiency: By only requiring the original context size for fine-tuning, PoSE circumvents the quadratic increase in computational complexity with respect to target length during the fine-tuning stage, thereby significantly reducing memory and time overhead. 2) Potential for Extremely-Long Context: We manage to extend the context window of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) by up to 64 times $(2 \\mathrm{k} \\rightarrow 128 \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{k}=1,024)$ while preserving decent ability of language modeling and understanding. 3) Compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and PI strategies: The effectiveness of PoSE has been empirically validated across several representative RoPE-based LLMs, including LLaMA, LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), GPT-J (Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021), and Baichuan (Baichuan, 2023). Additionally, PoSE has been demonstrated to be compatible with a variety of position interpolation methods, including Linear (Chen et al., 2023a), NTK (Peng \\& Quesnelle, 2023), and YaRN (Peng et al., 2023) interpolation. Notably, by decoupling the fine-tuning and target length, PoSE can theoretically extend context window to an infinite length. The only constraint is the memory usage during the inference phase. Hopefully, with the continuous advancements in efficient inference techniques, including Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), xFormers (Lefaudeux et al., 2022), vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), etc, we believe PoSE can promisingly push the context window size to a even larger scale. ## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nTraining Length-Extrapolatable Models. Length extrapolation requires the model to handle continually increasing input tokens, even beyond the context window size used for training (Press et al., 2021). To this end, a series of positional embedding schemes have been proposed, including ALibi (Press et al., 2021), xPos (Sun et al., 2023), NoPos (Haviv et al., 2022), etc. Similar to our work, Ruoss et al. (2023) also attempted to simulate longer sequences during training time to mitigate out-of-distribution lengths. They proposed randomized positional encoding\n(RandPos), which randomly selected an ordered subset of position indices from longer sequences. Our proposed method, PoSE, diverges from their approach in several key aspects: First, RandPos is a positional embedding scheme designed to pre-train encoder-only models from scratch for length extrapolation. In contrast, PoSE is a fine-tuning method aiming at efficiently extend the context window of pre-trained LLMs, which are majorly decoder-only models. Second, in RandPos, the position indices between adjacent tokens are not continuous. However, in PoSE, the position indices within each chunk are intentionally made continuous to resemble the pre-training phase, therefore reducing the risk of disrupting the language modeling abilities learned during pre-training. Fine-tuning LLMs for Longer Context. Differing from length extrapolation, which primarily involves training a model from scratch to support lengths exceeding those it was initially trained for, context window extension focuses on extending the context window of a pre-trained LLM. Directly fine-tuning an existing LLM with a longer context window has been shown to progress slowly (Chen et al., 2023a). To expedite and stabilize training, Chen et al. (2023a) first down-scaled position indices to match original context size through Linear Position Interpolation. Subsequently, a range of Positional Interpolation (PI) strategies have been introduced, including NTK (Peng \\& Quesnelle, 2023) and YaRN (Peng et al., 2023). More recently, LongLora (Chen et al., 2023b) propose shift short attention to approximate full attention. However, all these methods require Full-length fine-tuning, suffering computational cost that grows with target context size. By contrast, our method managed to decouple train / target length, requiring only the original context size for fine-tuning. Memory Transformers. An alternative strategy for extremely long input sequences involves memory mechanisms. Typically, there are two lines of research for utilizing memory: the recurrencebased approach (Dai et al., 2019; Bulatov et al., 2022) and the retrieval-based approach (Wu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Tworkowski et al., 2023). The former segments long inputs and reuses the hidden states of preceding segments as memory, suffering from information loss and limited capacity for random access. The latter encodes prior sequences as (key, value) pairs and utilizes a memory retriever and reader to extract previously encoded information, primarily limited by the lack of interaction between discrete memory segments. More recently, Mohtashami \\& Jaggi (2023) introduced landmark attention to facilitates random access to any chunk of the input. In contrast, our method achieves full access to the entire input without any modifications to the attention mechanism. ## 3 METHODOLOGY\n\n### 3.1 PRELIMINARIES\n\nRotary Position Embedding (RoPE). The use of RoPE (Su et al., 2021) has become pervasive in contemporary LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), GPT-J (Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021), etc. It encodes position information of tokens with a rotation matrix that naturally incorporates explicit relative position dependency. To elucidate, given a hidden vector $\\boldsymbol{h}=\\left[h_{0}, h_{1}, \\ldots, h_{d-1}\\right]$, where $d$ is the hidden dimension, and a position index $m$, RoPE operates as follows:\n\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{h}, m)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nh_{0} \\\\\nh_{1} \\\\\nh_{2} \\\\\nh_{3} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nh_{d-2} \\\\\nh_{d-1}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\cos m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{d / 2-1} \\\\\n\\cos m \\theta_{d / 2-1}\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n-h_{1} \\\\\nh_{0} \\\\\n-h_{3} \\\\\nh_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n-h_{d-1} \\\\\nh_{d-2}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\sin m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{0} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{d / 2-1} \\\\\n\\sin m \\theta_{d / 2-1}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta_{j}=10000^{-2 j / d}, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d / 2-1\\}$. Unlike previous absolute position encodings that are directly applied to the input vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, RoPE is employed on the query and key vectors at each layer. Given a query $\\boldsymbol{q}$ at position $m$ and a key $\\boldsymbol{k}$ at position $n$, attention score $a(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k})$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k}) & =<f(\\boldsymbol{q}, m), f(\\boldsymbol{k}, n)> \\\\\n& =\\sum_{j=0}^{d / 2-1}\\left[\\left(q_{2 j} k_{2 j}+q_{2 j+1} k_{2 j+1}\\right) \\cos (m-n) \\theta_{j}+\\left(q_{2 j} k_{2 j+1}-q_{2 j+1} k_{2 j}\\right) \\sin (m-n) \\theta_{j}\\right] \\\\\n& :=g(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, m-n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, RoPE encodes position information in a relative manner, as the attention score depends on the relative distances between positions rather than their absolute position values.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 7 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"interaction\", , \"RoPE\" \"gating mechanisms\" \"linear attention\", , \"Numerical stability\" \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"long sequences\", , \"Hardware-efficient\" \"RoPE integration\" \"linear attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we confirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 4. The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical stability\" \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Inkit Padhi, K. Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 114  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. CAPE: Encoding Relative Positions with Continuous Augmented Positional Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical stability\" \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Tatiana Likhomanenko, Qiantong Xu, R. Collobert, Gabriel Synnaeve, A. Rogozhnikov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute and relative positions and leads to better generalization performance as well as increased stability with respect to training hyper-parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Without positional information, attention-based Transformer neural networks are permutation-invariant. Absolute or relative positional embeddings are the most popular ways to feed Transformer models with positional information. Absolute positional embeddings are simple to implement, but suffer from generalization issues when evaluating on sequences longer than seen at training time. Relative positions are more robust to input length change, but are more complex to implement and yield inferior model throughput due to extra computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute (simplicity and speed) and relative positional embeddings (better generalization). In addition, our empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art models in machine translation, image and speech recognition demonstrates that CAPE leads to better generalization performance as well as increased stability with respect to training hyper-parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 6.

However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hardware-efficient\" \"RoPE integration\" \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 8.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"interaction\"*\n\n*Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, Yunfeng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer\narchitecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between\nelements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate various methods to integrate positional information into the\nlearning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel\nmethod named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the\npositional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute\nposition with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit\nrelative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE\nenables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length,\ndecaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the\ncapability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position\nencoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental\nresults.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE\" \"gating mechanisms\" \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Round and Round We Go! What makes Rotary Positional Encodings useful?\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE\" \"gating mechanisms\" \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Federico Barbero, Alex Vitvitskyi, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107*\n\n**Abstract:** Positional Encodings (PEs) are a critical component of Transformer-based\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), providing the attention mechanism with important\nsequence-position information. One of the most popular types of encoding used\ntoday in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries\nand keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is\nuseful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance\nincreases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason.\nWe study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is\nbeing used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to\nconstruct robust \"positional\" attention patterns by exploiting the highest\nfrequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the\nlowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic\ninformation. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct\nexperiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes\nsome highlighted issues and improves performance. We believe that this work\nrepresents an interesting step in better understanding PEs in LLMs, which we\nbelieve holds crucial value for scaling LLMs to large sizes and context\nlengths.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7. 3D-RPE: Enhancing Long-Context Modeling Through 3D Rotary Position\n  Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Numerical stability\" \"Rotary Positional Embedding\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Xindian Ma, Wenyuan Liu, Peng Zhang, Nan Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Inspired by the Bloch Sphere representation, we propose a novel rotary\nposition encoding on a three-dimensional sphere, named 3D Rotary Position\nEncoding (3D-RPE). 3D-RPE is an advanced version of the widely used 2D Rotary\nPosition Encoding (RoPE), with two major advantages for modeling long contexts:\ncontrollable long-term decay and improved position resolution. For controllable\nlong-term decay, 3D-RPE allows for the regulation of long-term decay within the\nchunk size, ensuring the modeling of relative positional information between\ntokens at a distant relative position. For enhanced position resolution, 3D-RPE\ncan mitigate the degradation of position resolution caused by position\ninterpolation on RoPE.

ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases\n\n*Boxi Cao, Le Sun, Qiao Liang, Xianpei Han, Hongyu Lin, Ziliang Deng, Qiaoyu Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Enabling large language models to utilize real-world tools effectively is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Existing approaches to tool learning have either primarily relied on extremely large language models, such as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or utilized supervised learning to train limited scopes of tools on compact models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can achieve generalized tool-use abilities without tool-specific training. To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework designed to automatically generate a diverse tool-use corpus and learn generalized tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention. Specifically, ToolAlpaca first automatically creates a highly diversified tool-use corpus by building a multi-agent simulation environment. The corpus contains 3938 tool-use instances from more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories. Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize previously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use capabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like GPT-3.5, demonstrating that learning generalized tool-use ability is feasible for compact language models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hallo2: Long-Duration and High-Resolution Audio-Driven Portrait Image Animation\n\n*Jingdong Wang, Siyu Zhu, Hang Zhou, Kaihui Cheng, Hanlin Shang, Hao Zhu, Yao Yao, Hui Li, Jiahao Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in latent diffusion-based generative models for portrait image animation, such as Hallo, have achieved impressive results in short-duration video synthesis. In this paper, we present updates to Hallo, introducing several design enhancements to extend its capabilities. First, we extend the method to produce long-duration videos. To address substantial challenges such as appearance drift and temporal artifacts, we investigate augmentation strategies within the image space of conditional motion frames. Specifically, we introduce a patch-drop technique augmented with Gaussian noise to enhance visual consistency and temporal coherence over long duration. Second, we achieve 4K resolution portrait video generation. To accomplish this, we implement vector quantization of latent codes and apply temporal alignment techniques to maintain coherence across the temporal dimension. By integrating a high-quality decoder, we realize visual synthesis at 4K resolution. Third, we incorporate adjustable semantic textual labels for portrait expressions as conditional inputs. This extends beyond traditional audio cues to improve controllability and increase the diversity of the generated content. To the best of our knowledge, Hallo2, proposed in this paper, is the first method to achieve 4K resolution and generate hour-long, audio-driven portrait image animations enhanced with textual prompts. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on publicly available datasets, including HDTF, CelebV, and our introduced \"Wild\" dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-duration portrait video animation, successfully generating rich and controllable content at 4K resolution for duration extending up to tens of minutes.
