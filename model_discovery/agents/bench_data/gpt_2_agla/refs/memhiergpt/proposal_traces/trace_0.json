Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg.

We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently.

One compelling feature of Transformers is their ability to handle long contexts given as part of the input. This is particularly visible in tasks where the output depends on parts of the context that may not be\n\n[^0]close-by in the generated sequence, like in summarization, where the summary may need to refer to information scattered across the context, or in largescale image generation, where pixels belonging to the same object may be far apart in the generation order. Transformers excel at such tasks thanks to self-attention, and they are used with longer and longer contexts. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_71b80301f7da51238d79g-01.jpg?height=498&width=695&top_left_y=1162&top_left_x=1063)\n\nFigure 1: Bits-per-character vs. training cost for baseline (orange) and hierarchical Transformers (green). We observe significant perplexity improvements on enwik8 over the vanilla Transformer-XL baseline, see text for details. The ability of Transformers to handle long contexts comes at a price: each self-attention layer, at least in its original form, has complexity quadratic in the length of the context. When a stack of $n$ Transformer layers is used, both memory and time complexity is equal to $O\\left(L^{2} n\\right)$ where $L$ is a sequence length and $n$ number of decoder blocks. Due to this limitation, vanilla transformers are infeasible to train on tasks with very long input sequences, for instance, on high-resolution images. This issue has been studied extensively, and a number of techniques were introduced that modify attention mechanism without changing overall transformer architecture (Child et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021). These sparse attention mechanisms reduce the complexity of self-attention\nbut still force the model to operate on the sequence of the same length as the input. For generative Transformer models, operating at the original scale of the input sequence is necessary, at least in the early and final layers, as the input must be processed at first and generated at the end (Section 4.3). But forcing the models to operate at this granularity throughout the layer stack has both fundamental and practical shortcomings:\n\n- Fundamentally, we aim for the models to create high-level representations of words, entities, or even whole events - which occur at a very different granularity than single letters that the model receives on input. - On the practical side, even layers with linear complexity can be slow and memory-intensive when processing very long sequences. To alleviate these issues, we propose to change the Transformer architecture to first shorten the internal sequence of activations when going deeper in the layer stack and then expand it back before generation. We merge tokens into groups using a shortening operation (Section 2.1) and so reduce the overall sequence length, and then up-sample them again combining with the sequence from earlier layers (Section 2.3), The first part is analogous to the Funnel-Transformer architecture (Dai et al., 2020), and the whole architecture takes inspiration from U-Nets (Ronneberger et al., 2015). In contrast to both these architectures, the model we present is autoregressive, which is harder to ensure in hierarchical models than in vanilla Transformers. The resulting model - which we call Hourglass is an autoregressive Transformer language model that operates on shortened sequences. It yields significant performance improvements for different attention types (Fig. 6,7). We tested Hourglass with Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) blocks on enwik8 dataset. In both cases, it is not only better in terms of perplexity, but it is faster and uses less memory during training. We also propose a regularization technique for hierarchical Transformers called shorten factor dropout which improves perplexity upon baselines trained with fixed shorten factor (see Section 4.1). Finally, Hourglass achieves the new stateof-the-art among Transformer models for image generation of ImageNet32 (see Tab. 3). ## 2 Model\n\nStandard self-attention mechanism uses full tokenlevel sequence representations. In the Hourglass, we bring efficiency to the model by utilizing shortening, which allows us to use the Transformer layers on inputs with significantly smaller lengths. A high-level overview of our proposed model architecture is shown in figures 2 and 3. Attention type in the vanilla layers and shortened layers is a configurable parameter. By default we use relative attention defined in Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019). Any attention module can be used - we show significant efficiency gains when applying Hourglass also for LSH (Kitaev et al., 2020) attention (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 7). ### 2.1 Methods of shortening the input sequence\n\nShortening can be defined as any function $S$ that accepts a tensor $x$ of shape $(l, d)$ and returns a tensor $x^{\\prime}$ of shape $\\left(\\frac{l}{k}, d\\right)$, where $k$ is a hyperparameter called shorten factor. A simple shortening method is 1D average pooling with stride $k$ and pool size $k$, applied along the sequence dimension $l$. Another way of shortening is what we will further call linear pooling ( $l$ and $d$ denote sequence length and $\\left.d_{\\text {model }}\\right)$ :\n\n```\nAlgorithm 2 LinearPooling\n    \\(x^{\\prime} \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Reshape}\\left(x,\\left(\\frac{l}{k}, k \\cdot d\\right)\\right)\\)\n    \\(x^{\\prime} \\leftarrow\\) Linear Projection \\(\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\)\n```\n\nShortening can be also performed by attention, as was introduced in (Dai et al., 2020): $x^{\\prime}=S(x)+$ $\\operatorname{Attention}(Q=S(x), K=V=x$ ) where $S$ is shortening function, originally $S=A v g P o o l$. Directly after this attention operation, a positionwise feed-forward with a residual is performed, so that these two layers form a Transformer block (Vaswani et al., 2017).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/25 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\n# Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models \n\nPiotr Nawrot ${ }^{* 1}$, Szymon Tworkowski ${ }^{* 1}$, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski ${ }^{1}$, Lukasz Kaiser ${ }^{2}$,<br>Yuhuai Wu ${ }^{3}$, Christian Szegedy ${ }^{3}$, Henryk Michalewski ${ }^{3}$<br>${ }^{1}$ University of Warsaw, ${ }^{2}$ OpenAI, ${ }^{3}$ Google Research<br>\\{p.nawrot99, szy.tworkowski, michal.tyrolski, lukaszkaiser\\}@gmail.com,<br>\\{yuhuai, szegedy, henrykm\\}@google.com\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Using this unified framework, we compare several S-FFN architectures for language modeling and provide insights into their relative efficacy and efficiency.

XDoc: Unified Pre-training for Cross-Format Document Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Jingye Chen, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Changrong Zhang, Furu Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** XDoc is proposed, a unified pre-trained model which deals with different document formats in a single model, which is cost effective for real-world deployment and shares backbone parameters for different formats such as the word embedding layer and the Transformer layers.\n\n**Abstract:** The surge of pre-training has witnessed the rapid development of document understanding recently. Pre-training and fine-tuning framework has been effectively used to tackle texts in various formats, including plain texts, document texts, and web texts. Despite achieving promising performance, existing pre-trained models usually target one specific document format at one time, making it difficult to combine knowledge from multiple document formats. To address this, we propose XDoc, a unified pre-trained model which deals with different document formats in a single model. For parameter efficiency, we share backbone parameters for different formats such as the word embedding layer and the Transformer layers. Meanwhile, we introduce adaptive layers with lightweight parameters to enhance the distinction across different formats. Experimental results have demonstrated that with only 36.7% parameters, XDoc achieves comparable or even better performance on a variety of downstream tasks compared with the individual pre-trained models, which is cost effective for real-world deployment.

Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Yanzhe Zhang, Xuezhi Wang, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules with pseudo experience replay can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

Hoi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes VD-BERT, a simple yet effective framework of unified vision-dialog Transformer that leverages the pretrained BERT language models for Visual Dialog tasks, and adapt BERT for the effective fusion of vision and dialog contents via visually grounded training.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, where a dialog agent needs to answer a series of questions through reasoning on the image content and dialog history. Prior work has mostly focused on various attention mechanisms to model such intricate interactions. By contrast, in this work, we propose VD-BERT, a simple yet effective framework of unified vision-dialog Transformer that leverages the pretrained BERT language models for Visual Dialog tasks. The model is unified in that (1) it captures all the interactions between the image and the multi-turn dialog using a single-stream Transformer encoder, and (2) it supports both answer ranking and answer generation seamlessly through the same architecture. More crucially, we adapt BERT for the effective fusion of vision and dialog contents via visually grounded training. Without the need of pretraining on external vision-language data, our model yields new state of the art, achieving the top position in both single-model and ensemble settings (74.54 and 75.35 NDCG scores) on the visual dialog leaderboard.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 96  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. A System for Morphology-Task Generalization via Unified Representation and Behavior Distillation\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Hiroki Furuta, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo, S. Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores a method for learning a single policy that manipulates various forms of agents to solve various tasks by distilling a large amount of proficient behavioral data and suggests large diverse offline datasets, unified IO representation, and policy representation and architecture selection through supervised learning form a promising approach for studying and advancing morphology-task generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** The rise of generalist large-scale models in natural language and vision has made us expect that a massive data-driven approach could achieve broader generalization in other domains such as continuous control. In this work, we explore a method for learning a single policy that manipulates various forms of agents to solve various tasks by distilling a large amount of proficient behavioral data. In order to align input-output (IO) interface among multiple tasks and diverse agent morphologies while preserving essential 3D geometric relations, we introduce morphology-task graph, which treats observations, actions and goals/task in a unified graph representation. We also develop MxT-Bench for fast large-scale behavior generation, which supports procedural generation of diverse morphology-task combinations with a minimal blueprint and hardware-accelerated simulator. Through efficient representation and architecture selection on MxT-Bench, we find out that a morphology-task graph representation coupled with Transformer architecture improves the multi-task performances compared to other baselines including recent discrete tokenization, and provides better prior knowledge for zero-shot transfer or sample efficiency in downstream multi-task imitation learning. Our work suggests large diverse offline datasets, unified IO representation, and policy representation and architecture selection through supervised learning form a promising approach for studying and advancing morphology-task generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. You Need Multiple Exiting: Dynamic Early Exiting for Accelerating Unified Vision Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Dongkuan Xu, Yi Liang, Yanzhi Wang, Caiwen Ding, Yao Li, Tianchi Zhang, Zhenglun Kong, Yaqing Wang, Shengkun Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale Transformer models bring significant improvements for various downstream vision language tasks with a unified architecture. The performance improvements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed and increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from the full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same amount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource waste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively allocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference efficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output confidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur the decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot apply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and decoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is suboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in encoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting strategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the layers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise similarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \\textbf{MuE}. By decomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and can skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference efficiency while minimizing performance drop. Experiments on the SNLI-VE and MS COCO datasets show that the proposed approach MuE can reduce expected inference time by up to 50\\% and 40\\% while maintaining 99\\% and 96\\% performance respectively.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. ProRes: Exploring Degradation-aware Visual Prompt for Universal Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Lefei Zhang, Xinggang Wang, Qian Zhang, Guoli Wang, Tianheng Cheng, Jiaqi Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Image restoration aims to reconstruct degraded images, e.g., denoising or deblurring. Existing works focus on designing task-specific methods and there are inadequate attempts at universal methods. However, simply unifying multiple tasks into one universal architecture suffers from uncontrollable and undesired predictions. To address those issues, we explore prompt learning in universal architectures for image restoration tasks. In this paper, we present Degradation-aware Visual Prompts, which encode various types of image degradation, e.g., noise and blur, into unified visual prompts. These degradation-aware prompts provide control over image processing and allow weighted combinations for customized image restoration. We then leverage degradation-aware visual prompts to establish a controllable and universal model for image restoration, called ProRes, which is applicable to an extensive range of image restoration tasks. ProRes leverages the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) without any task-specific designs. Furthermore, the pre-trained ProRes can easily adapt to new tasks through efficient prompt tuning with only a few images. Without bells and whistles, ProRes achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods and experiments can demonstrate its ability for controllable restoration and adaptation for new tasks. The code and models will be released in \\url{https://github.com/leonmakise/ProRes}.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. UniNet: Unified Architecture Search with Convolution, Transformer, and MLP\n\n*From Search Query: unified adaptive architectures transformer efficiency*\n\n*Hongsheng Li, Yu Liu, Guanglu Song, Xin Huang, Jihao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, transformer and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks. However, how to effectively combine those operators to form high-performance hybrid visual architectures still remains a challenge. In this work, we study the learnable combination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified architecture search approach. Our approach contains two key designs to achieve the search for high-performance networks. First, we model the very different searchable operators in a unified form, and thus enable the operators to be characterized with the same set of configuration parameters. In this way, the overall search space size is significantly reduced, and the total search cost becomes affordable. Second, we propose context-aware downsampling modules (DSMs) to mitigate the gap between the different types of operators. Our proposed DSMs are able to better adapt features from different types of operators, which is important for identifying high-performance hybrid architectures. Finally, we integrate configurable operators and DSMs into a unified search space and search with a Reinforcement Learning-based search algorithm to fully explore the optimal combination of the operators. To this end, we search a baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, named UniNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets and Transformers. In particular, our UniNet-B5 achieves 84.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming EfficientNet-B7 and BoTNet-T7 with 44% and 55% fewer FLOPs respectively. By pretraining on the ImageNet-21K, our UniNet-B6 achieves 87.4%, outperforming Swin-L with 51% fewer FLOPs and 41% fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Sense-X/UniNet.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on combining hierarchical processing with adaptive mechanisms while reducing computational overhead, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n### Token-Parameter Attention Layer\nThe concept of treating model parameters as tokens and using a token-parameter attention layer, as introduced in the \"Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters\" paper, offers a flexible and scalable architecture. This approach allows for progressive and efficient scaling without the need for retraining from scratch, which can significantly reduce computational costs. By decoupling the number of parameter tokens from the input and output channel dimensions, this method enables dynamic interactions between input data and a variable number of parameters, enhancing scalability and efficiency.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nThe \"hieranorm_attngpt\" design emphasizes hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention. This can be combined with linear attention mechanisms to reduce computational overhead. Hierarchical attention can be structured to focus on different scales or aspects of the input data, similar to how hierarchical normalization is used in the \"hiergpt\" design. This hierarchical approach can help in capturing both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Dynamic Resource Allocation\nThe \"Adaptive Computation with Elastic-Response Transformer\" paper introduces dynamic allocation of computational resources based on input complexity. This approach can reduce overall computation by up to 45% while maintaining performance. By adapting the computational resources dynamically, the model can optimize its efficiency based on the complexity of the input, which is a key aspect of reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Efficient Memory Management and Computational Overhead Reduction\n\n### PagedAttention\nThe \"Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\" paper presents a method that organizes attention memory in a hierarchical manner. This approach reduces memory fragmentation and improves memory utilization by up to 38%. Implementing such hierarchical memory management can help in balancing memory and computation overheads in transformer models.\n\n### Sub-Quadratic Complexity\nThe \"Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture\" paper discusses structured state space models combined with hierarchical mixing, achieving linear complexity while maintaining model quality. This approach can be integrated into transformer architectures to reduce the quadratic time and memory complexity associated with the attention mechanism, a significant bottleneck in traditional transformers.\n\n## Unified Adaptive Architectures\n\n### Decoupling Visual Encoding\nAlthough the \"Janus\" model is focused on multimodal tasks, the concept of decoupling different encoding pathways can be applied to autoregressive language models as well. By decoupling different components (e.g., normalization and attention) into separate pathways while using a unified transformer architecture, the model can alleviate conflicts between different tasks or components and enhance flexibility. This decoupling can allow for independent adaptation strategies for different components, improving overall efficiency and performance.\n\n## Key Insights and Implementation\n\n- **Balanced Design**: Combine hierarchical normalization from \"hiergpt\" with hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention from \"hieranorm_attngpt\" to create a balanced design that optimizes both memory and computational overhead.\n- **Unified Adaptation**: Integrate dynamic resource allocation and adaptive parameter initialization to unify adaptation strategies across different components of the model.\n- **Efficiency Techniques**: Implement sub-quadratic complexity methods and hierarchical memory management to reduce computational overhead and improve efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop a more efficient, adaptive, and scalable autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical processing and dynamic resource allocation to minimize computational overhead.\n",

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 3.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Tailoring Self-Attention for Graph via Rooted Subtrees\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical processing*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yunchong Song, Jiayue Zhou, Zhouhan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel multi-hop graph attention mechanism, named Subtree Attention (STA), is proposed, which seamlessly bridges the fully-attentional structure and the rooted subtree, with theoretical proof that STA approximates the global attention under extreme settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have made significant strides in graph learning, yet they still exhibit notable limitations: local attention faces challenges in capturing long-range information due to the inherent problems of the message-passing scheme, while global attention cannot reflect the hierarchical neighborhood structure and fails to capture fine-grained local information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop graph attention mechanism, named Subtree Attention (STA), to address the aforementioned issues. STA seamlessly bridges the fully-attentional structure and the rooted subtree, with theoretical proof that STA approximates the global attention under extreme settings. By allowing direct computation of attention weights among multi-hop neighbors, STA mitigates the inherent problems in existing graph attention mechanisms. Further we devise an efficient form for STA by employing kernelized softmax, which yields a linear time complexity.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical processing*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Pit One Against Many: Leveraging Attention-head Embeddings for Parameter-efficient Multi-head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical processing*\n\n*Huiyin Xue, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head, and empirically demonstrates that this MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling pre-trained language models has resulted in large performance gains in various natural language processing tasks but comes with a large cost in memory requirements. Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Mostafa Mousavi*\n\n**Abstract:** Earthquake signal detection and seismic phase picking are challenging tasks in the processing of noisy data and the monitoring of microearthquakes. Here we present a global deep-learning model for simultaneous earthquake detection and phase picking. Performing these two related tasks in tandem improves model performance in each individual task by combining information in phases and in the full waveform of earthquake signals by using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We show that our model outperforms previous deep-learning and traditional phase-picking and detection algorithms. Applying our model to 5 weeks of continuous data recorded during 2000 Tottori earthquakes in Japan, we were able to detect and locate two times more earthquakes using only a portion (less than 1/3) of seismic stations. Our model picks P and S phases with precision close to manual picks by human analysts; however, its high efficiency and higher sensitivity can result in detecting and characterizing more and smaller events.\n\n**Proceeding:** nature-communications-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. SA-Det3D: Self-Attention Based Context-Aware 3D Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical processing*\n\n*Krzysztof Czarnecki, Chengjie Huang, Prarthana Bhattacharyya*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing point-cloud based 3D object detectors use convolution-like operators to process information in a local neighbourhood with fixed-weight kernels and aggregate global context hierarchically. However, non-local neural networks and self-attention for 2D vision have shown that explicitly modeling long-range interactions can lead to more robust and competitive models. In this paper, we propose two variants of self-attention for contextual modeling in 3D object detection by augmenting convolutional features with self-attention features. We first incorporate the pairwise self-attention mechanism into the current state-of-the-art BEV, voxel and point-based detectors and show consistent improvement over strong baseline models of up to 1.5 3D AP while simultaneously reducing their parameter footprint and computational cost by 15-80% and 30-50%, respectively, on the KITTI validation set. We next propose a self-attention variant that samples a subset of the most representative features by learning deformations over randomly sampled locations. This not only allows us to scale explicit global contextual modeling to larger point-clouds, but also leads to more discriminative and informative feature descriptors. Our method can be flexibly applied to most state-of-the-art detectors with increased accuracy and parameter and compute efficiency. We show our proposed method improves 3D object detection performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets.

Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical processing*\n\n*Tieniu Tan, Ran He, Jie Cao, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Huaibo Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has achieved impressive performance for many vision tasks. However, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for shallow layers. Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus utilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A challenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context modeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of image primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into vision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful tessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in self-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose a simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the first samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning, the second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back to the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into multiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention, leading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we develop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate its strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any extra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with less than 100M parameters. It also achieves 53.9 box AP and 46.8 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 51.9 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task. Code is released at https://github.com/hhb072/STViT.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient attention mechanisms and hierarchical processing, here are some key techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Probabilistic Attention\nThe probabilistic attention mechanism, as seen in the Informer model, significantly reduces the time and memory complexity of attention calculations. This method selects a subset of queries based on a sparsity measurement, which approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the attention scores. This approach reduces the computational overhead but may come at the cost of some information loss. However, it can be optimized with residual connections and complex architectures.\n\n### Local Attention Mechanism\nThe Local Attention Mechanism (LAM) is designed for efficient processing of long sequences, such as time series data. LAM exploits local patterns in the data, reducing the need for global attention and thus lowering computational costs. This mechanism can be particularly useful for models that need to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Sparse or Linear Attention Variants\nUtilizing sparse or linear attention variants can ensure scalability to longer sequences and larger model sizes. These variants, such as those mentioned in the context of Hierarchical Transformer-Gated Networks, can efficiently manage attention computations without the full quadratic complexity of traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\nHierarchical Transformers, as discussed in \"Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient,\" introduce an explicit hierarchical architecture that efficiently handles long sequences. This architecture can be combined with other efficiency mechanisms to balance compression and expressiveness. The Hourglass model, for example, improves upon the Transformer baseline by processing sequences at multiple scales.\n\n### Hierarchical Feature Encoders\nThe HiTime model proposes a hierarchical feature encoder that captures diverse aspects of time series data using both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. This dual embedding strategy ensures that the model retains essential temporal patterns while being adaptable to specific tasks. This hierarchical encoding can be adapted for text data as well, enhancing the model's ability to process complex and long-range dependencies.\n\n### Dynamic Composition of Attention Heads\nThe Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA) transforms attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way, increasing the expressive power of the model. This dynamic composition can be integrated into a hierarchical architecture to adapt attention mechanisms based on the input, potentially improving efficiency and performance.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-offs and Dynamic Resource Allocation\n\n### PagedAttention\nFor efficient memory management, the PagedAttention mechanism can be employed. This approach involves dividing the attention computation into smaller, manageable chunks, reducing memory usage while maintaining computational efficiency. This is particularly useful for serving large language models.\n\n### Temporal Latent Bottleneck\nThe Temporal Latent Bottleneck model divides computation into two streams: a slow, recurrent stream for learning specialized and compressed representations, and a fast stream parameterized as a Transformer. This approach can be adapted to dynamically allocate resources between different processing streams, optimizing both memory and computation.\n\n## Combining Hierarchical Processing and Efficient Attention\n\n### Unified Hierarchical Processing\nCombining hierarchical normalization with hierarchical attention, as suggested in the analysis summary, can create a unified hierarchical processing framework. This integration can leverage the strengths of both hierarchical normalization and attention mechanisms, enhancing the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently while maintaining expressiveness.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling complex and long-range dependencies in data.\n",

By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.

Several works have explored memoryefficient techniques to address the memory limitations of Transformers and enable their application to longer input sequences. One line of research focuses on various approximation techniques or compressing along the sequence dimension [see e.g. 24, 12, 14, 4, 42, 54, 36, 25]. Other works explored replacing attention [19, 20, 41, 23, 3, 57, 40, 53]. Another line of work explores partitioning the large hidden dimension of the feedforward network into parts and retrieving only one part per token [30, 48, 17, 26, 58, 60]. Additionally, extending the context by attending over states from previous sequences has been explored [13, 44], as well as combining local and global contexts [21, 11]. For a comprehensive review of these techniques, we recommend referring to the surveys by Tay et al. [51], Narang et al. [38], Tay et al. [50]. Several studies explored sharding large model on distributed devices tensor, data, or sequence parallelism [49, 16, 55, 27, 59, 31, 46]. Ours shares similarities with the sequence parallelism [27] where sequences are distributed across devices, in contrast, ours implements blockwise computation on sequences for each device. This creates an orthogonal relationship between our method and sequence parallelism, allowing for straightforward combination. In addition, our methodology is compatible with both tensor and data parallelism. Another direction\ninvolves computing exact self-attention in a blockwise manner using the tiling technique [37]. This approach has led to the development of memory efficient attention mechanisms [14,42]. In line with these advancements, our work falls into this category. We propose computing both the feedforward network and self-attention in a blockwise manner, resulting in a significant reduction in memory requirements. ## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we propose a blockwise parallelization approach to reduce the memory requirements of Transformers, the backbone of state-of-the-art NLP models. Our approach enables processing longer input sequences while maintaining or improving performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving up to 4 x memory reduction than memory-efficient Transformers. Our contributions include a practical method for large context sizes in large Transformer models. With the increasing capability of hardware, larger models and longer context length are widely used in AI research. At the same time, as we are pushing up against physics and fabrication limits, it is more important to design scaling approaches as efficient as possible to scale up large models and large context size. Our approach holds promise for training and evaluating complex models with longer input sequences, potentially driving new breakthroughs in machine learning research. Limitations and Future Work. Although our method achieves state-of-the-art low memory usage for Transformer models, it does have some limitations that need to be addressed:\n\n- Optimal performance. While our implementation prioritizes simplicity with high-level Jax operations, optimizing low-level operations is crucial for achieving optimal performance. In future work, we suggest considering porting our method to CUDA and OpenAI Triton to achieve minimal memory cost and maximum speedup. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is supported in part by ONR under N00014-21-1-2769.

However, typically the retriever is not trained jointly as a native component of the LM, but added post-hoc to an already-pretrained LM, which limits the ability of the LM and the retriever to adapt to one another. In this work, we propose the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), an architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch and apply it to the task of modeling long texts. Given a recently generated text chunk in a long document, the LM computes query representations, which are then used to retrieve earlier chunks in the document, located potentially tens of thousands of tokens before. Information from retrieved chunks is fused into the LM representations to predict the next target chunk. We train the retriever component with a semantic objective, where the goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of the next chunk, according to a reference LM. We evaluate RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks, spanning books, code, and mathematical writing, and demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality and subsequently perplexity across the board compared to strong baselines.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/34 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nYuhuai Wu, Markus Norman Rabe, DeLesley Hutchins, and Christian Szegedy. 2022.

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 4. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Multi-armed bandits for resource efficient, online optimization of language model pre-training: the use case of dynamic masking\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic resource allocation transformer memory optimization*\n\n*I\u00f1igo Urteaga, Moulay Draidia, Tomer Lancewicki, Shahram Khadivi*\n\n**TL;DR:** GP-TS provides an interactive framework for efficient and optimized TLM pre-training that, by circumventing costly hyperparameter selection, enables substantial computational savings.\n\n**Abstract:** We design and evaluate a Bayesian optimization framework for resource efficient pre-training of Transformer-based language models (TLMs). TLM pre-training requires high computational resources and introduces many unresolved design choices, such as selecting its pre-training hyperparameters. We propose a multi-armed bandit framework for the sequential selection of TLM pre-training hyperparameters, aimed at optimizing language model performance, in a resource efficient manner. We design a Thompson sampling algorithm, with a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the Masked Language Model (MLM) pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. Instead of MLM pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, the proposed Gaussian process-based Thompson sampling (GP-TS) accelerates pre-training by sequentially selecting masking hyperparameters that improve performance. We empirically demonstrate how GP-TS pre-trains language models efficiently, i.e., it achieves lower MLM loss in fewer epochs, across a variety of settings. In addition, GP-TS pre-trained TLMs attain competitive downstream performance, while avoiding expensive hyperparameter grid search. GP-TS provides an interactive framework for efficient and optimized TLM pre-training that, by circumventing costly hyperparameter selection, enables substantial computational savings.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dynamic allocation of limited memory resources in reinforcement learning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic resource allocation transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Nisheet Patel, Luigi Acerbi, A. Pouget*\n\n**TL;DR:** This article derives from first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which is applied to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based planning task, and finds that it allocates more resources to items in memory that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards.\n\n**Abstract:** Biological brains are inherently limited in their capacity to process and store information, but are nevertheless capable of solving complex tasks with apparent ease. Intelligent behavior is related to these limitations, since resource constraints drive the need to generalize and assign importance differentially to features in the environment or memories of past experiences. Recently, there have been parallel efforts in reinforcement learning and neuroscience to understand strategies adopted by artificial and biological agents to circumvent limitations in information storage. However, the two threads have been largely separate. In this article, we propose a dynamical framework to maximize expected reward under constraints of limited resources, which we implement with a cost function that penalizes precise representations of action-values in memory, each of which may vary in its precision. We derive from first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which we apply to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based planning task, and find that it allocates more resources to items in memory that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. Moreover, DRA learns faster when starting with a higher resource budget than what it eventually allocates for performing well on tasks, which may explain why frontal cortical areas in biological brains appear more engaged in early stages of learning before settling to lower asymptotic levels of activity. Our work provides a normative solution to the problem of learning how to allocate costly resources to a collection of uncertain memories in a manner that is capable of adapting to changes in the environment.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Compared to the extensively studied online problems with only resource upper bounds, the two-sided constraints affect the prospects of resource consumption more severely. As a result, only limited violations of constraints or pessimistic competitive bounds could be guaranteed. To tackle the challenge, we define a measure of feasibility \u03be \u2217 to evaluate the hardness of this problem, and estimate this measurement by an optimization routine with theoretical guarantees. We propose an on-line algorithm adopting a constructive framework, where we initialize a threshold price vector using the estimation, then dynamically update the price vector and use it for decision-making at each step.

Understanding and Overcoming the Challenges of Efficient Transformer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic resource allocation transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Yelysei Bondarenko, Markus Nagel, Tijmen Blankevoort*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel quantization scheme \u2013 per-embedding-group quantization, and shows that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures have become the de-facto standard models for a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint and high latency are prohibitive for efficient deployment and inference on resource-limited devices. In this work, we explore quantization for transformers. We show that transformers have unique quantization challenges \u2013 namely, high dynamic activation ranges that are difficult to represent with a low bit fixed-point format. We establish that these activations contain structured outliers in the residual connections that encourage specific attention patterns, such as attending to the special separator token. To combat these challenges, we present three solutions based on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, each with a different set of compromises for accuracy, model size, and ease of use. In particular, we introduce a novel quantization scheme \u2013 per-embedding-group quantization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the GLUE benchmark using BERT, establishing state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization. Finally, we show that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss.

This approach integrates with activation recomputation to save memory in both forward and backward passes. MsT is general, implementation-agnostic, and requires minimal code changes. It has been shown to extend the maximum context length of models like Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2 by 12-24x without degrading throughput or convergence.\n\n### Activation Recomputation\nActivation recomputation, or gradient checkpointing, is a technique that trades computation for memory by discarding intermediate activations during the forward pass and recomputing them as needed during the backward pass. This method is orthogonal to MsT and can be integrated to further optimize memory usage.\n\n### Distributed Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT + SP)\nExtending MsT to a distributed setting using sequence parallelism (SP) allows for parallel computation across multiple GPUs. This approach divides the input tensor along the sequence dimension, reducing activation memory requirements substantially. It is compatible with other sequence parallelism methods like Megatron-LM and Deepspeed-Ulysses.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Key-Value (KV) Caching\nKV caching in decoder-only transformers stores and reuses key and value arrays to reduce computational overhead. This technique is particularly useful for long sequences, as it avoids recalculating K and V values for previous tokens. Dynamic compression methods can further reduce the memory usage of KV caches.\n\n### Hierarchical and Linear Attention\nHierarchical attention mechanisms, such as those proposed in H-Transformer-1D, exploit matrix structures to achieve linear run time and memory complexity. These mechanisms are superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals and can be adapted for dynamic resource allocation [Analysis Summary].\n\n### Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB)\nThe CMAB performs constant computation updates, making it significantly more memory efficient than prior methods. This approach ensures that the memory requirements do not grow with the sequence length, allowing for the processing of longer sequences[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Adaptive Computation Strategies\n\n### Gradient Accumulation\nGradient accumulation allows simulating larger batch sizes without exceeding memory constraints by accumulating gradients over several iterations before performing a weight update. This technique is particularly useful for optimizing GPU memory usage.\n\n### Mixed Precision Training\nUsing mixed precision training, where certain operations are performed in lower precision (e.g., float16) while maintaining higher precision (e.g., float32) where necessary, can reduce memory usage and speed up training.\n\n### Dynamic Memory Allocation\nMachine learning-based dynamic memory allocation predicts memory needs based on parameters such as token sequence length, batch size, and model complexity. This approach enables more efficient use of GPU resources and reduces the likelihood of \"CUDA out of memory\" errors.\n\n## Integration and Optimization\n\n### Combining Hierarchical Processing with Efficient Attention\nIntegrating hierarchical normalization with efficient attention mechanisms, such as those using single shared projection matrices or constant memory attention blocks, can optimize memory-computation trade-offs. This integration can be further enhanced by dynamic resource allocation based on sequence characteristics[Analysis Summary].\n\n### Paged Attention and Memory Management\nTechniques like PagedAttention manage memory by swapping cached values into GPU memory when needed, reducing memory fragmentation and underutilization. This approach can be particularly effective in managing KV caches and other memory-intensive components [Analysis Summary].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly efficient in terms of memory usage, computational overhead, and scalability, ultimately leading to better performance on both training and inference tasks.\n",

However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement.

Nevertheless, the quadratic computation complexity can be costly. Some works try to address the limitations of selfattention, including Reformer, Sparse Transformer, Longformer, Linformer (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), etc. They successfully reduce the complexity of self-attention and thus enable processing longer sequences. However, most of them still require linear memory space complexity. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) re-introduces the concept of memory and recurrence. It caches each layer's hidden states of self-attention into a fixed-size queue and re-uses them in the later attention computation. However, the memory as raw hidden states cannot effectively compress highlevel information. Thus, Transformer-XL in practice needs a massive memory size to perform well, and spends huge computation in using its memory. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) improves upon Transformer-XL by further compressing its memories into fewer vectors via a compression network. However, as mentioned in the papers, both Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer discard the information from the distant past, which causes a theoretical maximum tempo-\nral range given the fixed memory size. Inspired by the previous external memory networks, we propose Memformer, which incorporates a fixed-size external dynamic memory combined with the recent Transformer architecture. Memformer interacts with its external dynamic memory through the memory reading and writing modules. Also, we introduce a forgetting mechanism to improve the effectiveness of memorizing new information. By utilizing recurrence and a fixedsize memory, our model has a theoretically infinite temporal range of memorization and implies a linear computation complexity and constant memory space complexity. As the traditional backpropagation through time (BPTT) has an unaffordable memory cost in our model, we introduce a new optimization scheme, memory replay backpropagation (MRBP), to significantly reduce the memory cost in training recurrent neural networks with large size of memory representations. We evaluate Memformer on the autoregressive image generation and language modeling task. Experimental results show that Memformer performs on par with Transformer and Transformer XL with large memory size, while being much more efficient in terms of computation speed and memory space consumption. We also conduct an analysis showing that Memformer can retain information for an extended period. ## 2 Related Work\n\nThis section introduces some recent research directions that aim to alleviate the quadratic cost of selfattention. Moreover, we analyze their assumptions and limitations under the autoregressive setting to provide a broader view of these models. ### 2.1 Sparse Attention\n\nOne influential direction is to replace the full selfattention with sparse attention patterns to speed up the computation. Child et al. (2019) proposed Sparse Transformer, using a block sparse attention pattern to reduce the computation complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Later, Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) further explored this direction and proposed an even more sparse attention pattern to reduce the cost to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. They introduced global tokens to encode the information from the entire sequence and kept the selfattention to the closest $k$ tokens and the global tokens to achieve linear complexity. Although linear sparse attention's theoretical soundness is proven for bidirectional encoders, it does not hold for the decoder. The main reason is that the global tokens cannot leak information to the future tokens in the autoregressive setting, where all the tokens can only see their previous tokens. Thus, linear sparse attention cannot guarantee a token to see its all past tokens. Only Sparse Transformer here with $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ complexity can theoretically cover all the past tokens for the sequence generation. ### 2.2 Linear Attention\n\nAnother direction is focusing on improving the softmax operation in the self-attention. Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ by projecting the entire sequence to a constant size of keys and values, but this method has not been applied to autoregressive decoding. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) used a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps to replace softmax. However, for Linear Transformer under the autoregressive setting, it needs to compute the cumulative summation to aggregate the history information. This assumption is too strong if the input sequence is long and the length is not fixed. After thousands of steps, the numerical values can become very large due to the summation, causing overflow and gradient instability. ### 2.3 Recurrence and Memory\n\nApplying recurrence and memory to Transformers is an orthogonal direction comparing to the efficient attention approaches. If the memory size is constant, recurrence enables the model to have constant memory complexity during inference. There are mainly two works exploring this direction. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) used relative positional encoding and consisted of a segmentlevel recurrence mechanism to encode beyond a fixed-length context. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) extended from Transformer-XL by further compressing the previous cached hidden states to achieve a longer context. However, using past hidden states as memory would cause a theoretical maximum temporal range of context, meaning that a token is not guaranteed to see all the past tokens. Thus, in practice, Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer need huge memory size to achieve good performance. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a5b0bfb29582fd0f4766g-03.jpg?height=915&width=717&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: Memformer overall architecture for the encoder (left) and decoder (right). Transformer encoder is responsible to interact with the memory. Sequence modeling is achieved by predicting the next segment conditioned to the current segment and memory. ### 2.3.1 Dynamic Memorization\n\nWithin the scope of memory networks, there are dynamic memorization techniques. Different from Transformer-XL which stores the token-level history representations as memory, dynamic memorization does not have a theoretical upper bound for the temporal range. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and Differential Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) are two early models that can control external memory resources to achieve long-lasting memory.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: unified memory management transformer attention span\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

We identify input length thresholds (tipping points) at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory). To conduct this analysis for speech, we introduce L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model. We observe that these thresholds are (a) much higher than typical dataset sequence lengths and (b) dependent on the metric and modality, showing that choosing the right model depends on modality, task type (long-form vs. typical context) and resource constraints (time vs. memory). By visualising the breakdown of the computational costs for transformer components, we also show that non-self-attention components exhibit significant computational costs.

Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer attention span*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 3. Long-Span Summarization via Local Attention and Content Selection\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer attention span*\n\n*Potsawee Manakul, M. Gales*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work exploits large pre-trained transformer-based models and address long-span dependencies in abstractive summarization using two methods: local self-attention; and explicit content selection, which can achieve comparable or better results than existing approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including document summarization. Typically these systems are trained by fine-tuning a large pre-trained model to the target task. One issue with these transformer-based models is that they do not scale well in terms of memory and compute requirements as the input length grows. Thus, for long document summarization, it can be challenging to train or fine-tune these models. In this work, we exploit large pre-trained transformer-based models and address long-span dependencies in abstractive summarization using two methods: local self-attention; and explicit content selection. These approaches are compared on a range of network configurations. Experiments are carried out on standard long-span summarization tasks, including Spotify Podcast, arXiv, and PubMed datasets. We demonstrate that by combining these methods, we can achieve state-of-the-art results on all three tasks in the ROUGE scores. Moreover, without a large-scale GPU card, our approach can achieve comparable or better results than existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

A Language Model with Limited Memory Capacity Captures Interference in Human Sentence Processing\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer attention span*\n\n*William Timkey, Tal Linzen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A recurrent neural language model with a single self-attention head, which more closely parallels the memory system assumed by cognitive theories, is developed and it is shown that the model's single attention head captures semantic and syntactic interference effects observed in human experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Two of the central factors believed to underpin human sentence processing difficulty are expectations and retrieval from working memory. A recent attempt to create a unified cognitive model integrating these two factors relied on the parallels between the self-attention mechanism of transformer language models and cue-based retrieval theories of working memory in human sentence processing (Ryu and Lewis 2021). While Ryu and Lewis show that attention patterns in specialized attention heads of GPT-2 are consistent with similarity-based interference, a key prediction of cue-based retrieval models, their method requires identifying syntactically specialized attention heads, and makes the cognitively implausible assumption that hundreds of memory retrieval operations take place in parallel. In the present work, we develop a recurrent neural language model with a single self-attention head, which more closely parallels the memory system assumed by cognitive theories. We show that our model's single attention head captures semantic and syntactic interference effects observed in human experiments.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on unified memory management, attention span adjustment, and dynamic memory allocation strategies, here are some key techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Unified Memory Management\n\n### Blockwise Parallel Processing\nBlockwise parallel transformers can significantly reduce memory costs by computing self-attention and feedforward networks in blocks. This approach enables training sequences that are much longer than those possible with vanilla Transformers, up to 32 times longer in some cases.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nCombining hierarchical normalization with hierarchical attention can be optimized through unified memory management. Hierarchical structures can be unified across attention and normalization layers, enhancing efficiency and reducing memory requirements.\n\n### Dynamic Resource Allocation\nTechniques like PASHA, which involve progressive resource allocation, can dynamically adjust the maximum resources based on the need, consuming significantly fewer computational resources. This approach can be integrated into the training process of transformers to optimize computation-memory trade-offs.\n\n## Dynamic Attention Span Adjustment\n\n### Differential Attention Mechanism\nThe Differential Transformer (DIFF Transformer) introduces a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. This mechanism helps in canceling noise and promoting sparse attention patterns, which can be beneficial for adjusting attention spans dynamically. It has shown improvements in long-context modeling and key information retrieval, and it requires fewer model parameters and training tokens compared to traditional Transformers.\n\n### Adaptive Computation\nAdaptive computation based on sequence characteristics can be implemented by dynamically adjusting attention and normalization parameters. This can involve using multi-armed bandits for resource-efficient optimization, which allows for interactive and optimized pre-training procedures that circumvent costly hyperparameter selection.\n\n## Dynamic Memory Allocation Strategies\n\n### PagedAttention and Mini-Sequence Processing\nPagedAttention and mini-sequence processing are techniques that can be used to manage memory efficiently. PagedAttention involves processing attention in smaller chunks (pages) to reduce memory usage, while mini-sequence processing breaks down long sequences into smaller, more manageable parts. These methods can be combined with blockwise parallel processing to further optimize memory usage.\n\n### Quantization and Memory-Aware Computation\nEfficient transformer quantization techniques can help in reducing memory requirements. For example, the DIFF Transformer retains high performance even at reduced bit-widths (down to 6 bits), which can be beneficial for low-bit FlashAttention implementations and reducing activation outliers. This quantization approach can also help in compressing key-value caches.\n\n### Dynamic KV Cache Management\nDynamic management of key-value (KV) caches can be optimized based on the attention patterns. The sparse attention patterns generated by the differential attention mechanism in DIFF Transformer can be utilized to compress KV caches, further enhancing memory efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more memory-efficient, have dynamic attention span adjustment capabilities, and optimize resource allocation, leading to better overall performance and scalability.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures).

Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** EM-LLM is introduced, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency and providing a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/36 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10297, 2023 b.

The corresponding InfLLM performance is also shown. ## A. 2 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF EM-LLM ALGORITHM\n\nHere, we provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of our Algorithm 1, focusing on the boundary refinement step and the calculation of modularity and conductance metrics. Boundary Refinement Step The boundary refinement step involves finding the optimal position $\\hat{\\beta}$ between each pair of consecutive initial boundaries $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ that optimizes the chosen metric function $f$. This step has the following components:\n\nIteration over initial boundaries: $\\mathcal{O}(k)$, where $k$ is the number of initial boundaries. For each pair of boundaries, we compute the metric function $f$ for all positions between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. In the worst case, this is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ operations per boundary pair. Therefore, the overall complexity of this step is $\\mathcal{O}(k n)$. Metric Function Computation The metric functions (modularity or conductance) are computed at the level of individual memory units. For a memory unit of size $m$ :\n\n- Modularity: The naive computation involves summing over all pairs of nodes within the unit, resulting in a worst-case complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{2}\\right)$. However, in practice, the similarity graph is often sparse, meaning many node pairs have negligible similarity. Leveraging this sparsity, more efficient implementations can achieve $\\mathcal{O}(l)$ complexity, where $l$ is the number of non-zero similarity edges within the unit (Newman, 2004). Typically, $l$ is much smaller than $m^{2}$, especially for larger units, leading to significant computational savings. - Conductance: This requires computing the sum of edge weights crossing the boundary and the total volume of the unit, which can be done in $\\mathcal{O}(m)$ time. Given that $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ and varies for each unit, we can consider the average unit size $\\bar{m}$ and average number of non-zero similarity edges $\\bar{l}$. The total complexity for computing metrics across all units is then $\\mathcal{O}(k \\bar{l})$ for modularity (which in the worst case is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k \\bar{m}^{2}\\right)$, but typically much lower) or $\\mathcal{O}(k \\bar{m})$ for conductance. Overall Complexity Combining the boundary refinement step and metric computation, the overall complexity is:\nFor modularity: $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k n+k \\bar{m}^{2}\\right)$ For conductance: $\\mathcal{O}(k n+k \\bar{m})$\nSince typically $\\bar{m} \\ll n$, the dominant term in both cases is $\\mathcal{O}(k n)$.\n```\n\n#### 4. HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/44 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nH., Gonzalez, J.

Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Probabilistic Subgoal Representations for Hierarchical Reinforcement learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory management implementation benchmarks hierarchical integration*\n\n*V. Wang, Tinghuai Wang, Wenyan Yang, Joni-Kristian K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen, J. Pajarinen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper utilizes Gaussian Processes for the first probabilistic subgoal representation and proposes a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework.\n\n**Abstract:** In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach. Effective HRL hinges on a suitable subgoal represen tation function, abstracting state space into latent subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors. Existing methods adopt a subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to latent subgoal space. Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the first probabilistic subgoal representation. Our method employs a GP prior on the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through learnable kernels. This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework. In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under diverse reward conditions. Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. GPT-ST: Generative Pre-Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory management implementation benchmarks hierarchical integration*\n\n*Zhonghang Li, Lianghao Xia, Yong Xu, Chao Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a spatio-temporal pre- training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance, and introduces an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a rapid development of spatio-temporal prediction techniques in response to the increasing demands of traffic management and travel planning. While advanced end-to-end models have achieved notable success in improving predictive performance, their integration and expansion pose significant challenges. This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a spatio-temporal pre-training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance. The framework is built upon two key designs: (i) We propose a spatio-temporal mask autoencoder as a pre-training model for learning spatio-temporal dependencies. The model incorporates customized parameter learners and hierarchical spatial pattern encoding networks. These modules are specifically designed to capture spatio-temporal customized representations and intra- and inter-cluster region semantic relationships, which have often been neglected in existing approaches. (ii) We introduce an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism. This strategy guides the mask autoencoder in learning robust spatio-temporal representations and facilitates the modeling of different relationships, ranging from intra-cluster to inter-cluster, in an easy-to-hard training manner. Extensive experiments conducted on representative benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We have made our model implementation publicly available at https://github.com/HKUDS/GPT-ST.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: memory management implementation benchmarks hierarchical integration*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory management implementation benchmarks hierarchical integration*\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/39 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

Score: 0.41)\n\n*Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts and works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The utilization of long contexts poses a big challenge for LLMs due to their limited context window size. Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

Recurrent Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer paged attention hierarchical processing*\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 2. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer paged attention hierarchical processing*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Hierarchical Context Merging: Better Long Context Understanding for Pre-trained LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer paged attention hierarchical processing*\n\n*Woomin Song, Seunghyuk Oh, Sangwoo Mo, Jaehyung Kim, Sukmin Yun, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HOMER is presented, a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations of large language models by employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers and proposes an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context.

Revisiting Transformer-based Models for Long Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer paged attention hierarchical processing*\n\n*Xiang Dai, Ilias Chalkidis, S. Darkner, Desmond Elliott*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines several aspects of sparse attention (e.g., size of local attention window, use of global attention) and hierarchical encoding methods of Transformer-based transformers on four document classification datasets covering different domains.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent literature in text classification is biased towards short text sequences (e.g., sentences or paragraphs). In real-world applications, multi-page multi-paragraph documents are common and they cannot be efficiently encoded by vanilla Transformer-based models. We compare different Transformer-based Long Document Classification (TrLDC) approaches that aim to mitigate the computational overhead of vanilla transformers to encode much longer text, namely sparse attention and hierarchical encoding methods. We examine several aspects of sparse attention (e.g., size of local attention window, use of\r\nglobal attention) and hierarchical (e.g., document splitting strategy) transformers on four document classification datasets covering different domains. We observe a clear benefit from being able to process longer text, and, based on our results, we derive practical advice of applying Transformer-based models on\r\nlong document classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Shifted Chunk Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Representational Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer paged attention hierarchical processing*\n\n*Xuefan Zha, Wentao Zhu, Tingxun Lv, Sen Yang, Ji Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks that can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip and outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches onKinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Abstract:** Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various fields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action anticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches primarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the intra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have successfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal learning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract fine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on memory management, hierarchical processing, and efficiency, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Memory Management Techniques in Transformers\n\n### Paged Attention Mechanisms\n- Paged attention mechanisms are crucial for managing long sequences efficiently. The concept of paged attention involves dividing the input sequence into manageable segments (or pages) to reduce computational overhead. This approach is similar to the **segmented input processing** technique mentioned in, where input sequences are divided into segments to process longer contexts without overwhelming computational resources.\n\n### Blockwise Processing Approaches\n- Blockwise processing is another approach to handle long sequences. This method involves processing the input sequence in blocks, which can be seen in the **tensorized attention** approach proposed in. Here, long input sequences are tensorized into compact tensor representations, allowing for more efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n### Memory State Management\n- Memory-augmented neural networks are a significant advancement in managing memory states. By incorporating external memory components, models can store and retrieve information over longer sequences. This is discussed in, where **memory-augmented neural networks** enable models to retain historical context efficiently.\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical Processing\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms allow models to focus on different levels of context. This is achieved by structuring the attention layers hierarchically, enabling models to prioritize information from broader contexts while attending to finer details. This concept is explored in, highlighting the importance of **hierarchical attention mechanisms**.\n\n### Integration with Memory Augmentation\n- Integrating hierarchical processing with memory augmentation can enhance model performance. For instance, the **kNN-based memorizing attention module** in combines memory attention with self-attention, allowing the model to leverage a broader context during inference. This module enhances the model's ability to store and retrieve relevant feature representations efficiently.\n\n### Resource Allocation\n- Dynamic resource allocation is crucial for optimizing the efficiency of hierarchical processing and memory augmentation. The **DynamicResourceAllocator** implementation, as mentioned in your initial analysis, should be compared with existing strategies. For example, **adaptive context windows** in adjust the context window size based on the input complexity, which can be a valuable approach for dynamic resource allocation.\n\n## Efficiency Analysis\n\n### Memory-Augmented Transformers\n- The efficiency of memory-augmented transformers can be evaluated through their ability to handle long sequences and their computational overhead. The **tensorized attention** in reduces computational complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\), making it more efficient for long-sequence modeling.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Systems\n- Hierarchical attention systems can be analyzed for their impact on model efficiency. The hierarchical time stream embedding scheme in and the hierarchical attention mechanisms in demonstrate how these systems can improve model performance while managing computational resources effectively.\n\n### Dynamic Resource Allocation\n- The efficiency of dynamic resource allocation strategies should be evaluated in terms of computational overhead and resource usage. The adaptive context windows and segmented input processing in provide insights into how dynamic allocation can optimize model efficiency.\n\n## Key References and Concepts\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Neural Networks**: discusses the incorporation of external memory components to store and retrieve information over longer sequences.\n- **Tensorized Attention**: introduces a method to scale up the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences, which is efficient and scalable.\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: explains how hierarchical attention allows models to focus on different levels of context, enhancing performance and efficiency.\n- **Paged Attention and Blockwise Processing**: These concepts, while not explicitly named in the sources, are akin to the segmented input processing and tensorized attention methods discussed in and.\n\nBy integrating these concepts and techniques, the researcher can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical processing, memory augmentation, and dynamic resource allocation effectively.\n",

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nURL http://arxiv.org/abs/2105. 08209. 2,8\n[18] Kwon, W., Li, Z., Zhuang, S., Sheng, Y., Zheng, L., Yu, C.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: PagedAttention implementation memory efficient hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: PagedAttention implementation memory efficient hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

Nevertheless, applying them in industrial production requires tedious and heavy works to reduce inference costs. To fill such a gap, we introduce a scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels. First, we design highly optimized kernels for long inputs and large hidden sizes. Second, we propose a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model.

Tempo: Accelerating Transformer-Based Model Training through Memory Footprint Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: PagedAttention implementation memory efficient hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Muralidhar Andoorveedu, Zhanda Zhu, Bojian Zheng, Gennady Pekhimenko*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Tempo, a new approach to efficiently use accelerator memory resources for training Transformer-based models, which provides drop-in replacements for the GELU, LayerNorm, and Attention layers, reducing the memory usage and ultimately leading to more efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Training deep learning models can be computationally expensive. Prior works have shown that increasing the batch size can potentially lead to better overall throughput. However, the batch size is frequently limited by the accelerator memory capacity due to the activations/feature maps stored for the training backward pass, as larger batch sizes require larger feature maps to be stored. Transformer-based models, which have recently seen a surge in popularity due to their good performance and applicability to a variety of tasks, have a similar problem. To remedy this issue, we propose Tempo, a new approach to efficiently use accelerator (e.g., GPU) memory resources for training Transformer-based models. Our approach provides drop-in replacements for the GELU, LayerNorm, and Attention layers, reducing the memory usage and ultimately leading to more efficient training. We implement Tempo and evaluate the throughput, memory usage, and accuracy/loss on the BERT Large pre-training task. We demonstrate that Tempo enables up to 2x higher batch sizes and 16% higher training throughput over the state-of-the-art baseline. We also evaluate Tempo on GPT2 and RoBERTa models, showing 19% and 26% speedup over the baseline.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on memory efficiency, hierarchical processing, and dynamic resource allocation, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## PagedAttention Implementation Details\n\n### Memory Management Techniques\n- PagedAttention is a technique that optimizes memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks. This approach allows for efficient storage of attention keys and values, particularly beneficial for scenarios involving longer sequences. It is implemented in frameworks like vLLM, which enhances serving performance by reducing memory usage and improving computation speed.\n\n### Cache Optimization Strategies\n- PagedAttention employs non-contiguous storage of attention keys and values, which significantly boosts serving performance. This method also integrates with other optimization techniques such as continuous batching and quantization (e.g., FP16) to minimize memory usage and enhance computational efficiency.\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n- Evaluations of PagedAttention-based systems, such as vLLM, show improved performance metrics. For instance, vLLM reduces waiting times and optimizes resource utilization through continuous batching, leading to faster computations and better memory management.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Hierarchical Transformers\n\n### State Compression Methods\n- Techniques like HCache involve recomputing the KV cache from smaller intermediate activations (hidden states) instead of original tokens. This approach reduces the size of the KV cache by half and eliminates computationally intensive modules like the attention mechanism and feed-forward network (FFN), thus reducing computation costs.\n\n### Information Flow Optimization\n- Hierarchical context merging strategies, such as those used in HOMER, divide long inputs into manageable chunks and process them collectively using a hierarchical approach. This method merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers, reducing memory requirements and optimizing information flow[Analysis Note].\n\n### Resource Utilization Patterns\n- Memory-efficient hierarchical transformers often balance local and global information processing. For example, the Recurrent Memory Transformer stores and processes both local and global information, allowing for the passage of information between segments of long sequences with the help of recurrence[Analysis Note].\n\n## Dynamic Resource Allocation\n\n### Adaptive Computation Strategies\n- Dynamic memory allocation techniques, such as those used in HCache, involve both recomputation and IO transmission. To address the varying completion times of these steps, a bubble-free restoration scheduler is used to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks. This ensures efficient use of both GPU computational and IO resources.\n\n### Memory-Computation Trade-offs\n- Optimizing the execution plan to avoid unnecessary memory overhead is crucial. Techniques like PagedAttention and HCache reduce memory usage while introducing some computational overhead. For instance, HCache reduces IO transmission time by recomputing KV cache from hidden states, which is half the size of the KV cache.\n\n### Efficiency Metrics\n- Efficiency metrics for these systems include reductions in Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Token (TBT). For example, HCache reduces TTFT by up to 1.93 compared to KV offload and up to 5.73 compared to token recomputation, with less than 4% overhead on TBT.\n\nIn summary, the integration of PagedAttention with hierarchical processing, as proposed in MemHierGPT, can be significantly enhanced by:\n\n- Utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks for efficient attention key and value storage.\n- Implementing state compression methods like HCache to reduce KV cache size and computational costs.\n- Employing hierarchical context merging strategies to optimize information flow and reduce memory requirements.\n- Implementing dynamic resource allocation strategies that balance computation and IO tasks efficiently.\n\nThese approaches can help achieve better memory efficiency, computational performance, and overall scalability for autoregressive language models.\n",

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5884-5888, 2018. doi: 10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462506.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Qianchao Zhu, Jiangfei Duan, Chang Chen, Siran Liu, Xiuhong Li, Guanyu Feng, Xin Lv, Huanqi Cao, Chuanfu Xiao, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin, Chao Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention, which can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times compared with FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/25 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.00752, 2023.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Generative Pre-trained Speech Language Model with Efficient Hierarchical Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer hierarchical integration*\n\n*Yongxin Zhu, Dan Su, Liqiang He, Linli Xu, Dong Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{P}re-trained \\textbf{S}peech \\textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

A Language Model with Limited Memory Capacity Captures Interference in Human Sentence Processing\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer hierarchical integration*\n\n*William Timkey, Tal Linzen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A recurrent neural language model with a single self-attention head, which more closely parallels the memory system assumed by cognitive theories, is developed and it is shown that the model's single attention head captures semantic and syntactic interference effects observed in human experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Two of the central factors believed to underpin human sentence processing difficulty are expectations and retrieval from working memory. A recent attempt to create a unified cognitive model integrating these two factors relied on the parallels between the self-attention mechanism of transformer language models and cue-based retrieval theories of working memory in human sentence processing (Ryu and Lewis 2021). While Ryu and Lewis show that attention patterns in specialized attention heads of GPT-2 are consistent with similarity-based interference, a key prediction of cue-based retrieval models, their method requires identifying syntactically specialized attention heads, and makes the cognitively implausible assumption that hundreds of memory retrieval operations take place in parallel. In the present work, we develop a recurrent neural language model with a single self-attention head, which more closely parallels the memory system assumed by cognitive theories. We show that our model's single attention head captures semantic and syntactic interference effects observed in human experiments.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Probabilistic Subgoal Representations for Hierarchical Reinforcement learning\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer hierarchical integration*\n\n*V. Wang, Tinghuai Wang, Wenyan Yang, Joni-Kristian K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen, J. Pajarinen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper utilizes Gaussian Processes for the first probabilistic subgoal representation and proposes a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework.\n\n**Abstract:** In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach. Effective HRL hinges on a suitable subgoal represen tation function, abstracting state space into latent subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors. Existing methods adopt a subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to latent subgoal space. Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the first probabilistic subgoal representation. Our method employs a GP prior on the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through learnable kernels. This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework. In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under diverse reward conditions. Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Chasing Sparsity in Vision Transformers: An End-to-End Exploration\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer hierarchical integration*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng, Zhe Gan, Lu Yuan, Lei Zhang, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration of a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs from end to end is carried out, and it is found that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\".\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but their enormous model sizes and training costs remain daunting. Conventional post-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this paper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference complexity, without sacrificing the achievable accuracy. We carry out the first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs\"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of training full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while sticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes model parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with one sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended from unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide the prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. We further co-explore data and architecture sparsity for additional efficiency gains by plugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital patches. Extensive results on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals which obtain significantly reduced computational cost and almost unimpaired generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at (5%, 50%) sparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.

Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: unified memory management transformer hierarchical integration*\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/epfml/landmark-attention/.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 110  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on unified memory management, hierarchical integration, and performance analysis, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Unified Memory Management Systems in Transformers\n\n### Integration with Hierarchical Processing\n- The concept of hierarchical memory management is crucial for efficient transformer training. The \"Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT)\" approach, for instance, optimizes intermediate memory usage by processing sequences in smaller chunks. This method integrates well with hierarchical processing by dividing the input tensor along the sequence dimension, allowing for parallel computation across multiple GPUs. This is detailed in the paper on MsT, which discusses how this approach reduces activation memory requirements and scales transformer models effectively.\n\n### Memory-Computation Trade-offs\n- The trade-off between memory usage and computational overhead is a significant consideration. Techniques like state compression through recomputation and hierarchical context merging strategies help balance local and global information processing. For example, the \"Tempo\" approach reduces memory usage by providing drop-in replacements for layers like GELU, LayerNorm, and Attention, which ultimately leads to more efficient training.\n\n### System Architecture Design\n- The design of unified memory management systems involves careful integration of hierarchical processing. For instance, the \"PagedAttention\" implementation uses non-contiguous memory allocation for KV cache, which significantly boosts serving performance through efficient memory allocation and cache optimization. This approach can be integrated with hierarchical processing to enhance overall efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Performance Analysis\n\n### Combined Memory Management Approaches\n- The performance of combined memory management approaches can be analyzed through benchmarks. For example, the MsT approach extends to distributed settings using sequence parallelism (SP), which effectively scales the transformer by reducing activation memory requirements. This is orthogonal to other sequence parallelism methods like Megatron-LM and Deepspeed-Ulysses, and the combination shows substantial performance improvements.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing Overhead\n- Hierarchical processing can introduce overhead, but optimized designs can mitigate this. The \"H-Transformer-1D\" proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism with linear run time and memory complexity, which reduces the overhead associated with traditional attention mechanisms[Analysis Note].\n\n### Resource Utilization Patterns\n- Resource utilization patterns are critical for efficient model training. Techniques like continuous batching and hardware-aware optimizations improve resource utilization. For instance, the MsT approach with DeepSpeed-Ulysses ensures efficient communication of attention block matrices through all-to-all collectives, optimizing resource usage.\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n\n### Memory-Hierarchy Integration\n- Integrating memory hierarchies involves optimizing memory access patterns. The \"Flashattention\" and \"Xformer\" approaches use kernel fusion and optimized memory access patterns to achieve linear memory scaling, which is essential for handling long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Cache Optimization\n- Cache optimization is vital for performance. The \"PagedAttention\" implementation, for example, employs non-contiguous storage of attention keys and values, which significantly boosts serving performance through efficient memory allocation and cache optimization[Analysis Note].\n\n### Resource Allocation\n- Dynamic resource allocation strategies are important. The \"MemHierGPT\" proposal includes a dynamic resource allocation strategy that differs from existing approaches, emphasizing the need for flexible and adaptive resource management to optimize performance[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the following references and concepts are particularly relevant:\n\n- **Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT)**: Optimizes intermediate memory usage and integrates well with hierarchical processing, reducing activation memory requirements and scaling transformer models effectively.\n- **PagedAttention**: Employs non-contiguous memory allocation for KV cache, integrating well with hierarchical processing and optimizing cache performance[Analysis Note].\n- **Tempo**: Reduces memory usage by optimizing layer implementations, leading to more efficient training.\n- **H-Transformer-1D**: Proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism with linear complexity, reducing overhead[Analysis Note].\n\nThese approaches and strategies can help in designing a more efficient and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",
