Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 65/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nWe give several models an \"improved recipe\", inspired by changes adopted by popular large language models such as PaLM (Chowdhery et al. 2023) and LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023).

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

However, there are several challenges for learning operators in practical applications like the irregular mesh, multiple input functions, and complexity of the PDEs' solution. To address these challenges, we propose a general neural operator transformer (GNOT), a scalable and effective transformer-based framework for learning operators. By designing a novel heterogeneous normalized attention layer, our model is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular meshes. Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems. The large model capacity of the transformer architecture grants our model the possibility to scale to large datasets and practical problems. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets from different domains and achieve a remarkable improvement compared with alternative methods.

Crossformer: Transformer Utilizing Cross-Dimension Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: SwiGLU Transformer*\n\n*Yunhao Zhang, Junchi Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** In Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise embedding to preserve time and dimension information and the Two-Stage Attention layer is proposed to capture the cross-time and cross- dimension dependency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently many deep models have been proposed for multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. In particular, Transformer-based models have shown great potential because they can capture long-term dependency. However, existing Transformer-based models mainly focus on modeling the temporal dependency (cross-time dependency) yet often omit the dependency among different variables (cross-dimension dependency), which is critical for MTS forecasting. To \ufb01ll the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting. In Crossformer, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention (TSA) layer is proposed to ef\ufb01ciently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing DSW embedding and TSA layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (HED) to use the information at different scales for the \ufb01nal forecasting.

PixArt-\u03b1: Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer for Photorealistic Text-to-Image Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: SwiGLU Transformer*\n\n*Junsong Chen, Jincheng Yu, Chongjian Ge, Lewei Yao, Enze Xie, Yue Wu, Zhongdao Wang, James T. Kwok, Ping Luo, Huchuan Lu, Zhenguo Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** PIXART-$\\alpha$ is introduced, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards.\n\n**Abstract:** The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-$\\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-$\\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART-$\\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \\$300,000 (\\$26,000 vs. \\$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-$\\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-$\\alpha$ will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 177  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n#### 5.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Globally Gated Deep Linear Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Units*\n\n*Qianyi Li, H.

In this work, we introduce a novel gating architecture, named Globally Gated Deep Linear Networks (GGDLNs) where gating units are shared among all processing units in each layer, thereby decoupling the architectures of the nonlinear but unlearned gatings and the learned linear processing motifs. We derive exact equations for the generalization properties in these networks in the finite-width thermodynamic limit, defined by $P,N\\rightarrow\\infty, P/N\\sim O(1)$, where P and N are the training sample size and the network width respectively. We find that the statistics of the network predictor can be expressed in terms of kernels that undergo shape renormalization through a data-dependent matrix compared to the GP kernels. Our theory accurately captures the behavior of finite width GGDLNs trained with gradient descent dynamics. We show that kernel shape renormalization gives rise to rich generalization properties w.r.t. network width, depth and L2 regularization amplitude. Interestingly, networks with sufficient gating units behave similarly to standard ReLU networks. Although gatings in the model do not participate in supervised learning, we show the utility of unsupervised learning of the gating parameters. Additionally, our theory allows the evaluation of the network's ability for learning multiple tasks by incorporating task-relevant information into the gating units. In summary, our work is the first exact theoretical solution of learning in a family of nonlinear networks with finite width. The rich and diverse behavior of the GGDLNs suggests that they are helpful analytically tractable models of learning single and multiple tasks, in finite-width nonlinear deep networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many\nadvances have been made with other transformer architectures and training\nconfigurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here,\nwe introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe\nthat is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture\nincorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear\nUnits (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision\nLayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe\nincludes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective,\nbfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in\naddition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When\npretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a\ndownstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs\nat a cost of roughly $20.

Hyena Neural Operator for Partial Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: Hyena Operator*\n\n*Amir Barati Farimani, Zijie Li, Saurabh Patil*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerically solving partial differential equations typically requires fine discretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new approach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of neural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn mappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial differential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural operator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is parameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation that enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long convolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the model's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight for different partial differential equations instances. To measure how effective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct experiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our findings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate model for learning partial differential equations solution operator.

Polyphonic audio tagging with sequentially labelled data using CRNN with learnable gated linear units\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Units*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Audio tagging aims to detect the types of sound events occurring in an audio\nrecording. To tag the polyphonic audio recordings, we propose to use\nConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function on the top of\nConvolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with learnable Gated Linear Units\n(GLU-CTC), based on a new type of audio label data: Sequentially Labelled Data\n(SLD). In GLU-CTC, CTC objective function maps the frame-level probability of\nlabels to clip-level probability of labels. To compare the mapping ability of\nGLU-CTC for sound events, we train a CRNN with GLU based on Global Max Pooling\n(GLU-GMP) and a CRNN with GLU based on Global Average Pooling (GLU-GAP). And we\nalso compare the proposed GLU-CTC system with the baseline system, which is a\nCRNN trained using CTC loss function without GLU. The experiments show that the\nGLU-CTC achieves an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.882 in audio tagging,\noutperforming the GLU-GMP of 0.803, GLU-GAP of 0.766 and baseline system of\n0.837. That means based on the same CRNN model with GLU, the performance of CTC\nmapping is better than the GMP and GAP mapping. Given both based on the CTC\nmapping, the CRNN with GLU outperforms the CRNN without GLU.\n\n**Published:** 2018-11-17\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Much of the success of Transformers, powered by the attention operator (Vaswani et al., 2017), relies on their scaling properties (Hoffmann et al., 2022) and the emergence of in-context learning (Garg et al., 2022), which allows them to generalize to unseen data and tasks given context as input. The Transformer block is a powerful tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its limitations. One of the most notable is the computational cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input sequence increases. Specifically, the cost scales quadratically with the length $L$ of the sequence, which places a strict limit on the amount of context that can be considered by the model. Breaking the quadratic barrier is a key step towards new possibilities for deep learning, such as using entire textbooks as context, generating long-form music or processing gigapixel scale images. Efforts to reduce the computational cost of attention in models primarily involve the use of linearized, low-rank, and sparse approximations (Child et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2022). These approaches introduce a trade-off between expressivity and speed, requiring hybridization with standard attention layers to reach Transformer quality (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). A growing amount of evidence suggests that attention mechanisms only utilize a small portion of their quadratic capabilities for language processing (Olsson et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c), leading us to question its role as the gold-standard operator for deep learning at scale. Specifically, we ask:\n\nAre there subquadratic operators that can match the quality of attention at scale? [^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6994c3a61e16d3fc4e33g-02.jpg?height=436&width=1661&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=229)\n\nFigure 1.1: The Hyena operator is defined as a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: an implicit long convolution $h$ (i.e. Hyena filters parameterized by a feed-forward network) and multiplicative elementwise gating of the (projected) input. The depth of the recurrence specifies the size of the operator. Hyena can equivalently be expressed as a multiplication with data-controlled (conditioned by the input u) diagonal matrices $D_{x}$ and Toeplitz matrices $S_{h}$. In addition, Hyena exhibits sublinear parameter scaling (in sequence length) and unrestricted context, similar to attention, while having lower time complexity. We obtain a positive answer based on a composition of efficient subquadratic primitives, such as elementwise multiplication (gating) and long convolutions i.e., convolutions with filter sizes as long as the input. We rely on a set of targeted reasoning tasks, grounded in recent work on mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Power et al., 2022; Olsson et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) such as recall and induction, to distill three properties of attention correlated with its performance and the quality gap with existing subquadratic approaches:\na. Data control: Attention implements an expressive data-controlled (Massaroli et al., 2020) linear operator ${ }^{1}$, encoding an entire family of linear functions in a single block. b. Sublinear parameter scaling: Parameter counts of attention layers are decoupled from sequence length, allowing Transformers to allocate more parameters elsewhere e.g., the feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) between attention layers. c. Unrestricted context: For a given input, attention has an unrestricted context i.e., it can approximate dependencies between any two inputs, without arbitrary restrictions such as locality (except in cases using masking such as autoregressive models). The Hyena hierarchy Guided by these findings, we introduce the Hyena hierarchy, an operator defined by a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: a long convolution and element-wise multiplicative gating (see Figure 1.1). A specified depth (i.e., number of steps) of the recurrence controls the size of the operator. For short recurrences, existing models are recovered as special cases (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). By mapping each step in the Hyena recurrence to its corresponding matrix form, we reveal Hyena operators to be equivalently defined as a decomposition of a data-controlled matrix i.e., a matrix whose entries are functions of the input. Furthermore, we show how Hyena operators can be evaluated efficiently without materializing the full matrix, by leveraging fast convolution algorithms (Selesnick and Burrus, 2017). Empirically, Hyena operators are able to significantly shrink the quality gap with attention at scale, reaching similar perplexity and downstream performance with a smaller computational budget (Section 4.2 ) and without hybridization of attention. Narrowing the capabilities gap The design of Hyena is motivated by a quality gap between standard dense attention and alternative subquadratic operators, which we identify by focusing on reasoning tasks correlated with language modeling performance at scale. We extend the suite of basic mechanistic interpretability benchmarks (induction and recall) with additional tasks that probe how quickly model performance degrades\n\n[^1]when task complexity increases (e.g. vocabulary size grows). In addition, we investigate the optimal parameterization of long convolutions in Hyena. In the most challenging settings with hundreds of thousands of tokens, our implicit parameterization scheme improves over other operators leveraging state spaces (Gu et al., 2021), frequency-domain parametrizations (Li et al., 2020), or standard convolutions by over $50 \\%$ accuracy. Scaling in language and vision Next, we aim to verify whether rankings in our reasoning benchmark suite are predictive of quality at scale. We test Hyena on autoregressive language modeling at the sub-billion parameter scale, setting a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile) and matching Transformer quality. On the The Pile at the 335M parameter scale, we match Transformer perplexity with a $20 \\%$ reduction in the total count of floating point operations (FLOPs). As an extension, we investigate the generality of Hyena operators by testing on large-scale image recognition, replacing attention in the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). In image classification, Hyena is able to match attention in accuracy when training on ImageNet-1k from scratch. Toward much longer context Finally, we benchmark the efficiency of Hyena on long sequences. We measure 5x speedups over dense self-attention at length $8192-2 \\mathrm{x}$ over highly optimized FlashAttention ${ }^{2}$ (Dao et al., 2022b) - and 100x speedup over FlashAttention at sequence lengths of 64 k , where standard attention implementation in PyTorch runs out of memory. ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nA discrete convolution is a function of two arguments: an input $u$ signal of length $L$ and a learnable filter $h$. The linear (aperiodic) convolution of a (possibly infinitely long) measurable ${ }^{3}$ filter $h$ with a length- $L$ input signal $u$ is defined as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=(h * u)_{t}=\\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} h_{t-n} u_{n}\n$$\n\nGenerally, $u_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ where $D$ is the width of the signal, or in deep learning parlance, the number of channels. Without loss of generality, we specialize our analysis to single input single output (SISO) layers, i.e. with $D=1$. The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) case, canonical in standard convolutional layers, follows directly. In this case, the input signal can be represented as a vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ and the convolution as a matrix-vector product between the input and the Toeplitz kernel matrix $\\mathrm{S}_{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ induced by the filter $h$ :\n\n$$\n(h * u)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nh_{0} & h_{-1} & \\cdots & h_{-L+1} \\\\\nh_{1} & h_{0} & \\cdots & h_{-L+2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nh_{L-1} & h_{L-2} & \\cdots & h_{0}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nu_{0} \\\\\nu_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_{L-1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n### 2.1 Explicit and Implicit Convolutions\n\nParametrizing and optimizing convolution filters $h_{t}$ is a standard procedure in deep learning and more broadly signal processing. The classical approach of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Fukushima and Miyake, 1982; LeCun et al., 1998; Ronneberger et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) is to optimize directly the values $h_{t}$ of the filter's response at $M$ prescribed steps, a parametrization we call explicit.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/63 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\n4 for additional vision architectures and training procedure details.

Hyena operators are a recurrence of gating and implicitly parametrized long convolutions, can be evaluated efficiently in subquadratic time, and can learn in-context on very long sequences. On The Pile, deep stacks of Hyena operators constitute one of the first attention-free, convolutional architectures to match perplexity and downstream performance of Transformers with a significant reduction in training compute. Our promising results at the sub-billion parameter scale suggest that attention may not be all we need, and that simpler subquadratic designs such as Hyena, informed by a set of simple guiding principles and evaluation on mechanistic interpretability benchmarks, may form the basis for efficient large models. We are excited about what new capabilities Hyena opens up as we scale and optimize the inference speed of these models. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Avanika Narayan, Khaled Saab, Michael Zhang, Elliot Epstein and Sabri Eyuboglu for helpful discussion and feedback on earlier drafts, and Together Computer and Crusoe for providing the compute used to train models in this paper.

Laughing Hyena Distillery: Extracting Compact Recurrences From Convolutions (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli, Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Rom N.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling (Avg.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters.

Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models in Transformers*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models in Transformers*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models in Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 216  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 4. A Generalization of ViT/MLP-Mixer to Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: Long-range Dependency MLP*\n\n*Xiaoxin He, Bryan Hooi, T. Laurent, Adam Perold, Yann LeCun, X. Bresson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a new class of GNNs, called Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties: they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing, offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, and show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range Graph Benchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them.

TopicRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency\n\n*From Search Query: Long-range Dependency MLP*\n\n*Adji B. Dieng, Chong Wang, Jianfeng Gao, J. Paisley*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence \u2013 both semantic and syntactic \u2013 but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis and report a new state-of-the-art error rate on the IMDB movie review dataset that amounts to a 13.3% improvement over the previous best result. Finally TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 234  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 6. Modelling Long Range Dependencies in N-D: From Task-Specific to a General Purpose CNN\n\n*From Search Query: Long-range Dependency MLP*\n\n*David M. Knigge, David W. Romero, Albert Gu, E. Gavves, E. Bekkers, Jakub M. Tomczak, M. Hoogendoorn, J. Sonke*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Continuous Convolutional Neural Network is presented: a single CNN able to process data of arbitrary resolution, dimensionality and length without any structural changes, and often outperforms the current state-of-the-art across all tasks considered.\n\n**Abstract:** Performant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures must be tailored to specific tasks in order to consider the length, resolution, and dimensionality of the input data. In this work, we tackle the need for problem-specific CNN architectures. We present the Continuous Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN): a single CNN able to process data of arbitrary resolution, dimensionality and length without any structural changes. Its key component are its continuous convolutional kernels which model long-range dependencies at every layer, and thus remove the need of current CNN architectures for task-dependent downsampling and depths. We showcase the generality of our method by using the same architecture for tasks on sequential ($1{\\rm D}$), visual ($2{\\rm D}$) and point-cloud ($3{\\rm D}$) data. Our CCNN matches and often outperforms the current state-of-the-art across all tasks considered.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models in Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models in Transformers*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Sequencer: Deep LSTM for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Long-range Dependency MLP*\n\n*Masato Taki, Yuki Tatsunami*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent computer vision research, the advent of the Vision Transformer (ViT) has rapidly revolutionized various architectural design efforts: ViT achieved state-of-the-art image classification performance using self-attention found in natural language processing, and MLP-Mixer achieved competitive performance using simple multi-layer perceptrons. In contrast, several studies have also suggested that carefully redesigned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve advanced performance comparable to ViT without resorting to these new ideas. Against this background, there is growing interest in what inductive bias is suitable for computer vision. Here we propose Sequencer, a novel and competitive architecture alternative to ViT that provides a new perspective on these issues. Unlike ViTs, Sequencer models long-range dependencies using LSTMs rather than self-attention layers. We also propose a two-dimensional version of Sequencer module, where an LSTM is decomposed into vertical and horizontal LSTMs to enhance performance. Despite its simplicity, several experiments demonstrate that Sequencer performs impressively well: Sequencer2D-L, with 54M parameters, realizes 84.6% top-1 accuracy on only ImageNet-1K. Not only that, we show that it has good transferability and the robust resolution adaptability on double resolution-band.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Beyond Self-attention: External Attention using Two Linear Layers for Visual Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Long-range Dependency MLP*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Tai-Jiang Mu, Zheng-Ning Liu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms, especially self-attention, have played an increasingly important role in deep feature representation for visual tasks. Self-attention updates the feature at each position by computing a weighted sum of features using pair-wise affinities across all positions to capture the long-range dependency within a single sample. However, self-attention has quadratic complexity and ignores potential correlation between different samples. This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism which we call external attention, based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two normalization layers; it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing popular architectures. External attention has linear complexity and implicitly considers the correlations between all data samples. We further incorporate the multi-head mechanism into external attention to provide an all-MLP architecture, external attention MLP (EAMLP), for image classification. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, image generation, and point cloud analysis reveal that our method provides results comparable or superior to the self-attention mechanism and some of its variants, with much lower computational and memory costs.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating Hyena Operators and state space models into the MLP component of Transformer architectures, here are some key points and useful information that can guide the process:\n\n## Integration of Hyena Operators\n\n- **Hyena Operators as MLP Replacements**: Research indicates that Hyena Operators can effectively replace or augment MLP layers in Transformer architectures. They capture long-range dependencies through data-dependent gating and long convolutions, which can be particularly beneficial for modeling sequential data.\n- **Implementation Considerations**: When integrating Hyena Operators, it is crucial to consider parameter initialization and training dynamics to ensure stability and convergence. The gating mechanisms in Hyena Operators can align well with the gating in GatedMLP, facilitating a seamless integration.\n\n## Integration of State Space Models\n\n- **State Space Models in MLP**: State space models (SSMs) can be integrated into the MLP component to model sequential data efficiently. SSMs maintain a latent state, which helps in capturing temporal dependencies that standard MLPs might miss. This integration can complement the attention mechanism and improve the model's efficiency, especially for long sequences.\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: The use of SSMs can lead to improved efficiency due to their linear computational complexity. This is particularly advantageous for handling long sequences, as it reduces the computational overhead associated with traditional MLPs.\n\n## Practical Implementation Strategies\n\n- **Modification of GatedMLP**: To integrate Hyena Operators and SSMs, the standard linear transformations and activation functions in the GatedMLP can be replaced with Hyena Operator-based convolutions and SSM parameterizations. Retaining the gating functions of the GatedMLP while enhancing them with data-dependent gating from Hyena Operators can improve expressiveness.\n- **Code Repositories and Implementation Guides**: Searching for code repositories or detailed implementation guides will be essential. For example, looking into repositories that have implemented similar integrations, such as the ProtHyena model which uses Hyena operators in a decoder-only LM, can provide practical insights.\n\n## Training and Stability\n\n- **Training Techniques**: Addressing training challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients is crucial. Techniques like proper initialization, gradient clipping, and adaptive learning rates can help ensure training stability. Reviewing studies that have integrated similar components can provide valuable insights into overcoming these challenges.\n- **Empirical Evidence**: Gathering empirical results from studies that have integrated Hyena Operators or SSMs into MLP layers is vital. This will help in understanding the impact on performance and efficiency, as well as identifying any common challenges and solutions.\n\n## Future Search Directions\n\n### Detailed Implementation Resources\n- Search for code repositories, such as GitHub, or implementation guides that detail the integration of Hyena Operators and SSMs into MLP layers. For instance, looking into the implementation details of ProtHyena can be beneficial.\n\n### Training Procedures\n- Investigate training procedures and techniques used in similar integrations. This includes understanding how to handle vanishing/exploding gradients, optimize convergence, and ensure model stability.\n\n### Empirical Results\n- Review studies and experiments where Hyena Operators or SSMs have been integrated into MLP layers. Analyze the results to understand the impact on performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and computational efficiency.\n\n### Comparison with Alternative Approaches\n- Compare the proposed integration with other methods of enhancing the MLP component, such as using attention mechanisms within the MLP (e.g., GEGLU with attention). This will help in ensuring that the chosen approach is the most effective.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather the necessary information to design and implement a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates Hyena Operators and state space models, potentially leading to enhanced performance and efficiency in language modeling tasks.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/56 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nThis suggests that the training sequence length should be carefully chosen according to the intended downstream use of the model. ### 6.2. Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis confirms recent findings at smaller scales (Park et al. 2024). In particular, we highlight the difficulty pure SSM models face with the standard five-shot MMLU (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020) and two-shot Phonebook tasks. For the former, after training for 1.1 T tokens, both Mamba and Mamba-2 models produce nearly 15 points lower accuracy when compared to a Transformer model on this task. While the MMLU accuracy gap is partially addressed by training with more tokens (e.g., 3.5T tokens), SSM models still lag behind Transformer models for this common benchmark. We find that Phonebook and standard long-context benchmark tasks remain challenging for SSM models regardless of the number of training tokens. Based on the above findings, we study in detail the potential for hybrid SSM-Transformer models to overcome the challenges faced by pure SSM architectures while retaining (some of) their inferencetime benefits. Similar to Lieber et al. 2024, we focus on LLMs consisting of a mixture of Mamba-2, self-attention, and MLP layers. Our ablation experiments aiming to identify the best hybrid model architecture lead us to design an 8B-parameter Mamba-2-Hybrid with 24 Mamba-2 layers, 4 self-attention layers, and 28 MLP layers. The self-attention and MLP layers are evenly distributed throughout the model. Extensive evaluations of this architecture show that it matches or exceeds Transformers on common natural language evaluations. When training for 3.5 T tokens, a Mamba-2-Hybrid model exceeds a corresponding Transformer on all 12 short-context benchmarks we evaluated. On MMLU, the hybrid model reaches a five-shot accuracy 3.5 points higher than the Transformer. We also study long-context extensions of Mamba-2-Hybrid and the corresponding Transformer to support 16 K and 32 K context lengths. On 23 long-context evaluations, the 16 K and 32 K models closely match or exceed the Transformer baselines on average. Our results show that the hybrid models are particularly good at retrieving, tracking, and aggregating information over long contexts. We highlight three multi-document question answering tasks, however, which challenged the long-context hybrid models. We discuss potential reasons for these results and highlight areas of future work related to\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_b92355d6bd48fca7f050g-03.jpg?height=744&width=1491&top_left_y=190&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 1: Mamba and Mamba-2 blocks with tensor model parallel size two. Mamba requires two all-reduces per layer while Mamba-2 requires only one. More details can be found in Dao and Gu 2024. extending hybrid SSM-Transformer models to long sequence lengths. Finally we highlight that, due to our use of global attention without any explicit position encoding in these models, long-context Mamba-2-Hybrid models can generalize beyond their trained sequence length. This is in contrast with recent hybrid models that use windowed attention and exhibit accuracy degradation on contexts larger than the window size but less than the pretraining sequence length (De et al. 2024). We find that a Mamba-2-Hybrid extended to support 128 K contexts can perform the Phonebook lookup task perfectly even when the phone book contains more than 150 K tokens. We present our findings above to highlight the promise for larger-scale SSM-based models to provide faster, more efficient language model inference without compromising training efficiency or model accuracy compared to Transformers. We hope that by releasing these results, the community is further excited by the potential of Mamba-based LLMs. To help enable further adoption, we release the code used to train our Mamba, Mamba-2, and Mamba-2-Hybrid hybrid models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM library (https:// github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). We also release the model weights for our Mamba-2 8B and Mamba-2-Hybrid 8B on Hugging Face. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we discuss briefly our implementation of SSM layers in Megatron-LM and discuss the training data and evaluations used throughout this report. ### 2.1 Model Implementation\n\nTo support efficient large-scale training, we implement Mamba and Mamba-2 layers with support for tensor (Shoeybi et al. 2019), sequence (Korthikanti et al. 2022), and pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al. 2021) (only for Mamba-2). As described in Dao and Gu 2024, tensor-parallel support for Mamba layers requires two all-reduces per block compared to just one all-reduce for Transformer layers (Figure 1), leading to increased communication overheads for training larger-scale Mamba models. Mamba-2 tensor parallel support, on the other hand, requires only one all-reduce per layer, but requires the use of GroupNorm rather than LayerNorm for the internal block normalization (see Figure 1). We found that using GroupNorm lead to no difference in validation loss when compared to using full LayerNorm as long as the group size (the model hidden dimension divided by the number of groups) is sufficiently large to allow for accurate calculations of the per-group normalization statistics (in our\nexperience this meant a group size greater than 256). To implement SSM-Transformer hybrid models, we combine our Mamba or Mamba-2 layers with the existing self-attention and MLP layers supported in Megatron-LM. These layers support all the previously mentioned parallelization strategies enabling us to immediately train hybrid models with tensor, sequence, and pipeline parallelism. ### 2.2 Training Data\n\nWe train the models discussed in this report on 1.1 T and 3.5 T token datasets. Both datasets are predecessors of the dataset used to train Nemotron-4 and are comprised of $70 \\%$ English, $15 \\%$ non-English, and $15 \\%$ code. For additional details, refer to the discussion included in the Nemotron- 4 technical report (Parmar et al. 2024). We use a vocabulary of 256 K tokens trained with SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson 2018). ### 2.3 Evaluation Tasks and Setup\n\nWe now discuss the evaluations used throughout the paper. Wherever possible, we use open-source LLM benchmark suites to ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible. We report results using a large number of common tasks:\n\n- Standard Short-Context Tasks: We use the open-source LM Evaluation Harness library (commit 94cc1850) (L. Gao et al. 2023) to evaluate the following 12 tasks (metric used for evaluation reported in parentheses): WinoGrande (accuracy) (Sakaguchi et al. 2021), PIQA (accuracy) (Bisk et al. 2020), HellaSwag (normalized accuracy) (Zellers et al. 2019), ARCEasy and ARC-Challenge (accuracy and normalized accuracy) (Clark et al. 2018), MMLU (accuracy) (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020), OpenBookQA (normalized accuracy) (Mihaylov et al. 2018), TruthFulQA (accuracy) (Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2021), PubMedQA (accuracy) (Jin et al. 2019), and RACE (accuracy) (Lai et al. 2017). Each of the proceeding tasks are evaluated by measuring the probability returned by the model for each possible answer choice. We also use the generation-based tasks Natural Questions (NQ) (exact match) (Lee, Chang, and Toutanova 2019) and SquadV2 (F1) (Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018). - Natural Long-Context Tasks: To evaluate long-context models, as above, we use three tasks from LM Evaluation Harness: NarrativeQA (F1) (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n#### 5.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

This aligns with the goal of enhancing the GatedMLP's ability to model long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Data-Controlled Gating**: The gating mechanisms in Hyena Operators are data-dependent, which can enhance the expressiveness of the GatedMLP by allowing dynamic adjustments based on input context. This complements the existing gating in GatedMLP.\n\n- **Compatibility with the Seed Design**: The integration can be designed to ensure that the modified GatedMLP outputs embeddings of the same shape and remains compatible with the hierarchical adaptive attention and dynamic normalization components.\n\n### Empirical Evidence Supporting Integration\n\n- **Performance Gains**: Studies like **Poli et al.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/56 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis suggests that the training sequence length should be carefully chosen according to the intended downstream use of the model. ### 6.2. Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

Consequently, developing Deep Learning (DL) sequence models capable of effectively managing long contexts is a critical objective. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), despite their current dominance in general DL tasks, still face challenges in processing long sequences. Specifically, their quadratic complexity in sequence length makes them computationally\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-01.jpg?height=453&width=780&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: Document Retrieval Over SQuAD. We present a novel decimation mechanism tailored for Mamba, enabling it to process sequences that are x 25 times longer than the ones seen during training. The purple line shows the training sequences length. Results are shown for DeciMamba-130M. demanding, restricting the ability to train them over long sequences and very large datasets. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made in order to tackle this challenge. The most significant advancements include efficient implementations that increase the model's context length during training (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023), and context-extension methods (Chen et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2023b) designed to effectively expand the context after training. However, recent studies suggest that long-range processing is still an unresolved problem (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). One promising approach in this domain is the development of attention-free networks with subquadratic complexity, which can be trained more effectively over long sequences. In a recent line of work (Gu et al., 2021b,a; Gupta et al., 2022), the family of state-space layers has been introduced. These layers can be seen as theoretically grounded linear RNNs that can be efficiently computed in parallel via convolutions, thanks to a closed-form formulation of their linear recurrent rule. A recent advancement by Gu and Dao (2023) presented Mamba, which builds on top of an expressive variant of SSMs called Selective State-Space Layers\n(S6). These layers match or exceed the performance of Transformers in several domains, such as NLP (Pi\u00f3ro et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), image classification (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), audio processing (Shams et al., 2024), genomic data (Schiff et al., 2024), and more. In this paper, we first explore the lengthgeneralization abilities of Mamba and identify that they are relatively limited. Although Mamba layers are theoretically capable of capturing global interactions at the layer level, through a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures, we show that the main barrier preventing Mamba from extrapolating is its implicit bias towards a limited effective receptive field (ERF), which is bounded primarily by the sequence length used during training. Secondly, based on the assumption that long-context data is usually sparse, we present DeciMamba, the first context-extension method specifically designed for S6. Our method relies on a dynamic data-dependent pooling method that utilizes a hidden filtering mechanism intrinsic to the Mamba layer. We leverage this mechanism to introduce a global compression operator, which expands Mamba's ERF by discarding un-important tokens before each S6 layer. Our method significantly increases the effective context length of Mamba by several orders of magnitude while requiring a smaller computational budget. Our main contributions encompass the following three aspects: (i) identify that Mamba has limited length-extrapolation capabilities, (ii) recognize via a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures that although Mamba can theoretically capture global interactions via the recurrent state, its limited ERF prevents significant lengthextrapolation. (iii) Building on this insight, we introduce DeciMamba, the first context-extension technique specifically designed for Mamba models. This approach leverages an existing filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer. As illustrated in Fig. 8, our method effectively enhances Mamba's length-extrapolation abilities by up to eightfold, and is applicable to real-world long-context NLP tasks, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, the scientific context for discussion of long-range models is described and the necessary terminology and symbols are provided. Such models evolve in two main directions: (i) first, by adapting transformers, the most dominant architec- ture today, to be more suitable for such tasks, or, alternatively, (ii) by developing architectures with sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length. Several modern examples include Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023a), Hawk (De et al., 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al., 2024), and Mamba, the latter being the focus of our paper. Mamba. Given an input sequence $U=$ $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{L}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ of length $L$ such that $u_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, a Mamba block with $d$ channels is built on top of the S6 layer via the following formula:\n$G=\\sigma(\\operatorname{Linear}(U)), \\quad X=\\operatorname{Conv1D}(\\operatorname{Linear}(U))$,\n\n$$\nY=S 6(X), \\quad O=Y \\otimes G\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ represents the gate branch, $\\otimes$ is elementwise multiplication, $\\sigma$ is the SILU activation, Linear and Conv1D are standard linear projection and 1-dimensional convolution layers. The S6 layer is based on a time-variant SSM, which can be elaborated by the following recurrent rule:\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\bar{A}_{t} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B}_{t} x_{t}, \\quad y_{t}=C_{t} h_{t}\n$$\n\nWhere $X=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{L}\\right)$ is the input sequence of a representative channel, $\\bar{A}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\bar{B}_{t} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$, and $C_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ are the system, input, and output discrete time-variant matrices, respectively. S6 conditions the discrete time-variant matrices based on the input as follows:\n$\\Delta_{t}=\\operatorname{Sft}\\left(S_{\\Delta} X_{t}\\right), \\quad B_{t}=S_{B} X_{t}, \\quad C_{t}=\\left(S_{C} X_{t}\\right)^{T}$\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{t}=\\exp \\left(A \\Delta_{t}\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}_{t}=B_{t} \\Delta_{t}\n$$\n\nsuch that $\\Delta_{t}$ is the discretization step, Sft represents the softplus function, and $S_{\\Delta}, S_{B}, S_{C}$ are linear projection layers. Ali et al. (2024) demonstrated that S6 layers, similar to attention models, can be interpreted as data-controlled linear operators. Specifically, the S6 layer computation can be represented using the following linear operator $\\alpha$, controlled by the input (via Eq. 4 and 5):\n\n$$\nY=\\alpha X, \\quad \\alpha_{i, j}=C_{i}\\left(\\prod_{k=j+1}^{i} \\bar{A}_{k}\\right) \\bar{B}_{j}\n$$\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{L}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}C_{1} \\bar{B}_{1} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ C_{2} \\bar{A}_{2} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{2} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\ C_{L} \\Pi_{k=2}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{L} \\Pi_{k=3}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & C_{L} \\bar{B}_{L}\\end{array}\\right] \\underset{(7)}{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{L}\\end{array}\\right]}$\nIn this formulation, each output $y_{i}$ is a weighted sum of all inputs, where the 'attention weights' of all inputs $x_{j}$, i.e., the set $\\left\\{\\alpha_{i, j}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{L}$, is data-driven. We utilize this perspective to further investigate the effective receptive field of Mamba layers. ## Context Extension \\& Length Extrapolation. Over the years, several methods have been proposed to enhance the effective context length of transformers and improve their ability to extrapolate over longer sequences. Traditionally, length generalization is closely related to positional encoding. Pioneering work in the domain, introduced by Press et al. (2021), demonstrates that models built on top of original sinusoidal, rotary ( Su et al., 2024), and T5 bias (Raffel et al., 2020) positional encoding have poor length generalization abilities. It proposes Alibi, which mitigates this issue by promoting locality through the incorporation of distance-based linear biases into the attention matrix. A counter-intuitive study was conducted by Kazemnejad et al. (2024), which shows that transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) exhibit better length extrapolation capabilities in downstream tasks. Two more promising approaches are the very recent CoPE (Golovneva et al., 2024), which utilizes context-aware positional encoding, and post-training positional interpolation (Peng et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). Alternatively, a recent direction involves architectural modifications to pre-trained models followed by short fine-tuning. Such works include LongLora (Chen et al., 2023b), which proposes shifted sparse attention, and Landmark Attention (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023), which applies attention in chunks and inserts global unique tokens into the input sequences between those chunks. Our method can be considered an application of this approach to Mamba models, rather than to traditional transformers.\n```\n\n#### 5. An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*R. Waleffe, Wonmin Byeon, Duncan Riach, Brandon Norick, V. Korthikanti, Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Ali Hatamizadeh, Sudhakar Singh, Deepak Narayanan, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Vartika Singh, Jared Casper, Jan Kautz, M. Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** While pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities or long-context reasoning, and it is found that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks evaluated.\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nThis confirms recent findings at smaller scales (Park et al. 2024). In particular, we highlight the difficulty pure SSM models face with the standard five-shot MMLU (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020) and two-shot Phonebook tasks. For the former, after training for 1.1 T tokens, both Mamba and Mamba-2 models produce nearly 15 points lower accuracy when compared to a Transformer model on this task. While the MMLU accuracy gap is partially addressed by training with more tokens (e.g., 3.5T tokens), SSM models still lag behind Transformer models for this common benchmark. We find that Phonebook and standard long-context benchmark tasks remain challenging for SSM models regardless of the number of training tokens. Based on the above findings, we study in detail the potential for hybrid SSM-Transformer models to overcome the challenges faced by pure SSM architectures while retaining (some of) their inferencetime benefits. Similar to Lieber et al. 2024, we focus on LLMs consisting of a mixture of Mamba-2, self-attention, and MLP layers. Our ablation experiments aiming to identify the best hybrid model architecture lead us to design an 8B-parameter Mamba-2-Hybrid with 24 Mamba-2 layers, 4 self-attention layers, and 28 MLP layers. The self-attention and MLP layers are evenly distributed throughout the model. Extensive evaluations of this architecture show that it matches or exceeds Transformers on common natural language evaluations. When training for 3.5 T tokens, a Mamba-2-Hybrid model exceeds a corresponding Transformer on all 12 short-context benchmarks we evaluated. On MMLU, the hybrid model reaches a five-shot accuracy 3.5 points higher than the Transformer. We also study long-context extensions of Mamba-2-Hybrid and the corresponding Transformer to support 16 K and 32 K context lengths. On 23 long-context evaluations, the 16 K and 32 K models closely match or exceed the Transformer baselines on average. Our results show that the hybrid models are particularly good at retrieving, tracking, and aggregating information over long contexts. We highlight three multi-document question answering tasks, however, which challenged the long-context hybrid models. We discuss potential reasons for these results and highlight areas of future work related to\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_b92355d6bd48fca7f050g-03.jpg?height=744&width=1491&top_left_y=190&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 1: Mamba and Mamba-2 blocks with tensor model parallel size two. Mamba requires two all-reduces per layer while Mamba-2 requires only one. More details can be found in Dao and Gu 2024. extending hybrid SSM-Transformer models to long sequence lengths. Finally we highlight that, due to our use of global attention without any explicit position encoding in these models, long-context Mamba-2-Hybrid models can generalize beyond their trained sequence length. This is in contrast with recent hybrid models that use windowed attention and exhibit accuracy degradation on contexts larger than the window size but less than the pretraining sequence length (De et al. 2024). We find that a Mamba-2-Hybrid extended to support 128 K contexts can perform the Phonebook lookup task perfectly even when the phone book contains more than 150 K tokens. We present our findings above to highlight the promise for larger-scale SSM-based models to provide faster, more efficient language model inference without compromising training efficiency or model accuracy compared to Transformers. We hope that by releasing these results, the community is further excited by the potential of Mamba-based LLMs. To help enable further adoption, we release the code used to train our Mamba, Mamba-2, and Mamba-2-Hybrid hybrid models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM library (https:// github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). We also release the model weights for our Mamba-2 8B and Mamba-2-Hybrid 8B on Hugging Face. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we discuss briefly our implementation of SSM layers in Megatron-LM and discuss the training data and evaluations used throughout this report. ### 2.1 Model Implementation\n\nTo support efficient large-scale training, we implement Mamba and Mamba-2 layers with support for tensor (Shoeybi et al. 2019), sequence (Korthikanti et al. 2022), and pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al. 2021) (only for Mamba-2). As described in Dao and Gu 2024, tensor-parallel support for Mamba layers requires two all-reduces per block compared to just one all-reduce for Transformer layers (Figure 1), leading to increased communication overheads for training larger-scale Mamba models. Mamba-2 tensor parallel support, on the other hand, requires only one all-reduce per layer, but requires the use of GroupNorm rather than LayerNorm for the internal block normalization (see Figure 1). We found that using GroupNorm lead to no difference in validation loss when compared to using full LayerNorm as long as the group size (the model hidden dimension divided by the number of groups) is sufficiently large to allow for accurate calculations of the per-group normalization statistics (in our\nexperience this meant a group size greater than 256). To implement SSM-Transformer hybrid models, we combine our Mamba or Mamba-2 layers with the existing self-attention and MLP layers supported in Megatron-LM. These layers support all the previously mentioned parallelization strategies enabling us to immediately train hybrid models with tensor, sequence, and pipeline parallelism. ### 2.2 Training Data\n\nWe train the models discussed in this report on 1.1 T and 3.5 T token datasets. Both datasets are predecessors of the dataset used to train Nemotron-4 and are comprised of $70 \\%$ English, $15 \\%$ non-English, and $15 \\%$ code. For additional details, refer to the discussion included in the Nemotron- 4 technical report (Parmar et al. 2024). We use a vocabulary of 256 K tokens trained with SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson 2018). ### 2.3 Evaluation Tasks and Setup\n\nWe now discuss the evaluations used throughout the paper. Wherever possible, we use open-source LLM benchmark suites to ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible. We report results using a large number of common tasks:\n\n- Standard Short-Context Tasks: We use the open-source LM Evaluation Harness library (commit 94cc1850) (L. Gao et al. 2023) to evaluate the following 12 tasks (metric used for evaluation reported in parentheses): WinoGrande (accuracy) (Sakaguchi et al. 2021), PIQA (accuracy) (Bisk et al. 2020), HellaSwag (normalized accuracy) (Zellers et al. 2019), ARCEasy and ARC-Challenge (accuracy and normalized accuracy) (Clark et al. 2018), MMLU (accuracy) (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020), OpenBookQA (normalized accuracy) (Mihaylov et al. 2018), TruthFulQA (accuracy) (Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2021), PubMedQA (accuracy) (Jin et al. 2019), and RACE (accuracy) (Lai et al. 2017). Each of the proceeding tasks are evaluated by measuring the probability returned by the model for each possible answer choice. We also use the generation-based tasks Natural Questions (NQ) (exact match) (Lee, Chang, and Toutanova 2019) and SquadV2 (F1) (Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018). - Natural Long-Context Tasks: To evaluate long-context models, as above, we use three tasks from LM Evaluation Harness: NarrativeQA (F1) (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates **Hyena Operators** and **State Space Models (SSMs)** into the **GatedMLP** component of Transformer architectures, aiming to enhance long-range dependency modeling, efficiency, and overall performance. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integration of Hyena Operators and SSMs\n\n- **Hyena Operators**: These operators can replace or augment MLP layers, capturing long-range dependencies through data-dependent gating and long convolutions. Studies like **Poli et al. (2023)** show that Hyena Operators can significantly shrink the quality gap with attention at scale, achieving similar perplexity and downstream performance with a smaller computational budget[5,.\n\n## Hybrid Models\n\n- **Griffin and Mamba-2-Hybrid**: These models combine gated linear recurrences with attention mechanisms and have been shown to outperform or match the performance of Transformers on various tasks. This indicates the potential benefits of integrating Hyena Operators into the GatedMLP.\n\n## Training and Stability\n\n- **Challenges**: Integrating Hyena Operators and SSMs can introduce training challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients. Techniques like proper initialization, gradient clipping, and adaptive learning rates can help ensure training stability.\n- **Mitigation Strategies**: Proper parameter initialization, gradient clipping, and normalization techniques are crucial for addressing these challenges. Adaptive learning rates and careful training dynamics can also help.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n- **Modification of GatedMLP**: Replace standard linear transformations and activation functions with Hyena Operator-based convolutions. Retain and enhance the gating mechanisms with data-dependent gating from Hyena Operators to improve expressiveness. Ensure the modified GatedMLP maintains output embedding dimensions and integrates seamlessly with hierarchical attention and dynamic normalization.\n- **Implementation Resources**: Investigate open-source implementations of Hyena Operators, such as those associated with the **Hyena Hierarchy** or **ProtHyena**, to guide practical integration. Utilize detailed algorithmic descriptions to understand the mathematical underpinnings and implementation considerations.\n\n## Empirical Evidence\n\n- **Performance Gains**: Studies demonstrate that models incorporating Hyena Operators can match or exceed Transformer performance with improved efficiency. For example, **ProtHyena**, a small decoder-only LM based on the Hyena operator, has shown improvements over similar-sized models.\n- **Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: Hyena Operators and hybrid models like Griffin and Mamba-2-Hybrid have been shown to effectively model long-range dependencies, which is a key goal for the modified GatedMLP.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Expressiveness and Efficiency\n- Hyena Operators provide a mechanism to capture long-range dependencies within the MLP component using subquadratic computations, aligning with the goal of enhancing the GatedMLP's ability to model long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Data-Controlled Gating\n- The gating mechanisms in Hyena Operators are data-dependent, which can enhance the expressiveness of the GatedMLP by allowing dynamic adjustments based on input context.\n\n### Compatibility with Seed Design\n- Ensure that the modified GatedMLP outputs embeddings of the same shape and remains compatible with the hierarchical adaptive attention and dynamic normalization components.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Finalize the Modification Decision**:\n   - Proceed with integrating Hyena Operators into the GatedMLP based on the accumulated information.\n2. **Develop Theoretical Justification**:\n   - Formulate the mathematical foundations of the modified GatedMLP, detailing how Hyena Operators are integrated and their expected benefits.\n3. **Design the Modified GAU**:\n   - Create a detailed design of the new GatedMLP, specifying the alterations to linear transformations, gating mechanisms, and activation functions.\n4. **Consider Training Strategies**:\n   - Plan for training techniques to mitigate potential instabilities, such as proper initialization, gradient clipping, and adaptive learning rates.\n5. **Prepare the Formal Proposal**:\n   - Organize the proposal into the required sections, including Motivation, Related Work, Problem Analysis, Design Plan, Implementation Guidelines, and Conclusion.\n\n### Useful References\n\n- **Poli et al.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective. As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using a simple modification that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented. TNL outperforms existing efficient language models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art large language models using conventional transformer architectures. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

By addressing the limitations of linear attention in varying sequence lengths without increasing memory consumption, this advancement democratizes access to state-of-the-art language models, potentially reducing the computational and environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems. Ethically, it underscores a move towards more sustainable AI practices, yet raises questions about the proliferation of powerful language models and their societal impacts, including concerns over privacy, misinformation, and the digital divide. ## References\n\nAlmazrouei, E., Alobeidli, H., Alshamsi, A., Cappelli, A., Cojocaru, R., Debbah, M., Goffinet, E., Heslow, D., Launay, J., Malartic, Q., et al.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

The evaluation revolves around 4 main tasks:\n\n- Associative recall: Each string is produced by concatenating key-value tuples from a different random dictionary. This test verifies whether a model is able to extract right value given a key as prompt, effectively applying a data-controlled shift (delay). - Majority voting and counting: Testing if a model can densely activate its data-controlled matrix i.e.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6994c3a61e16d3fc4e33g-18.jpg?height=44&width=1237&top_left_y=829&top_left_x=284)\n\n- ICL of linear functions: Verifying whether a model can perform ICL on real-valued inputs. Prompts are generated as $x_{1}, w^{k} x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} \\rightarrow w^{k} x_{n}$, where both $x_{k}$ and $w^{k} \\in R^{n_{o}}$ are sampled from a normal distribution. - Arithmetic: Basic capability check. For each task, we train models using the hyperparameters shown in Table A.1. We consider increasing settings of difficulty controlled by sequence length, spanning values $1024,2048,4098,8196,16392,32784,65568,131136$ and vocabulary sizes $10,20,30,40$. For ICL of functions, we vary instead the dimension $n_{o}$. Note that for associative recall on longer sequences, multiple copies of key-value tuples appear in the prompt. To see this, consider how likely it is to sample multiple copies of a particular key-value pair with a vocabulary size of 40 , in order to form a sequence of 100 k characters. Models capable of looking further back in the sequence effectively see more data, and can solve challenging versions of the in-context learning task. Increasing the vocabulary size has the increasing the average distance between instances of the same key-value pair in each prompt, highlighting performance gaps between different approaches.

Hyena operators are a recurrence of gating and implicitly parametrized long convolutions, can be evaluated efficiently in subquadratic time, and can learn in-context on very long sequences. On The Pile, deep stacks of Hyena operators constitute one of the first attention-free, convolutional architectures to match perplexity and downstream performance of Transformers with a significant reduction in training compute. Our promising results at the sub-billion parameter scale suggest that attention may not be all we need, and that simpler subquadratic designs such as Hyena, informed by a set of simple guiding principles and evaluation on mechanistic interpretability benchmarks, may form the basis for efficient large models. We are excited about what new capabilities Hyena opens up as we scale and optimize the inference speed of these models. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Avanika Narayan, Khaled Saab, Michael Zhang, Elliot Epstein and Sabri Eyuboglu for helpful discussion and feedback on earlier drafts, and Together Computer and Crusoe for providing the compute used to train models in this paper.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on statespaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-ofthe-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a $20 \\%$ reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2 K . Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8 K , and $100 \\times$ faster at sequence length 64 K . ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge Transformers have enabled a number of breakthrough advances in modeling language, vision, audio, biology and numerous other domains (Vaswani et al., 2017), (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), (Radford et al., 2022), (Cramer, 2021). Much of the success of Transformers, powered by the attention operator (Vaswani et al., 2017), relies on their scaling properties (Hoffmann et al., 2022) and the emergence of in-context learning (Garg et al., 2022), which allows them to generalize to unseen data and tasks given context as input. The Transformer block is a powerful tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its limitations. One of the most notable is the computational cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input sequence increases. Specifically, the cost scales quadratically with the length $L$ of the sequence, which places a strict limit on the amount of context that can be considered by the model. Breaking the quadratic barrier is a key step towards new possibilities for deep learning, such as using entire textbooks as context, generating long-form music or processing gigapixel scale images. Efforts to reduce the computational cost of attention in models primarily involve the use of linearized, low-rank, and sparse approximations (Child et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2022). These approaches introduce a trade-off between expressivity and speed, requiring hybridization with standard attention layers to reach Transformer quality (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). A growing amount of evidence suggests that attention mechanisms only utilize a small portion of their quadratic capabilities for language processing (Olsson et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c), leading us to question its role as the gold-standard operator for deep learning at scale. Specifically, we ask:\n\nAre there subquadratic operators that can match the quality of attention at scale? [^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6994c3a61e16d3fc4e33g-02.jpg?height=436&width=1661&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=229)\n\nFigure 1.1: The Hyena operator is defined as a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: an implicit long convolution $h$ (i.e. Hyena filters parameterized by a feed-forward network) and multiplicative elementwise gating of the (projected) input. The depth of the recurrence specifies the size of the operator. Hyena can equivalently be expressed as a multiplication with data-controlled (conditioned by the input u) diagonal matrices $D_{x}$ and Toeplitz matrices $S_{h}$. In addition, Hyena exhibits sublinear parameter scaling (in sequence length) and unrestricted context, similar to attention, while having lower time complexity. We obtain a positive answer based on a composition of efficient subquadratic primitives, such as elementwise multiplication (gating) and long convolutions i.e., convolutions with filter sizes as long as the input. We rely on a set of targeted reasoning tasks, grounded in recent work on mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Power et al., 2022; Olsson et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) such as recall and induction, to distill three properties of attention correlated with its performance and the quality gap with existing subquadratic approaches:\na. Data control: Attention implements an expressive data-controlled (Massaroli et al., 2020) linear operator ${ }^{1}$, encoding an entire family of linear functions in a single block. b. Sublinear parameter scaling: Parameter counts of attention layers are decoupled from sequence length, allowing Transformers to allocate more parameters elsewhere e.g., the feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) between attention layers. c. Unrestricted context: For a given input, attention has an unrestricted context i.e., it can approximate dependencies between any two inputs, without arbitrary restrictions such as locality (except in cases using masking such as autoregressive models). The Hyena hierarchy Guided by these findings, we introduce the Hyena hierarchy, an operator defined by a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: a long convolution and element-wise multiplicative gating (see Figure 1.1). A specified depth (i.e., number of steps) of the recurrence controls the size of the operator. For short recurrences, existing models are recovered as special cases (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). By mapping each step in the Hyena recurrence to its corresponding matrix form, we reveal Hyena operators to be equivalently defined as a decomposition of a data-controlled matrix i.e., a matrix whose entries are functions of the input. Furthermore, we show how Hyena operators can be evaluated efficiently without materializing the full matrix, by leveraging fast convolution algorithms (Selesnick and Burrus, 2017). Empirically, Hyena operators are able to significantly shrink the quality gap with attention at scale, reaching similar perplexity and downstream performance with a smaller computational budget (Section 4.2 ) and without hybridization of attention. Narrowing the capabilities gap The design of Hyena is motivated by a quality gap between standard dense attention and alternative subquadratic operators, which we identify by focusing on reasoning tasks correlated with language modeling performance at scale. We extend the suite of basic mechanistic interpretability benchmarks (induction and recall) with additional tasks that probe how quickly model performance degrades\n\n[^1]when task complexity increases (e.g. vocabulary size grows). In addition, we investigate the optimal parameterization of long convolutions in Hyena. In the most challenging settings with hundreds of thousands of tokens, our implicit parameterization scheme improves over other operators leveraging state spaces (Gu et al., 2021), frequency-domain parametrizations (Li et al., 2020), or standard convolutions by over $50 \\%$ accuracy. Scaling in language and vision Next, we aim to verify whether rankings in our reasoning benchmark suite are predictive of quality at scale. We test Hyena on autoregressive language modeling at the sub-billion parameter scale, setting a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile) and matching Transformer quality. On the The Pile at the 335M parameter scale, we match Transformer perplexity with a $20 \\%$ reduction in the total count of floating point operations (FLOPs). As an extension, we investigate the generality of Hyena operators by testing on large-scale image recognition, replacing attention in the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). In image classification, Hyena is able to match attention in accuracy when training on ImageNet-1k from scratch. Toward much longer context Finally, we benchmark the efficiency of Hyena on long sequences. We measure 5x speedups over dense self-attention at length $8192-2 \\mathrm{x}$ over highly optimized FlashAttention ${ }^{2}$ (Dao et al., 2022b) - and 100x speedup over FlashAttention at sequence lengths of 64 k , where standard attention implementation in PyTorch runs out of memory. ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nA discrete convolution is a function of two arguments: an input $u$ signal of length $L$ and a learnable filter $h$. The linear (aperiodic) convolution of a (possibly infinitely long) measurable ${ }^{3}$ filter $h$ with a length- $L$ input signal $u$ is defined as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=(h * u)_{t}=\\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} h_{t-n} u_{n}\n$$\n\nGenerally, $u_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ where $D$ is the width of the signal, or in deep learning parlance, the number of channels. Without loss of generality, we specialize our analysis to single input single output (SISO) layers, i.e. with $D=1$. The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) case, canonical in standard convolutional layers, follows directly. In this case, the input signal can be represented as a vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ and the convolution as a matrix-vector product between the input and the Toeplitz kernel matrix $\\mathrm{S}_{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ induced by the filter $h$ :\n\n$$\n(h * u)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nh_{0} & h_{-1} & \\cdots & h_{-L+1} \\\\\nh_{1} & h_{0} & \\cdots & h_{-L+2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nh_{L-1} & h_{L-2} & \\cdots & h_{0}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nu_{0} \\\\\nu_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_{L-1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n### 2.1 Explicit and Implicit Convolutions\n\nParametrizing and optimizing convolution filters $h_{t}$ is a standard procedure in deep learning and more broadly signal processing. The classical approach of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Fukushima and Miyake, 1982; LeCun et al., 1998; Ronneberger et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) is to optimize directly the values $h_{t}$ of the filter's response at $M$ prescribed steps, a parametrization we call explicit.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/63 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n\\(x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{N}, v=\\operatorname{Projection}(u)\\)\n    2. \\(h^{1}, \\ldots, h^{N}=\\) HyenaFilter \\(\\left(L, D_{e}\\right)\\)\n    for \\(n=1, \\ldots, N\\) do\n        3.

Our results show that implicit parametrizations scale more favorably in vocabulary size (number of possible values of tokens in the input) and length of the sequence. ## 4 Experiments\n\n### 4.1 Shrinking the gap on in-context learning\n\nWe begin by empirically motivating the Hyena design, including the choice of long convolution parametrization. We consider the suite of tasks described in Table 4.1. Our evaluation is grounded in recent work on mechanistic interpretability of Transformers (Elhage et al., 2021; Power et al., 2022; Olsson et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). Recently, associative recall, in particular, has been successfully used to guide the design of H3 (Dao et al., 2022c). We extend the suite of tasks from these works and include benchmarking more challenging versions of each task . For example, solving associative recall with a vocabulary size of only 10 reveals whether a model is structurally capable of performing recall. Testing on much longer sequences and larger vocabularies reveals additional gaps in performance that are otherwise hidden. How to parametrize long convolutions We compare the performance of the following long convolution parametrizations for $S^{1}$ and $S^{2}$ in an order 2 Hyena:\n\n- Conv1d: Explicit convolutions (regular convolution layers with fixed filter size). - FNO: Filters parametrized explicitly in the frequency-domain (Li et al., 2020). - H3: Implicit parametrization using state-space models (SSMs), in particular the standard S4 (Gu et al., 2021). - TransferFunc: Implicit parametrization via transfer functions, a classical system-theoretic generalization of $\\mathrm{SSMs}^{8}$\n- CKConv: Implicit parametrization using FFNs (Romero et al., 2021b).

The symbol $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is used to mark settings where the model does not fit in memory. | Sequence length | Hyena | FlashTransformer | Transformer | GSS | H3 | AFT | RWKV |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 30 k | 100.0 | 32.4 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 5.3 | 8.4 | 2.3 | 12.4 |\n| 64 k | 100.0 | 26.7 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 2.1 | 4.3 | 1.2 | 6.5 |\n| 131 k | 97.2 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0.1 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 2.3 |\n\n- Hyena: Combination of implicit parametrizations via FFNs (with exponential decay modulation as shown in Figure 3.1), and short explicit filters. All models have the same width and 2 layers. Figure 4.1 shows implicit approaches based on FFNs outperform other long convolutions, with the gap widening on longer sequences and larger vocabulary sizes. We train a different model on each setting of sequence length and vocabulary size. The ranking is correlated with the ability to decouple sequence length from parameter count (Hyena, CKConv, TransferFunc, H3) and expressivity (Hyena, CKConv). We observe similar trends on the other tasks. Pushing sequence length to the limit Next, we evaluate associative recall performance on extremely long sequences of length 131 k . To the best of our knowledge, these represent the first empirical display of attention-free in-context learning on sequences of this length. The gap between parametrization schemes widens as shown in Appendix A, with Hyena outperforming CKConv by 80 points. Comparing operators We repeat our associative recall experiment, this time benchmarking different 2 layer models rather than changing the convolution parametrization: an order 2 Hyena, GSS (Mehta et al., 2022), H3 (Dao et al., 2022c), AFT-conv (Zhai et al., 2021), RWKV (Peng, 2021), and a standard GPT (Brown et al., 2020) using FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022b). As shown in Table 4.2, Hyena is the only operator able to solve the task. Our results challenge the observation that only Transformers are capable of challenging in-context learning. Surprisingly, rankings of model performance at a fixed sequence length on The Pile are consistent with rankings on aggregate scores on our synthetics (Appendix C). Generality of Hyena operators and filters Hyena operators and filters can also applied successfully beyond language tasks. We experiment on sequential CIFAR, where pixels are flattened as a sequence, and use the same operator defined for language. We reach the accuracy of standard S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) with same model size ( $91 \\%$ ). In Section 4.5 and Appendix A, we discuss larger-scale image classification experiments with Hyena. ### 4.2 Language Modeling\n\nNext, we verify the scaling of Hyena on autoregressive language modeling. We evaluate the perplexity on WikiText103 (Table 4.3) and The Pile (Table 4.4). On the The Pile, we train different models for $5,10,15$ billion tokens (different runs), adjusting the learning rate scheduler. Hyena is the first attention-free, convolution architecture to match GPT quality with a $20 \\%{ }^{9}$ reduction in total FLOPs.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04081, 2024.

Towards A Unified View of Sparse Feed-Forward Network in Pretraining Large Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" \"Feed-Forward Network\" Transformer*\n\n*Leo Liu, Tim Dettmers, Xi Victoria Lin, Ves Stoyanov, Xian Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simpler selection method is found that selects blocks through their mean aggregated hidden states, achieving lower perplexity in language model pretraining compared to existing MoE architectures including Switch Transformer and HashLayer.\n\n**Abstract:** Large and sparse feed-forward layers (S-FFN) such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have proven effective in scaling up Transformers model size for \\textit{pretraining} large language models. By only activating part of the FFN parameters conditioning on input, S-FFN improves generalization performance while keeping training and inference costs (in FLOPs) fixed. In this work, we analyzed two major design choices of S-FFN: the memory block (a.k.a. expert) size and the memory block selection method under a general conceptual framework of sparse neural memory. Using this unified framework, we compare several S-FFN architectures for language modeling and provide insights into their relative efficacy and efficiency. We found a simpler selection method -- \\textbf{\\texttt{Avg-K}} that selects blocks through their mean aggregated hidden states, achieving lower perplexity in language model pretraining compared to existing MoE architectures including Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) and HashLayer (Roller et al., 2021).\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Build Predictions by Promoting Concepts in the Vocabulary Space\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" \"Feed-Forward Network\" Transformer*\n\n*Mor Geva, Avi Caciularu, Ke Wang, Yoav Goldberg*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reverse-engineering the operation of the feed-forward network layers, one of the building blocks of transformer models, shows that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are at the core of modern NLP, but their internal prediction construction process is opaque and largely not understood. In this work, we make a substantial step towards unveiling this underlying prediction process, by reverse-engineering the operation of the feed-forward network (FFN) layers, one of the building blocks of transformer models. We view the token representation as a changing distribution over the vocabulary, and the output from each FFN layer as an additive update to that distribution. Then, we analyze the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable. We then leverage these findings for controlling LM predictions, where we reduce the toxicity of GPT2 by almost 50%, and for improving computation efficiency with a simple early exit rule, saving 20% of computation on average.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 255  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 3. Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Are Key-Value Memories\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" \"Feed-Forward Network\" Transformer*\n\n*Mor Geva, R. Schuster, Jonathan Berant, Omer Levy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary.\n\n**Abstract:** Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model\u2019s parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. We show that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones. The values complement the keys\u2019 input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model\u2019s layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 566  (*Influential: 59*)\n\n#### 4. Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated MLP\" \"Implicit Convolution\" Language Model*\n\n*Yifan Peng, Siddharth Dalmia, Ian Lane, Shinji Watanabe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model.\n\n**Abstract:** Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. A Stacking Gated Neural Architecture for Implicit Discourse Relation Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated MLP\" \"Implicit Convolution\" Language Model*\n\n*Lianhui Qin, Zhisong Zhang, Zhao Hai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A stacking neural network model is proposed to solve the classi\ufb01cation problem in which a convolutional neural network is utilized for sentence modeling and a collaborative gated neural network (CGNN) is proposed for feature transformation.\n\n**Abstract:** Discourse parsing is considered as one of the most challenging natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Implicit discourse relation clas-si\ufb01cation is the bottleneck for discourse parsing. Without the guide of explicit discourse connectives, the relation of sentence pairs are very hard to be inferred. This paper proposes a stacking neural network model to solve the classi\ufb01cation problem in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized for sentence modeling and a collaborative gated neural network (CGNN) is proposed for feature transformation.

Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated MLP\" \"Implicit Convolution\" Language Model*\n\n*Yann Dauphin, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, David Grangier*\n\n**TL;DR:** A finite context approach through stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow parallelization over sequential tokens, is developed and is the first time a non-recurrent approach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale language tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-dominant approach to language modeling to date is based on recurrent neural networks. Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to capture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach through stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow parallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating mechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key architectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the WikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well as competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces the latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a recurrent baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first time a non-recurrent approach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 2181  (*Influential: 201*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" \"Feed-Forward Network\" Transformer*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large\nTransformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building\nblock of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in\nsequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing\nsubquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be\ncombined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in\ncapability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement\nfor attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long\nconvolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on\nsequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves\naccuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and\nother implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a\nnew state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language\nmodeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer\nquality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length\n2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence\nlength 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-21T18:29:25Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-19T20:08:39Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Scavenging Hyena: Distilling Transformers into Long Convolution Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" \"Feed-Forward Network\" Transformer*\n\n*Tokiniaina Raharison Ralambomihanta, Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Mohammad Sami Nur Islam, Wassim Jabbour, Laurence Liang*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by\narchitectures like GPT-4, has reshaped the landscape of natural language\nprocessing. This paper introduces a pioneering approach to address the\nefficiency concerns associated with LLM pre-training, proposing the use of\nknowledge distillation for cross-architecture transfer. Leveraging insights\nfrom the efficient Hyena mechanism, our method replaces attention heads in\ntransformer models by Hyena, offering a cost-effective alternative to\ntraditional pre-training while confronting the challenge of processing long\ncontextual information, inherent in quadratic attention mechanisms. Unlike\nconventional compression-focused methods, our technique not only enhances\ninference speed but also surpasses pre-training in terms of both accuracy and\nefficiency.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Machine Learning of Generic and User-Focused Summarization\n\n*Inderjeet Mani, Eric Bloedorn*\n\n**Abstract:** A key problem in text summarization is finding a salience function which\ndetermines what information in the source should be included in the summary.\nThis paper describes the use of machine learning on a training corpus of\ndocuments and their abstracts to discover salience functions which describe\nwhat combination of features is optimal for a given summarization task.

Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated MLP\" \"Implicit Convolution\" Language Model*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling.

DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation\n\n*Hongxia Yang, Quanzeng You, Zhengyu Chen, Xiaotian Han, Huaibo Huang, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Yuang Ai*\n\n**Abstract:** Image restoration (IR) in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive datasets. To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

However, producing highly spontaneous, human-like speech remains a challenge due to the scarcity of large, diverse, and spontaneous speech datasets. In response, we introduce Emilia, the first large-scale, multilingual, and diverse speech generation dataset. Emilia starts with over 101k hours of speech across six languages, covering a wide range of speaking styles to enable more natural and spontaneous speech generation. To facilitate the scale-up of Emilia, we also present Emilia-Pipe, the first open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to efficiently transform raw, in-the-wild speech data into high-quality training data with speech annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both Emilia and Emilia-Pipe.

Hyena operators are a recurrence of gating and implicitly parametrized long convolutions, can be evaluated efficiently in subquadratic time, and can learn in-context on very long sequences. On The Pile, deep stacks of Hyena operators constitute one of the first attention-free, convolutional architectures to match perplexity and downstream performance of Transformers with a significant reduction in training compute. Our promising results at the sub-billion parameter scale suggest that attention may not be all we need, and that simpler subquadratic designs such as Hyena, informed by a set of simple guiding principles and evaluation on mechanistic interpretability benchmarks, may form the basis for efficient large models. We are excited about what new capabilities Hyena opens up as we scale and optimize the inference speed of these models. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Avanika Narayan, Khaled Saab, Michael Zhang, Elliot Epstein and Sabri Eyuboglu for helpful discussion and feedback on earlier drafts, and Together Computer and Crusoe for providing the compute used to train models in this paper.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on statespaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-ofthe-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a $20 \\%$ reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2 K . Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8 K , and $100 \\times$ faster at sequence length 64 K . ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge Transformers have enabled a number of breakthrough advances in modeling language, vision, audio, biology and numerous other domains (Vaswani et al., 2017), (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), (Radford et al., 2022), (Cramer, 2021). Much of the success of Transformers, powered by the attention operator (Vaswani et al., 2017), relies on their scaling properties (Hoffmann et al., 2022) and the emergence of in-context learning (Garg et al., 2022), which allows them to generalize to unseen data and tasks given context as input. The Transformer block is a powerful tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its limitations. One of the most notable is the computational cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input sequence increases. Specifically, the cost scales quadratically with the length $L$ of the sequence, which places a strict limit on the amount of context that can be considered by the model. Breaking the quadratic barrier is a key step towards new possibilities for deep learning, such as using entire textbooks as context, generating long-form music or processing gigapixel scale images. Efforts to reduce the computational cost of attention in models primarily involve the use of linearized, low-rank, and sparse approximations (Child et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2022). These approaches introduce a trade-off between expressivity and speed, requiring hybridization with standard attention layers to reach Transformer quality (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). A growing amount of evidence suggests that attention mechanisms only utilize a small portion of their quadratic capabilities for language processing (Olsson et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c), leading us to question its role as the gold-standard operator for deep learning at scale. Specifically, we ask:\n\nAre there subquadratic operators that can match the quality of attention at scale? [^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6994c3a61e16d3fc4e33g-02.jpg?height=436&width=1661&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=229)\n\nFigure 1.1: The Hyena operator is defined as a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: an implicit long convolution $h$ (i.e. Hyena filters parameterized by a feed-forward network) and multiplicative elementwise gating of the (projected) input. The depth of the recurrence specifies the size of the operator. Hyena can equivalently be expressed as a multiplication with data-controlled (conditioned by the input u) diagonal matrices $D_{x}$ and Toeplitz matrices $S_{h}$. In addition, Hyena exhibits sublinear parameter scaling (in sequence length) and unrestricted context, similar to attention, while having lower time complexity. We obtain a positive answer based on a composition of efficient subquadratic primitives, such as elementwise multiplication (gating) and long convolutions i.e., convolutions with filter sizes as long as the input. We rely on a set of targeted reasoning tasks, grounded in recent work on mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Power et al., 2022; Olsson et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) such as recall and induction, to distill three properties of attention correlated with its performance and the quality gap with existing subquadratic approaches:\na. Data control: Attention implements an expressive data-controlled (Massaroli et al., 2020) linear operator ${ }^{1}$, encoding an entire family of linear functions in a single block. b. Sublinear parameter scaling: Parameter counts of attention layers are decoupled from sequence length, allowing Transformers to allocate more parameters elsewhere e.g., the feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) between attention layers. c. Unrestricted context: For a given input, attention has an unrestricted context i.e., it can approximate dependencies between any two inputs, without arbitrary restrictions such as locality (except in cases using masking such as autoregressive models). The Hyena hierarchy Guided by these findings, we introduce the Hyena hierarchy, an operator defined by a recurrence of two efficient subquadratic primitives: a long convolution and element-wise multiplicative gating (see Figure 1.1). A specified depth (i.e., number of steps) of the recurrence controls the size of the operator. For short recurrences, existing models are recovered as special cases (Mehta et al., 2022; Dao et al., 2022c). By mapping each step in the Hyena recurrence to its corresponding matrix form, we reveal Hyena operators to be equivalently defined as a decomposition of a data-controlled matrix i.e., a matrix whose entries are functions of the input. Furthermore, we show how Hyena operators can be evaluated efficiently without materializing the full matrix, by leveraging fast convolution algorithms (Selesnick and Burrus, 2017). Empirically, Hyena operators are able to significantly shrink the quality gap with attention at scale, reaching similar perplexity and downstream performance with a smaller computational budget (Section 4.2 ) and without hybridization of attention. Narrowing the capabilities gap The design of Hyena is motivated by a quality gap between standard dense attention and alternative subquadratic operators, which we identify by focusing on reasoning tasks correlated with language modeling performance at scale. We extend the suite of basic mechanistic interpretability benchmarks (induction and recall) with additional tasks that probe how quickly model performance degrades\n\n[^1]when task complexity increases (e.g. vocabulary size grows). In addition, we investigate the optimal parameterization of long convolutions in Hyena. In the most challenging settings with hundreds of thousands of tokens, our implicit parameterization scheme improves over other operators leveraging state spaces (Gu et al., 2021), frequency-domain parametrizations (Li et al., 2020), or standard convolutions by over $50 \\%$ accuracy. Scaling in language and vision Next, we aim to verify whether rankings in our reasoning benchmark suite are predictive of quality at scale. We test Hyena on autoregressive language modeling at the sub-billion parameter scale, setting a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile) and matching Transformer quality. On the The Pile at the 335M parameter scale, we match Transformer perplexity with a $20 \\%$ reduction in the total count of floating point operations (FLOPs). As an extension, we investigate the generality of Hyena operators by testing on large-scale image recognition, replacing attention in the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). In image classification, Hyena is able to match attention in accuracy when training on ImageNet-1k from scratch. Toward much longer context Finally, we benchmark the efficiency of Hyena on long sequences. We measure 5x speedups over dense self-attention at length $8192-2 \\mathrm{x}$ over highly optimized FlashAttention ${ }^{2}$ (Dao et al., 2022b) - and 100x speedup over FlashAttention at sequence lengths of 64 k , where standard attention implementation in PyTorch runs out of memory. ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nA discrete convolution is a function of two arguments: an input $u$ signal of length $L$ and a learnable filter $h$. The linear (aperiodic) convolution of a (possibly infinitely long) measurable ${ }^{3}$ filter $h$ with a length- $L$ input signal $u$ is defined as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=(h * u)_{t}=\\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} h_{t-n} u_{n}\n$$\n\nGenerally, $u_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ where $D$ is the width of the signal, or in deep learning parlance, the number of channels. Without loss of generality, we specialize our analysis to single input single output (SISO) layers, i.e. with $D=1$. The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) case, canonical in standard convolutional layers, follows directly. In this case, the input signal can be represented as a vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ and the convolution as a matrix-vector product between the input and the Toeplitz kernel matrix $\\mathrm{S}_{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ induced by the filter $h$ :\n\n$$\n(h * u)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nh_{0} & h_{-1} & \\cdots & h_{-L+1} \\\\\nh_{1} & h_{0} & \\cdots & h_{-L+2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nh_{L-1} & h_{L-2} & \\cdots & h_{0}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nu_{0} \\\\\nu_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_{L-1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n### 2.1 Explicit and Implicit Convolutions\n\nParametrizing and optimizing convolution filters $h_{t}$ is a standard procedure in deep learning and more broadly signal processing. The classical approach of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Fukushima and Miyake, 1982; LeCun et al., 1998; Ronneberger et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) is to optimize directly the values $h_{t}$ of the filter's response at $M$ prescribed steps, a parametrization we call explicit.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/63 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n\\(x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{N}, v=\\operatorname{Projection}(u)\\)\n    2. \\(h^{1}, \\ldots, h^{N}=\\) HyenaFilter \\(\\left(L, D_{e}\\right)\\)\n    for \\(n=1, \\ldots, N\\) do\n        3.

Our results show that implicit parametrizations scale more favorably in vocabulary size (number of possible values of tokens in the input) and length of the sequence. ## 4 Experiments\n\n### 4.1 Shrinking the gap on in-context learning\n\nWe begin by empirically motivating the Hyena design, including the choice of long convolution parametrization. We consider the suite of tasks described in Table 4.1. Our evaluation is grounded in recent work on mechanistic interpretability of Transformers (Elhage et al., 2021; Power et al., 2022; Olsson et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). Recently, associative recall, in particular, has been successfully used to guide the design of H3 (Dao et al., 2022c). We extend the suite of tasks from these works and include benchmarking more challenging versions of each task . For example, solving associative recall with a vocabulary size of only 10 reveals whether a model is structurally capable of performing recall. Testing on much longer sequences and larger vocabularies reveals additional gaps in performance that are otherwise hidden. How to parametrize long convolutions We compare the performance of the following long convolution parametrizations for $S^{1}$ and $S^{2}$ in an order 2 Hyena:\n\n- Conv1d: Explicit convolutions (regular convolution layers with fixed filter size). - FNO: Filters parametrized explicitly in the frequency-domain (Li et al., 2020). - H3: Implicit parametrization using state-space models (SSMs), in particular the standard S4 (Gu et al., 2021). - TransferFunc: Implicit parametrization via transfer functions, a classical system-theoretic generalization of $\\mathrm{SSMs}^{8}$\n- CKConv: Implicit parametrization using FFNs (Romero et al., 2021b). [^6]Table 4.1: A selection of our mechanistic design benchmarks. | Task | Prompt | Target |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Associative Recall | $\\mathrm{a}, 1, \\mathrm{~b}, \\mathrm{e}, 3, \\mathrm{f}, \\mathrm{b}$ | e |\n| Majority | $\\mathrm{a}, \\mathrm{g}, \\mathrm{g}, \\mathrm{g}, \\mathrm{e}, \\mathrm{f}, \\mathrm{g}$ | g |\n| Counting | $\\mathrm{a}, \\mathrm{b}, \\mathrm{b}, \\mathrm{b}, \\mathrm{a}, \\mathrm{c}, \\mathrm{b}$ | 4 |\n| ICL of Functions | $x_{0}, f\\left(x_{0}\\right), \\ldots x_{n}$ | $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ |\n| Arithmetic | $1,3,5,+, 6,8,3$ | $8,1,8$ |\n\nTable 4.2: Test accuracy (\\%) for associative recall on longer sequences, vocabulary size 30 . The symbol $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is used to mark settings where the model does not fit in memory. | Sequence length | Hyena | FlashTransformer | Transformer | GSS | H3 | AFT | RWKV |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 30 k | 100.0 | 32.4 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 5.3 | 8.4 | 2.3 | 12.4 |\n| 64 k | 100.0 | 26.7 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 2.1 | 4.3 | 1.2 | 6.5 |\n| 131 k | 97.2 | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0.1 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 2.3 |\n\n- Hyena: Combination of implicit parametrizations via FFNs (with exponential decay modulation as shown in Figure 3.1), and short explicit filters. All models have the same width and 2 layers. Figure 4.1 shows implicit approaches based on FFNs outperform other long convolutions, with the gap widening on longer sequences and larger vocabulary sizes. We train a different model on each setting of sequence length and vocabulary size. The ranking is correlated with the ability to decouple sequence length from parameter count (Hyena, CKConv, TransferFunc, H3) and expressivity (Hyena, CKConv). We observe similar trends on the other tasks. Pushing sequence length to the limit Next, we evaluate associative recall performance on extremely long sequences of length 131 k . To the best of our knowledge, these represent the first empirical display of attention-free in-context learning on sequences of this length. The gap between parametrization schemes widens as shown in Appendix A, with Hyena outperforming CKConv by 80 points. Comparing operators We repeat our associative recall experiment, this time benchmarking different 2 layer models rather than changing the convolution parametrization: an order 2 Hyena, GSS (Mehta et al., 2022), H3 (Dao et al., 2022c), AFT-conv (Zhai et al., 2021), RWKV (Peng, 2021), and a standard GPT (Brown et al., 2020) using FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022b). As shown in Table 4.2, Hyena is the only operator able to solve the task. Our results challenge the observation that only Transformers are capable of challenging in-context learning. Surprisingly, rankings of model performance at a fixed sequence length on The Pile are consistent with rankings on aggregate scores on our synthetics (Appendix C). Generality of Hyena operators and filters Hyena operators and filters can also applied successfully beyond language tasks. We experiment on sequential CIFAR, where pixels are flattened as a sequence, and use the same operator defined for language. We reach the accuracy of standard S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) with same model size ( $91 \\%$ ). In Section 4.5 and Appendix A, we discuss larger-scale image classification experiments with Hyena. ### 4.2 Language Modeling\n\nNext, we verify the scaling of Hyena on autoregressive language modeling. We evaluate the perplexity on WikiText103 (Table 4.3) and The Pile (Table 4.4). On the The Pile, we train different models for $5,10,15$ billion tokens (different runs), adjusting the learning rate scheduler. Hyena is the first attention-free, convolution architecture to match GPT quality with a $20 \\%{ }^{9}$ reduction in total FLOPs.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 60/63 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1710.09412, 2017.

The evaluation revolves around 4 main tasks:\n\n- Associative recall: Each string is produced by concatenating key-value tuples from a different random dictionary. This test verifies whether a model is able to extract right value given a key as prompt, effectively applying a data-controlled shift (delay). - Majority voting and counting: Testing if a model can densely activate its data-controlled matrix i.e.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6994c3a61e16d3fc4e33g-18.jpg?height=44&width=1237&top_left_y=829&top_left_x=284)\n\n- ICL of linear functions: Verifying whether a model can perform ICL on real-valued inputs. Prompts are generated as $x_{1}, w^{k} x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} \\rightarrow w^{k} x_{n}$, where both $x_{k}$ and $w^{k} \\in R^{n_{o}}$ are sampled from a normal distribution. - Arithmetic: Basic capability check. For each task, we train models using the hyperparameters shown in Table A.1. We consider increasing settings of difficulty controlled by sequence length, spanning values $1024,2048,4098,8196,16392,32784,65568,131136$ and vocabulary sizes $10,20,30,40$. For ICL of functions, we vary instead the dimension $n_{o}$. Note that for associative recall on longer sequences, multiple copies of key-value tuples appear in the prompt. To see this, consider how likely it is to sample multiple copies of a particular key-value pair with a vocabulary size of 40 , in order to form a sequence of 100 k characters.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Parameter-Efficient Domain Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources for Biomedical Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" integration \"Feed-Forward Network\"*\n\n*Qiuhao Lu, D. Dou, Thien Huu Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an architecture to integrate domain knowledge from diverse sources into PLMs in a parameter-ef\ufb01cient way and proposes to encode domain knowledge via adapters, which are small bottleneck feed-forward networks inserted between intermediate transformer layers in PLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Domain-speci\ufb01c pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success over various downstream tasks in different domains. However, existing domain-speci\ufb01c PLMs mostly rely on self-supervised learning over large amounts of domain text, without explicitly integrating domain-speci\ufb01c knowledge, which can be essential in many domains. Moreover, in knowledge-sensitive ar-eas such as the biomedical domain, knowledge is stored in multiple sources and formats, and existing biomedical PLMs either neglect them or utilize them in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce an architecture to integrate domain knowledge from diverse sources into PLMs in a parameter-ef\ufb01cient way. More speci\ufb01cally, we propose to encode domain knowledge via adapters , which are small bottleneck feed-forward networks inserted between intermediate transformer layers in PLMs. These knowledge adapters are pre-trained for individual domain knowledge sources and integrated via an attention-based knowledge controller to enrich PLMs. Taking the biomedical domain as a case study, we explore three knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters for PLMs based on the UMLS Metathesaurus graph, the Wikipedia articles for diseases, and the semantic grouping information for biomedical concepts. Extensive experiments on different biomedical NLP tasks and datasets demonstrate the bene\ufb01ts of the proposed architecture and the knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters across multiple PLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. PAC-FNO: Parallel-Structured All-Component Fourier Neural Operators for Recognizing Low-Quality Images\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" integration \"Feed-Forward Network\"*\n\n*Jinsung Jeon, Hyundong Jin, Jonghyun Choi, Sanghyun Hong, Dongeun Lee, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural network model, parallel-structured and all-component Fourier neural operator (PAC-FNO), that operates in the frequency domain, allowing it to handle images of varying resolutions within a single model, and is ready to work with existing image recognition models.\n\n**Abstract:** A standard practice in developing image recognition models is to train a model on a specific image resolution and then deploy it. However, in real-world inference, models often encounter images different from the training sets in resolution and/or subject to natural variations such as weather changes, noise types and compression artifacts. While traditional solutions involve training multiple models for different resolutions or input variations, these methods are computationally expensive and thus do not scale in practice. To this end, we propose a novel neural network model, parallel-structured and all-component Fourier neural operator (PAC-FNO), that addresses the problem. Unlike conventional feed-forward neural networks, PAC-FNO operates in the frequency domain, allowing it to handle images of varying resolutions within a single model. We also propose a two-stage algorithm for training PAC-FNO with a minimal modification to the original, downstream model. Moreover, the proposed PAC-FNO is ready to work with existing image recognition models. Extensively evaluating methods with seven image recognition benchmarks, we show that the proposed PAC-FNO improves the performance of existing baseline models on images with various resolutions by up to 77.1% and various types of natural variations in the images at inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Spectral evolution and invariance in linear-width neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" integration \"Feed-Forward Network\"*\n\n*Zhichao Wang, A. Engel, A. Sarwate, Ioana Dumitriu, Tony Chiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that monitoring the evolution of the spectra during training is an important step toward understanding the training dynamics and feature learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the spectral properties of linear-width feed-forward neural networks, where the sample size is asymptotically proportional to network width. Empirically, we show that the weight spectra in this high dimensional regime are invariant when trained by gradient descent for small constant learning rates and the changes in both operator and Frobenius norm are $\\Theta(1)$ in the limit. This implies the bulk spectra for both the conjugate and neural tangent kernels are also invariant. We demonstrate similar characteristics for models trained with mini-batch (stochastic) gradient descent with small learning rates and provide a theoretical justification for this special scenario. When the learning rate is large, we show empirically that an outlier emerges with its corresponding eigenvector aligned to the training data structure. We also show that after adaptive gradient training, where we have a lower test error and feature learning emerges, both the weight and kernel matrices exhibit heavy tail behavior. Different spectral properties such as invariant bulk, spike, and heavy-tailed distribution correlate to how far the kernels deviate from initialization. To understand this phenomenon better, we focus on a toy model, a two-layer network on synthetic data, which exhibits different spectral properties for different training strategies. Analogous phenomena also appear when we train conventional neural networks with real-world data. Our results show that monitoring the evolution of the spectra during training is an important step toward understanding the training dynamics and feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. ViTAE: Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Intrinsic Inductive Bias\n\n*From Search Query: \"Implicit Convolution\" GatedMLP Transformer*\n\n*Yufei Xu, Qiming Zhang, Jing Zhang, D. Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments on ImageNet as well as downstream tasks prove the superiority of ViTAE over the baseline transformer and concurrent works, which has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision tasks owing to their strong capability in modeling long-range dependency using the self-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, vision transformers treat an image as 1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance. Alternatively, they require large-scale training data and longer training schedules to learn the IB implicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, ie, ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and is able to learn robust feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block in parallel to the multi-head self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively. Experiments on ImageNet as well as downstream tasks prove the superiority of ViTAE over the baseline transformer and concurrent works.

Improved Transformer for High-Resolution GANs\n\n*From Search Query: \"Implicit Convolution\" GatedMLP Transformer*\n\n*Long Zhao, Zizhao Zhang, Ting Chen, Dimitris N. Metaxas, Han Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed HiT is an important milestone for generators in GANs which are completely free of convolutions and has a nearly linear computational complexity with respect to the image size and thus directly scales to synthesizing high definition images.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based models, exemplified by the Transformer, can effectively model long range dependency, but suffer from the quadratic complexity of self-attention operation, making them difficult to be adopted for high-resolution image generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we introduce two key ingredients to Transformer to address this challenge. First, in low-resolution stages of the generative process, standard global self-attention is replaced with the proposed multi-axis blocked self-attention which allows efficient mixing of local and global attention. Second, in high-resolution stages, we drop self-attention while only keeping multi-layer perceptrons reminiscent of the implicit neural function. To further improve the performance, we introduce an additional self-modulation component based on cross-attention. The resulting model, denoted as HiT, has a nearly linear computational complexity with respect to the image size and thus directly scales to synthesizing high definition images. We show in the experiments that the proposed HiT achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 30.83 and 2.95 on unconditional ImageNet $128 \\times 128$ and FFHQ $256 \\times 256$, respectively, with a reasonable throughput. We believe the proposed HiT is an important milestone for generators in GANs which are completely free of convolutions.

Blending Anti-Aliasing into Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Implicit Convolution\" GatedMLP Transformer*\n\n*Shengju Qian, Hao Shao, Yi Zhu, Mu Li, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work analyzes the uncharted problem of aliasing in vision transformer and proposes a plug-and-play Aliasing-Reduction Module(ARM) to alleviate the issue and investigates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method across multiple tasks and various vision transformer families.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architectures, based on self-attention mechanism and convolution-free design, recently found superior performance and booming applications in computer vision. However, the discontinuous patch-wise tokenization process implicitly introduces jagged artifacts into attention maps, arising the traditional problem of aliasing for vision transformers. Aliasing effect occurs when discrete patterns are used to produce high frequency or continuous information, resulting in the indistinguishable distortions. Recent researches have found that modern convolution networks still suffer from this phenomenon. In this work, we analyze the uncharted problem of aliasing in vision transformer and explore to incorporate anti-aliasing properties. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Aliasing-Reduction Module(ARM) to alleviate the aforementioned issue. We investigate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method across multiple tasks and various vision transformer families. This lightweight design consistently attains a clear boost over several famous structures.

Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" Gated MLP Language Model*\n\n*Yifan Peng, Siddharth Dalmia, Ian Lane, Shinji Watanabe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model.\n\n**Abstract:** Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 8. Interpreting and Improving Large Language Models in Arithmetic Calculation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hyena Operator\" Gated MLP Language Model*\n\n*Wei Zhang, Chaoqun Wan, Yonggang Zhang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work serves as a preliminary exploration into the arithmetic calculation abilities inherent in LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate mathematical tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across numerous applications and have shown an emergent ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical computations. However, even for the simplest arithmetic calculations, the intrinsic mechanisms behind LLMs remain mysterious, making it challenging to ensure reliability. In this work, we delve into uncovering a specific mechanism by which LLMs execute calculations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that LLMs frequently involve a small fraction (<5%) of attention heads, which play a pivotal role in focusing on operands and operators during calculation processes. Subsequently, the information from these operands is processed through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), progressively leading to the final solution. These pivotal heads/MLPs, though identified on a specific dataset, exhibit transferability across different datasets and even distinct tasks. This insight prompted us to investigate the potential benefits of selectively fine-tuning these essential heads/MLPs to boost the LLMs' computational performance. We empirically find that such precise tuning can yield notable enhancements on mathematical prowess, without compromising the performance on non-mathematical tasks. Our work serves as a preliminary exploration into the arithmetic calculation abilities inherent in LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate mathematical tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large\nTransformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building\nblock of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in\nsequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, unlike other\nstructured representations that emphasize the modularity of the problem --\ne.g., factor graphs -- neural networks are usually monolithic mappings from\ninputs to outputs, with a fixed computation order.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nundirected neural architectures, both unstructured and structured, on a range\nof tasks: tree-constrained dependency parsing, convolutional image\nclassification, and sequence completion with attention. By varying the\ncomputation order, we show how a single UNN can be used both as a classifier\nand a prototype generator, and how it can fill in missing parts of an input\nsequence, making them a promising field for further research.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-08T10:06:51Z  (*Updated: 2022-06-17T09:29:33Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation\n\n*Hongxia Yang, Quanzeng You, Zhengyu Chen, Xiaotian Han, Huaibo Huang, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Yuang Ai*\n\n**Abstract:** Image restoration (IR) in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive datasets. To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

This is because Hyena Operators utilize implicit convolutions that can efficiently model temporal patterns over long sequences.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: The use of implicit convolutions in Hyena Operators can be computationally efficient, especially for long sequences, which could enhance the overall efficiency of the model without significantly increasing complexity.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- **Training Stability**: Introducing Hyena Operators may introduce training instabilities. Techniques such as careful initialization, layer normalization, dropout, and gradient clipping could be essential to ensure stable training.\n- **Compatibility with Existing Architecture**: Ensuring that the modified GatedMLP maintains the expected input-output dimensions and data flow is crucial to avoid disrupting the model's functionality.

However, they often struggle with efficiently capturing long-range dependencies due to limitations in their feed-forward network (FFN) components, particularly within the GatedMLP units. The standard GatedMLP may not fully exploit temporal information, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks requiring understanding of long-distance relationships.\n\nRecent advancements in state space models (SSMs) and novel operators like Hyena Operators have shown promise in modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. By integrating Hyena Operators into the GatedMLP, we can enhance the model's ability to capture temporal patterns within the feed-forward network, leading to improved performance and efficiency.\n\nThe motivation behind HyenaGated-AttnGPT is to augment the GatedMLP with Hyena Operators to capture long-range dependencies within the FFN, thereby enhancing the overall capacity of the language model without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Hyena Operators\n\nPoli et al. (2023) introduced Hyena Operators as a subquadratic alternative to attention mechanisms, capable of modeling long sequences efficiently through implicit convolutions parameterized by data-dependent filters. Hyena Operators have demonstrated effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and can act as a drop-in replacement for attention or MLP layers.\n\n### State Space Models (SSMs)\n\nState space models have been successfully integrated into neural networks to model sequences with long-term dependencies. Gu et al. (2023) proposed Mamba, an architecture leveraging SSMs to achieve Transformer-level performance with reduced computational resources.\n\n### Gated Linear Units (GLUs)\n\nShazeer (2020) explored GLUs and their variants within Transformer architectures, showing that gating mechanisms improve information flow and model expressiveness.\n\n### Hybrid Models\n\nRecent works like Griffin (De et al., 2024) combine gated linear recurrences with attention mechanisms, outperforming traditional Transformers on language modeling tasks. These findings suggest that integrating state space mechanisms into existing architectures can yield significant performance gains.\n\n### Influence on Design Choices\n\nThese studies highlight the potential of integrating Hyena Operators and SSMs into the FFN component of Transformers. They inform the design choice to modify the GatedMLP by incorporating Hyena Operators, aiming to improve long-range dependency modeling within the feed-forward network while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Challenges\n\n1. **Limited Long-Range Dependency Modeling in GatedMLP**: The standard GatedMLP may not effectively capture long-range dependencies within the feed-forward network, limiting the model's ability to understand complex temporal patterns.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Enhancing the GatedMLP should not significantly increase computational complexity or hinder the scalability of the model.\n\n3. **Integration with Existing Architecture**: Modifications to the GatedMLP must be compatible with the hierarchical adaptive attention and dynamic normalization components of HieraNorm-AttnGPT.\n\n### Core Philosophy\n\nThe core idea is to integrate Hyena Operators into the GatedMLP to enhance its capacity for modeling long-range dependencies within the feed-forward network. Hyena Operators leverage state space models and data-controlled gating to capture temporal patterns efficiently. By embedding these operators into the GatedMLP, we aim to improve expressiveness and efficiency without substantially increasing computational cost.\n\n### Mathematical Justifications\n\n#### Hyena Operator Mechanism\n\nHyena Operators perform implicit long convolution operations defined as:\n\n\\[\ny(t) = \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{L} \\phi(t, \\tau) \\cdot x(\\tau)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( y(t) \\) is the output at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( x(\\tau) \\) is the input at time \\( \\tau \\),\n- \\( \\phi(t, \\tau) \\) is a data-dependent filter function parameterized by the input.\n\nThe filter \\( \\phi(t, \\tau) \\) captures the long-range dependencies by allowing interactions between distant time steps.\n\n#### Integration into GatedMLP\n\nThe standard GatedMLP performs computations as:\n\n\\[\nY = \\sigma(X W_1 + b_1) \\odot (X W_2 + b_2)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the input,\n- \\( W_1, W_2 \\) are weight matrices,\n- \\( b_1, b_2 \\) are biases,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is an activation function (e.g., SiLU),\n- \\( \\odot \\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\nBy integrating the Hyena Operator, the modified GatedMLP becomes:\n\n\\[\nY = \\sigma(\\text{Hyena}(X; \\theta)) \\odot (X W + b)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( \\text{Hyena}(X; \\theta) \\) denotes the Hyena Operator applied to \\( X \\) with parameters \\( \\theta \\),\n- \\( \\theta \\) includes parameters for the implicit convolution and gating mechanisms.\n\nThis modification allows the GatedMLP to capture long-range dependencies through the Hyena Operator while preserving the gating structure.\n\n#### Expected Improvements\n\n- **Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: The implicit convolution in Hyena Operators enables the capture of dependencies across long sequences within the MLP.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Hyena Operators have subquadratic complexity and can be efficiently implemented using FFTs or other efficient convolution algorithms.\n- **Expressiveness**: Data-controlled gating enhances the model's ability to adapt based on input context.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\n- **Increased Implementation Complexity**: Integrating Hyena Operators adds complexity to the GatedMLP, requiring careful implementation.\n- **Training Stability**: New components may introduce training instabilities that need to be addressed through proper initialization and training techniques.\n- **Computational Overhead**: Long convolutions may introduce additional computational overhead, but this is mitigated by efficient algorithms.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nGatedMLP\n```\n\n### Modifications and New Structures\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe plan is to replace the standard feed-forward operations in the GatedMLP with Hyena Operator-based convolutions, enhancing the MLP's ability to model long-range dependencies. The gating mechanisms will be retained and enhanced with data-dependent gating from Hyena Operators.\n\n#### Detailed Descriptions\n\n##### Modified GatedMLP with Hyena Operators\n\n1. **Input Projection**:\n\n   -
