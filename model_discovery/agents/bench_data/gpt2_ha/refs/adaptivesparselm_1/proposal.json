To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code ${ }^{1}$ and pre-trained model checkpoints ${ }^{2}$ are publicly available. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Attention Mechanism\n\nSuppose the input to the layer is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the embedding dimension, then the attention mechanism outputs\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$. Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. To facilitate modeling discrete data, the model in Eq. 2 can be discretized (using the bilinear method) by a step size $\\Delta$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1}(\\mathbf{I}+\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\\\\n& \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\Delta \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe unroll the above recurrent representation, after which we have\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\cdots+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as a convolutional representation $y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u$, where the convolution kernel\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\cdots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" is the discrete convolution operator, $u$ represents the input sequence $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, and $y$ represents the corresponding output sequence $\\left(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{L}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 2. LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (Avg.

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.66)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently.

Event-Former treats sparse input events as a spatially unordered set and models their spatial interactions using self-attention mechanism. An associative memory-augmented recurrent module is used to correlate with the stored representation computed from past events. A memory addressing mechanism is proposed to store and retrieve the latent states only where these events occur and update them only when they occur. The representation learning shift from input space to the latent memory space resulting in reduced computation cost for processing each event.

Deep Residual Output Layers for Neural Language Generation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention state space models*\n\n*Nikolaos Pappas, James Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evaluations on three language generation tasks show that the output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing the structure of the output space.\n\n**Abstract:** Many tasks, including language generation, benefit from learning the structure of the output space, particularly when the space of output labels is large and the data is sparse. State-of-the-art neural language models indirectly capture the output space structure in their classifier weights since they lack parameter sharing across output labels. Learning shared output label mappings helps, but existing methods have limited expressivity and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of more powerful shared mappings for output labels, and propose a deep residual output mapping with dropout between layers to better capture the structure of the output space and avoid overfitting. Evaluations on three language generation tasks show that our output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing the structure of the output space.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. AutoInt: Automatic Feature Interaction Learning via Self-Attentive Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention state space models*\n\n*Yewen Xu, Ming Zhang, Jian Tang, Zhijian Duan, Weiping Song, Chence Shi, Zhiping Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad or an item, is critical to many online applications such as online advertising and recommender systems. The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on high-order combinatorial features (\\textit{a.k.a.} cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding low-dimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the \\emph{AutoInt} to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multi-head self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the low-dimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head self-attentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.

Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention state space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Stefano Ermon, Yoshua Bengio, Stephen Baccus, Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Eric Nguyen, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. ViewFormer: NeRF-free Neural Rendering from Few Images Using Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention state space models*\n\n*Robert Babu\u0161ka, Torsten Sattler, Erik Derner, Jon\u00e1\u0161 Kulh\u00e1nek*\n\n**Abstract:** Novel view synthesis is a long-standing problem. In this work, we consider a variant of the problem where we are given only a few context views sparsely covering a scene or an object. The goal is to predict novel viewpoints in the scene, which requires learning priors. The current state of the art is based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), and while achieving impressive results, the methods suffer from long training times as they require evaluating millions of 3D point samples via a neural network for each image. We propose a 2D-only method that maps multiple context views and a query pose to a new image in a single pass of a neural network. Our model uses a two-stage architecture consisting of a codebook and a transformer model. The codebook is used to embed individual images into a smaller latent space, and the transformer solves the view synthesis task in this more compact space. To train our model efficiently, we introduce a novel branching attention mechanism that allows us to use the same model not only for neural rendering but also for camera pose estimation. Experimental results on real-world scenes show that our approach is competitive compared to NeRF-based methods while not reasoning explicitly in 3D, and it is faster to train.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by combining sparse attention mechanisms with state space models, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hybrid Architectures\n### Combining Sparse Attention and State Space Models\n- The concept of combining sparse attention with state space models is promising, as seen in the context of improving efficiency and scalability. For instance, the Sparse Mamba (S-Mamba) model introduces a structured state space model (SSM) that could potentially be integrated with sparse attention mechanisms. S-Mamba drops the need for attention layers or multilayer perception blocks, which could be replaced or augmented with sparse attention to enhance efficiency and performance.\n\n## Efficiency Maintenance\n### Reducing Computational Complexity\n- The Sparse Transformer, which reduces the complexity of self-attention from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n\\sqrt{n})\\), is a significant advancement. This approach can be integrated into state space models to maintain efficiency. For example, applying sparse factorizations to the self-attention matrices within an SSM architecture could help in handling larger input sizes efficiently.\n\n### Controllability and Observability\n- The S-Mamba model reinforces controllability and observability in its architecture, which leads to a reduction in parameters and training time. This approach can be combined with sparse attention to ensure that the model remains efficient while processing long sequences. By enforcing controllability and observability, the model can be made more sparse and efficient without compromising performance.\n\n## Balancing Local and Global Information Processing\n### Adaptive Sparse Attention\n- Adaptive sparse attention patterns can dynamically capture relevant information, which is crucial for balancing local and global information processing. This approach can be integrated into state space models to ensure that the model focuses on the most relevant features while processing sequences. Dynamic, head-specific sparsity patterns can help in maintaining efficiency and improving model quality.\n\n### Priority Routing in MoE\n- The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, particularly the Sparse MoE, uses priority routing to focus on the most important patches or tokens. This mechanism can be adapted to state space models to ensure that local and global information is processed efficiently. By assigning importance scores to different parts of the input, the model can prioritize processing the most relevant information.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n### Long Context Processing\n- Techniques like LongRoPE and FlashAttention, which extend context windows, can be combined with sparse attention and state space models to handle long sequences efficiently. The key is to avoid extensive fine-tuning costs and memory inefficiencies, which can be mitigated by using sparse attention and state space models[Analysis].\n\n### Recurrent Processing\n- Recurrent architectures, such as those discussed in \"Just Read Twice,\" can be integrated with state space models to improve recall and efficiency. This approach can leverage insights about information ordering and recall to enhance model performance[Analysis].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths of both sparse attention mechanisms and state space models, leading to more efficient, scalable, and high-performance autoregressive language models.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nWhile state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state management hybrid architectures\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. NASViT: Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Vision Transformers with Gradient Conflict aware Supernet Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Chengyue Gong, Dilin Wang, Meng Li, Xinlei Chen, Zhicheng Yan, Yuandong Tian, Qiang Liu, Vikas Chandra*\n\n**TL;DR:** A discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing accurate and ef\ufb01cient vision transformers (ViTs) is an important but challenging task. Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks. Our discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.

Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, A. Gholami, Albert Eaton Shaw, Nicholas Lee, K. Mangalam, J. Malik, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Squeezeformer is proposed which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes and incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal.\n\n**Abstract:** The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs.

Efficient Modulation for Vision Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Xu Ma, Xiyang Dai, Jianwei Yang, Bin Xiao, Yinpeng Chen, Yun Fu, Lu Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work revisits the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block, and proposes the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for networks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present efficient modulation, a novel design for efficient vision networks. We revisit the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block. We demonstrate that the modulation mechanism is particularly well suited for efficient networks and further tailor the modulation design by proposing the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for our networks. Benefiting from the prominent representational ability of modulation mechanism and the proposed efficient design, our network can accomplish better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency and set new state-of-the-art performance in the zoo of efficient networks. When integrating EfficientMod with the vanilla self-attention block, we obtain the hybrid architecture which further improves the performance without loss of efficiency. We carry out comprehensive experiments to verify EfficientMod's performance. With fewer parameters, our EfficientMod-s performs 0.6 top-1 accuracy better than EfficientFormerV2-s2 and is 25% faster on GPU, and 2.9 better than MobileViTv2-1.0 at the same GPU latency. Additionally, our method presents a notable improvement in downstream tasks, outperforming EfficientFormerV2-s by 3.6 mIoU on the ADE20K benchmark.

GRILLBot In Practice: Lessons and Tradeoffs Deploying Large Language Models for Adaptable Conversational Task Assistants\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Jeffrey Dalton, Federico Rossetto, Iain Mackie, Niklas Tecklenburg, Carlos Gemmell, Sophie Fischer*\n\n**Abstract:** We tackle the challenge of building real-world multimodal assistants for complex real-world tasks. We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Generating Knowledge Graphs by Employing Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques within the Scholarly Domain\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Enrico Motta, Davide Buscaldi, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Francesco Osborne, Danilo Dess\u00ec*\n\n**Abstract:** The continuous growth of scientific literature brings innovations and, at the same time, raises new challenges. One of them is related to the fact that its analysis has become difficult due to the high volume of published papers for which manual effort for annotations and management is required. Novel technological infrastructures are needed to help researchers, research policy makers, and companies to time-efficiently browse, analyse, and forecast scientific research. Knowledge graphs i.e., large networks of entities and relationships, have proved to be effective solution in this space. Scientific knowledge graphs focus on the scholarly domain and typically contain metadata describing research publications such as authors, venues, organizations, research topics, and citations. However, the current generation of knowledge graphs lacks of an explicit representation of the knowledge presented in the research papers. As such, in this paper, we present a new architecture that takes advantage of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods for extracting entities and relationships from research publications and integrates them in a large-scale knowledge graph. Within this research work, we i) tackle the challenge of knowledge extraction by employing several state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing and Text Mining tools, ii) describe an approach for integrating entities and relationships generated by these tools, iii) show the advantage of such an hybrid system over alternative approaches, and vi) as a chosen use case, we generated a scientific knowledge graph including 109,105 triples, extracted from 26,827 abstracts of papers within the Semantic Web domain. As our approach is general and can be applied to any domain, we expect that it can facilitate the management, analysis, dissemination, and processing of scientific knowledge.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. FUSEE: A Fully Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store (Extended Version)\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid architectures*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed in-memory key-value (KV) stores are embracing the disaggregated memory (DM) architecture for higher resource utilization. However, existing KV stores on DM employ a semi-disaggregated design that stores KV pairs on DM but manages metadata with monolithic metadata servers, hence still suffering from low resource efficiency on metadata servers. To address this issue, this paper proposes FUSEE, a FUlly memory-diSaggrEgated KV StorE that brings disaggregation to metadata management. FUSEE replicates metadata, i.e., the index and memory management information, on memory nodes, manages them directly on the client side, and handles complex failures under the DM architecture. To scalably replicate the index on clients, FUSEE proposes a client-centric replication protocol that allows clients to concurrently access and modify the replicated index. To efficiently manage disaggregated memory, FUSEE adopts a two-level memory management scheme that splits the memory management duty among clients and memory nodes. Finally, to handle the metadata corruption under client failures, FUSEE leverages an embedded operation log scheme to repair metadata with low log maintenance overhead. We evaluate FUSEE with both micro and YCSB hybrid benchmarks. The experimental results show that FUSEE outperforms the state-of-the-art KV stores on DM by up to 4.5 times with less resource consumption.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state management in hybrid architectures that combine attention mechanisms and State Space Models (SSMs), here are some key insights and techniques from the available sources and the analysis provided:\n\n## Methods for Maintaining and Updating States in Combined Attention-SSM Systems\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms can be highly effective. For example, the SPADE approach augments a SSM into the bottom layer of the model and employs efficient local attention methods for other layers. This combination helps in capturing both global patterns (via SSMs) and local dependencies (via attention mechanisms).\n\n- **Layer-Specific Roles**: Assigning SSMs to handle global information and attention mechanisms to handle local dependencies can optimize state management. This approach ensures that each component leverages its strengths, reducing the complexity of state updates.\n\n## Approaches for Reducing Memory Overhead in State Tracking\n\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)**: This mechanism, introduced in SeqBoat, allows neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements. This can significantly reduce memory overhead by only activating necessary components based on the input content.\n\n- **Dynamic Selection Mechanisms**: Implementing dynamic selection mechanisms, as suggested in the MambaFormer approach, can optimize resource usage. By selectively updating states based on the importance of the input content, the model can reduce computational and memory overhead.\n\n## Techniques for Selective State Updates\n\n- **Adaptive Computation**: Models like Mamba and SeqBoat use adaptive computation techniques where the model parameters or the activation of sub-modules are adjusted based on the input content. This selective processing helps in maintaining model quality while reducing unnecessary computations and state updates.\n\n- **Efficient Local Attention**: Using efficient local attention methods, as in SPADE, can help in reducing the computational costs associated with state updates. This approach focuses on local dependencies while leveraging SSMs for global information, thus optimizing the state management process.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Transactional State Management**: Although not directly related to neural networks, the concept of transactional state management from actor systems (as discussed in the SmSa paper) can provide insights into how to manage complex state dependencies efficiently. This involves declaring data dependencies and enforcing them transparently, which could be adapted to manage states in hybrid neural architectures.\n\n- **Composable Architecture**: The idea of composable architecture, where components are modular and can be integrated or updated independently, can be applied to neural networks. This approach, as seen in Shopify and Netflix, allows for flexible and scalable systems, which can be beneficial in managing and updating states in hybrid models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient state management systems for hybrid autoregressive language models, balancing the strengths of attention mechanisms and SSMs while optimizing computational and memory resources.\n",

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.56)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Penguin: Parallel-Packed Homomorphic Encryption for Fast Graph Convolutional Network Inference\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates parallel computation memory patterns*\n\n*Ran Ran, Nuo Xu, Tao Liu, Wei Wang, Gang Quan, Wujie Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Penguin is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data, and is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data.\n\n**Abstract:** The marriage of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables the inference of graph data on the cloud with significantly enhanced client data privacy. However, the tremendous computation and memory overhead associated with HE operations challenges the practicality of HE-based GCN inference. GCN inference involves a sequence of expensive matrix-matrix multiplications, and we observe that directly applying the state-of-the-art HE-based secure matrix-matrix multiplication solutions to accelerate HE-GCN inference is far less efficient as it does not exploit the unique aggregation mechanism of two-dimension graph node-features in GCN layer computation. As a result, in this paper, we propose a novel HE-based ciphertext packing technique, i.e., Penguin , that can take advantage of the unique computation pattern during the HE-GCN inference to significantly reduce the computation and memory overhead associated with HE operations. Specifically, Penguin employs ( i ) an effective two-dimension parallel packing technique for feature ciphertext with optimal graph node partitioning and graph feature interleaving, and ( ii ) an interleaved assembly technique that can effectively make use of blank slots to merge ciphertexts after feature reduction and thus significantly reduce costly rotation operations. We perform detailed theoretical analysis to support our arguments. In the meantime, our experimental results also show that Penguin can achieve up to \u223c 10 \u00d7 speedup and around \u223c 79% reduction in computational memory overhead, significantly out-performing state-of-the-art solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can ensure the protection of both graph structure and features when accelerating HE-GCN inference on encrypted data.

Memory-Efficient Pipeline-Parallel DNN Training\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates parallel computation memory patterns*\n\n*D. Narayanan, Amar Phanishayee, Kaiyu Shi, Xie Chen, M. Zaharia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining, able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Many state-of-the-art results in domains such as NLP and computer vision have been obtained by scaling up the number of parameters in existing models. However, the weight parameters and intermediate outputs of these large models often do not fit in the main memory of a single accelerator device; this means that it is necessary to use multiple accelerators to train large models, which is challenging to do in a time-efficient way. In this work, we propose PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining. Our system uses a novel pipelining and weight gradient coalescing strategy, combined with the double buffering of weights, to ensure high throughput, low memory footprint, and weight update semantics similar to data parallelism. In addition, PipeDream-2BW automatically partitions the model over the available hardware resources, while being cognizant of constraints such as compute capabilities, memory capacities, and interconnect topologies, and determines when to employ existing memory-savings techniques, such as activation recomputation, that trade off extra computation for lower memory footprint. PipeDream-2BW is able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 169  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 3. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates parallel computation memory patterns*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Massively Parallel and Asynchronous Tsetlin Machine Architecture Supporting Almost Constant-Time Scaling\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates parallel computation memory patterns*\n\n*Kuruge Darshana Abeyrathna, Bimal Bhattarai, Morten Goodwin, S. Gorji, Ole-Christoffer Granmo, Lei Jiao, Rupsa Saha, Rohan Kumar Yadav*\n\n**TL;DR:** It turns out that the decentralized TM learning algorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant loss in learning accuracy, and it is shown that the approach provides up to 50 times faster learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Using logical clauses to represent patterns, Tsetlin machines (TMs) have recently obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory footprint, energy, and learning speed on several benchmarks. A team of Tsetlin automata (TAs) composes each clause, thus driving the entire learning process. These are rewarded/penalized according to three local rules that optimize global behaviour. Each clause votes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a majority vote. In the parallel and asynchronous architecture that we propose here, every clause runs in its own thread for massive parallelism. For each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the clauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach the processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting decentralized learning. Thus, rather than processing training examples one-by-one as in the original TM, the clauses access the training examples simultaneously, updating themselves and the local voting tallies in parallel. There is no synchronization among the clause threads, apart from atomic adds to the local voting tallies. Operating asynchronously, each team of TA will most of the time operate on partially calculated or outdated voting tallies. However, across diverse learning tasks, it turns out that our decentralized TM learning algorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant loss in learning accuracy. Further, we show that the approach provides up to 50 times faster learning. Finally, learning time is almost constant for reasonable clause amounts. For sufficiently large clause numbers, computation time increases approximately proportionally. Our parallel and asynchronous architecture thus allows processing of more massive datasets and operating with more clauses for higher accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Neiswanger, S. Sra, E. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A notable feature of Frank-Wolfe algorithms is that they do not depend on worst-case bounded delays, but only (mildly) on expected delays, making them robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads.\n\n**Abstract:** We study parallel and distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms; the former on shared memory machines with mini-batching, and the latter in a delayed update framework. In both cases, we perform computations asynchronously whenever possible. We assume block-separable constraints as in Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) method (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2013), but our analysis subsumes BCFW and reveals problemdependent quantities that govern the speedups of our methods over BCFW. A notable feature of our algorithms is that they do not depend on worst-case bounded delays, but only (mildly) on expected delays, making them robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads. We present experiments on structural SVM and Group Fused Lasso, and observe significant speedups over competing state-of-the-art (and synchronous) methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient parallel computation, memory access optimization, and balancing computation and memory efficiency, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Methods for Parallel Processing of Selective State Updates\n\n- **Selective State Space Models**: The Mamba and DenseSSM papers highlight the importance of selective state updates. For example, Mamba's approach involves content-based state selection, which can be parallelized efficiently by letting SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses. This method allows for dynamic and selective updates of states, which can be parallelized across multiple threads or cores[5,.\n\n- **Hierarchical State Connections**: DenseSSM's hierarchical state connections retain fine-grained information and maintain training parallelizability and inference efficiency. This hierarchical approach can be optimized for parallel computation by distributing the computation across different layers and states[3,.\n\n## Techniques for Optimizing Memory Access Patterns in State-Based Models\n\n- **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**: Efficient memory structures and operating schemes are crucial for high-performance accelerators. The paper on automated optimization for memory-efficient high-performance accelerators discusses techniques such as slicing and tiling for activation, and flexibly allocating data components in multiple buffer sub-blocks. These methods improve data reuse and reduce the processing time required for data movement, which is essential for optimizing memory access patterns in state-based models.\n\n- **In-Memory Computing**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing, as discussed in the Nature article, can significantly optimize memory access patterns. By storing and processing data within the same memory unit, memristor crossbars reduce the latency associated with data movement, making it particularly efficient for operations like matrix multiplications in transformer networks.\n\n## Approaches for Balancing Computation and Memory Efficiency in Hybrid Architectures\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures with Dynamic Activation**: The concept of Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) from SeqBoat allows for dynamic activation of components, reducing computational overhead. This approach can be combined with selective state updates and attention mechanisms to balance computation and memory efficiency. By activating only necessary components, the model can achieve better parallelizability and reduce memory access overhead[5,.\n\n- **Combining SSMs with Local Attention**: The SSD framework and Mamba-2's refined selective SSM demonstrate the benefits of combining state space models with local attention mechanisms. This combination provides complementary benefits, such as preserving important information through hierarchical state connections and optimizing computation through selective updates and local attention[5,.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizing GPUs for parallel computation, as explained in the CUDA tutorial, is crucial for handling the large-scale, parallel computations required by neural networks. GPUs can process large batches of data simultaneously, reducing training time and improving overall efficiency.\n\n- **Automated Optimization Algorithms**: Automating optimization algorithms for memory-efficient high-performance accelerators can significantly enhance performance. Techniques such as flexible internal memory, programmable data control, and memory-allocation algorithms can maximize the performance of accelerators while automating hardware scheduling.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014selective state updates, optimized memory access patterns, and balanced computation and memory efficiency in hybrid architectures\u2014researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models. These models can leverage parallel computation, reduce memory access latency, and balance expressiveness with computational cost, ultimately leading to better performance and scalability.\n",

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K).

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Parnichkun, Aman Timalsina, David W. Romero, Quinn McIntyre, Beidi Chen, A. Rudra, Ce Zhang, Christopher R\u00e9, Stefano Ermon, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks.

Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*Yihua Zhang, Pingzhi Li, Junyuan Hong, Jiaxiang Li, Yimeng Zhang, Wenqing Zheng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jason D.

Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity.

MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5.

However, conventional MoEs pose challenges at scale due to the need to store all experts in memory. In this paper, we push MoE to the limit. We propose extremely parameter-efficient MoE by uniquely combining MoE architecture with lightweight experts.Our MoE architecture outperforms standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and is on par with full fine-tuning by only updating the lightweight experts -- less than 1% of an 11B parameters model.

LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via a Hybrid Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*Benyou Wang, Chen Zhang, Shunian Chen, Dingjie Song, Xidong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is crucial for video understanding, high-resolution image understanding, and multi-modal agents. This involves a series of systematic optimizations, including model architecture, data construction and training strategy, particularly addressing challenges such as \\textit{degraded performance with more images} and \\textit{high computational costs}.

ACORN: Adaptive Coordinate Networks for Neural Scene Representation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*Gordon Wetzstein, Marco Monteiro, Eric R. Chan, Connor Z. Lin, David B. Lindell, Julien N. P. Martel*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural representations have emerged as a new paradigm for applications in rendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditional representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition, similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters, a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then, hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an order of magnitude.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hybrid architecture memory optimization*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range of sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks at both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on sequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence modeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat.\n\n**Conference:** sparse-modular-activation-for-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient hybrid architectures, memory optimization, and maintaining model quality, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Methods for Combining Different Architectural Components Efficiently\n\n- **Hybrid AI Architectures**: Combining different models, such as Statistical Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), can enhance performance.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 554  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 3.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization long sequences\"*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training linear attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training linear attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers\n  for Flexible Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient state compression\"*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained Transformer models like T5 and BART have advanced the state of\nthe art on a wide range of text generation tasks. Compressing these models into\nsmaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural\nnetwork compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization\nare limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this\npaper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder\nframework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular\nTransformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or\nmore consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and\nknowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly\nassembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different\nperformance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a\nsingle training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular\nTransformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with\nlittle to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. TACO-RL: Task Aware Prompt Compression Optimization with Reinforcement\n  Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient state compression\"*\n\n*Shivam Shandilya, Menglin Xia, Supriyo Ghosh, Huiqiang Jiang, Jue Zhang, Qianhui Wu, Victor R\u00fchle*\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in\nvarious applications has led to a surge in the size of prompts required for\noptimal performance, leading to challenges in computational efficiency. Prompt\ncompression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens\nwithout compromising on the task performance. However, existing prompt\ncompression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information\nentropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails\nto capture task-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt\ncompression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing\nTransformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning\nprocess with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE\nalgorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and\nchallenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code\nsummarization. We demonstrate that our RL-guided compression method improves\nthe task performance by 8% - 260% across these three scenarios over\nstate-of-the-art compression techniques while satisfying the same compression\nrate and latency requirements.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T18:11:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-23T07:40:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization long sequences\"*\n\n*Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long\nsequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP\nmethods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in\nsub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based\nlanguage models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel\n(LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language\nmodels. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication\nmechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which\nsharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the\npractical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state\ncaching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters.\nFurthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP\nwith all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for\ndistributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with\nvarying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up\nto 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than\nexisting SP methods while being significantly faster.

LongNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000,000,000 Tokens\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization long sequences\"*\n\n*Jiayu Ding, Shuming Ma, Li Dong, Xingxing Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Nanning Zheng, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling sequence length has become a critical demand in the era of large\nlanguage models. However, existing methods struggle with either computational\ncomplexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length\nrestricted. To address this issue, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant\nthat can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without\nsacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose\ndilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the\ndistance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear\ncomputation complexity and a logarithm dependency between any two tokens in a\nsequence; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long\nsequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard\nattention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing\nTransformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet\nyields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language\ntasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences,\ne.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-05T17:59:38Z  (*Updated: 2023-07-19T12:25:35Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training linear attention\"*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Giraffe: Adventures in Expanding Context Lengths in LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training linear attention\"*\n\n*Siddartha Naidu, Arvind Sundararajan, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Deep Karkhanis, Arka Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding. We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient state compression\"*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 4.

An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 5. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization long sequences\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Eric Nguyen, Hermann Kumbong, Daniel Y. Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, here are some key findings and references that align with the specified keywords and details:\n\n## Test-time Training Mechanisms in Efficient Attention Models\n\n- The concept of test-time fine-tuning, particularly relevant in the context of efficient attention models, is discussed in the paper on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\". This work highlights how test-time fine-tuning can significantly improve the performance of large language models by fine-tuning the parameters on the test instance itself, which is especially beneficial when the prompt is not well-represented in the pre-training data.\n\n## State Compression Techniques for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- The importance of state compression and management is emphasized in the analysis note, which mentions the trade-off between state size and recall ability. For efficient state compression, adaptive techniques are crucial. While the provided sources do not explicitly detail state compression methods, the concept of IO-aware algorithms and hierarchical processing mentioned in the analysis note suggests that efficient state management strategies are vital for handling long sequences.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations for Linear Attention\n\n- The paper \"Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time\" discusses the learnability and efficiency of linear attention models. It shows how linear attention can be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS, which can be efficiently learned and generalized. This work, however, does not specifically focus on hardware optimizations but provides a theoretical foundation for efficient linear attention models.\n\n- For hardware-specific optimizations, the paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator leveraging memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer networks, including those using linear attention, by reducing the computational complexity and enhancing parallelizability.\n\n## Integration of Compression with Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- The integration of compression techniques with test-time adaptation is not explicitly covered in the provided sources. However, the concept of adaptive fine-tuning and its potential to be combined with efficient state compression techniques can be inferred. The work on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" suggests that adaptive fine-tuning can be optimized further by incorporating efficient state management strategies, which could include compression techniques.\n\n## Memory Management in Long-Context Models\n\n- Memory management is a critical aspect of handling long-context models. The analysis note highlights the importance of IO-aware algorithms, tiling, and hierarchical processing to manage memory efficiently. These strategies help in balancing the trade-off between state size and recall ability, ensuring that the model can handle long sequences without significant performance degradation.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Test-Time Training\n\n- The paper \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" provides insights into efficient implementations of test-time training. It introduces the ADAPTIVE SIFT method, which stops fine-tuning when further compute does not yield proportional performance gain, thus optimizing the use of computational resources.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" is particularly relevant here. It describes a hardware accelerator that leverages memristor-based in-memory computing to efficiently process transformer networks, including those handling long sequences. This approach enhances the parallelizability and reduces the computational complexity, making it suitable for long sequence processing.\n\nIn summary, the key papers and concepts that can help the researchers include:\n\n- **Test-time fine-tuning and efficient attention**: \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\".\n- **Hardware optimizations for linear attention**: \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\".\n- **Efficient state management and compression**: Implicitly suggested in the analysis note, emphasizing IO-aware algorithms and hierarchical processing.\n- **Integration and memory management**: While not explicitly covered, the combination of adaptive fine-tuning with efficient state management strategies is a promising direction.\n\nThese insights should help in designing an improved autoregressive language model that is efficient, scalable, and optimized for both computational resources and hardware performance.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/25 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nVaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e.\"mixing\"the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e.\"mixing\"spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models.

Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated linear attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations\nof linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention\nimplementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that\nenable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when\ngenerating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Experimentation in Content Moderation using RWKV\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Umut Yildirim, Rohan Dutta, Burak Yildirim, Atharva Vaidya*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates the RWKV model's efficacy in content moderation\nthrough targeted experimentation. We introduce a novel dataset specifically\ndesigned for distillation into smaller models, enhancing content moderation\npractices. This comprehensive dataset encompasses images, videos, sounds, and\ntext data that present societal challenges. Leveraging advanced Large Language\nModels (LLMs), we generated an extensive set of responses -- 558,958 for text\nand 83,625 for images -- to train and refine content moderation systems. Our\ncore experimentation involved fine-tuning the RWKV model, capitalizing on its\nCPU-efficient architecture to address large-scale content moderation tasks. By\nhighlighting the dataset's potential for knowledge distillation, this study not\nonly demonstrates RWKV's capability in improving the accuracy and efficiency of\ncontent moderation systems but also paves the way for developing more compact,\nresource-efficient models in this domain.

Latent Diffusion for Language Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient language models\"*\n\n*Justin Lovelace, Varsha Kishore, Chao Wan, Eliot Shekhtman, Kilian Q.

Recent attempts to adapt diffusion to\nlanguage have presented diffusion as an alternative to existing pretrained\nlanguage models. We view diffusion and existing language models as\ncomplementary. We demonstrate that encoder-decoder language models can be\nutilized to efficiently learn high-quality language autoencoders. We then\ndemonstrate that continuous diffusion models can be learned in the latent space\nof the language autoencoder, enabling us to sample continuous latent\nrepresentations that can be decoded into natural language with the pretrained\ndecoder. We validate the effectiveness of our approach for unconditional,\nclass-conditional, and sequence-to-sequence language generation. We demonstrate\nacross multiple diverse data sets that our latent language diffusion models are\nsignificantly more effective than previous diffusion language models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-19T13:57:06Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-07T15:35:45Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient language models\"*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Noam Shazeer, Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Wojciech Ma\u0144ke, David R. So*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention. Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the specified keywords and details, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Gated Linear Attention Implementation Details\n\n- The paper on **Gated Linear Transformer (GaLiTe)** introduces a self-attention mechanism that uses a gated structure to control the flow of information, allowing it to uncover relationships far in the past. GaLiTe employs a parameterized feature map to calculate key and query vectors, eliminating the need for a fixed kernel feature map. This approach is designed to be highly parallelizable and computationally efficient.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Techniques for Long Sequences\n\n- **Taipan** model combines Mamba-2 blocks with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to efficiently process long sequences. The SALs use a gating network to select important tokens, reducing the computational cost by creating a sparser attention weight map. This allows for longer sliding windows to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n- **E-Tamba** model integrates Transformer and Mamba layers, where non-critical Transformer layers are replaced with more efficient Mamba layers. This hybrid approach reduces inference memory usage significantly while maintaining performance in language modeling tasks.\n\n## Integration of Linear Attention with Recurrent Architectures\n\n- **GaLiTe** and **AGaLiTe** models introduce recurrent alternatives to the self-attention mechanism, integrating linear transformers with gated structures. These models are designed to handle partial observability and long-range dependencies efficiently, which can be beneficial when combined with recurrent architectures.\n\n- **HGRN2** (Hierarchically Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion) enhances the expressiveness of linear RNNs by introducing a state expansion mechanism. This approach provides a linear attention interpretation and is hardware-efficient, making it a viable candidate for integration with linear attention mechanisms.\n\n## State Management in Efficient Language Models\n\n- **Taipan** model uses an attention budget constraint to manage the number of tokens selected for attention processing. This constraint is incorporated into the training objective, ensuring efficient state updates and maintaining computational efficiency during inference.\n\n- **GaLiTe** and **AGaLiTe** models manage state through a gated mechanism that controls the flow of information, allowing for arbitrary context memory while balancing precision and computational efficiency.\n\n## Causal Convolution Approaches for Preventing Information Leakage\n\n- While the provided sources do not specifically discuss causal convolution in the context of preventing information leakage, the concept of using causal masking or local convolutional augmentation is implied in the context of maintaining sequence order and preventing future information from influencing past predictions. For example, **Taipan** uses a sliding window attention mechanism that inherently respects the causal structure of sequences.\n\n## Test-Time Training with Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **GaLiTe** and **AGaLiTe** models are designed for online learning and can handle partial observability, which suggests they can be adapted for test-time training. These models maintain a recurrent state that can be updated during inference, making them suitable for efficient test-time training.\n\n## Hardware Optimization for Attention Computations\n\n- **GaLiTe** and **AGaLiTe** models are optimized for hardware efficiency, with computations that are highly parallelizable and have a context-independent inference cost. This makes them more efficient in terms of computational resources and memory usage compared to traditional transformer models.\n\n- **E-Tamba** model also demonstrates hardware efficiency by reducing inference memory usage significantly compared to pure Transformer-based models, making it a promising approach for hardware-optimized language models.\n\n### Summary for the Researcher\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention**: GaLiTe and AGaLiTe models provide a robust framework for integrating gated linear attention, which can be combined with existing autoregressive models to enhance efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- **RWKV Architecture Inspiration**: While the provided sources do not directly discuss RWKV, the integration of linear attention with recurrent architectures, as seen in GaLiTe and HGRN2, can serve as a starting point for incorporating RWKV concepts into the model design.\n\n- **Memory Efficiency and State Management**: Taipan and E-Tamba models offer efficient state management techniques, such as selective attention and layer transplantation, which can be crucial for handling long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Causal Convolution and Local Attention**: The use of sliding window attention in Taipan and the gated mechanisms in GaLiTe/AGaLiTe ensure causal processing, preventing information leakage and maintaining sequence order.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages gated linear attention, efficient state management, and hardware-optimized computations to achieve better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training language models\"*\n\n*Manli Shu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Zhiding Yu, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Chaowei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) is proposed, a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample and performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training language models\"*\n\n*Shuai Zhao, Xiaohan Wang, Linchao Zhu, Yezhou Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident, and builds different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation~(TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed \\textit{reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback~(RLCF)} framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: \"causal convolution attention\"*\n\n*SHIYANG LI, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** First, convolutional self-attention is proposed by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism, and LogSparse Transformer is proposed, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$ memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1182  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n#### 5.

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 994  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression language models\"*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7.

We propose to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer, we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Cross-Lingual Fine-Grained Entity Typing\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training language models\"*\n\n*Nila Selvaraj, Yasumasa Onoe, Greg Durrett*\n\n**Abstract:** The growth of cross-lingual pre-trained models has enabled NLP tools to\nrapidly generalize to new languages. While these models have been applied to\ntasks involving entities, their ability to explicitly predict typological\nfeatures of these entities across languages has not been established. In this\npaper, we present a unified cross-lingual fine-grained entity typing model\ncapable of handling over 100 languages and analyze this model's ability to\ngeneralize to languages and entities unseen during training. We train this\nmodel on cross-lingual training data collected from Wikipedia hyperlinks in\nmultiple languages (training languages). During inference, our model takes an\nentity mention and context in a particular language (test language, possibly\nnot in the training languages) and predicts fine-grained types for that entity.\nGeneralizing to new languages and unseen entities are the fundamental\nchallenges of this entity typing setup, so we focus our evaluation on these\nsettings and compare against simple yet powerful string match baselines.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on unseen\nlanguages such as Japanese, Tamil, Arabic, Serbian, and Persian. In addition,\nour approach substantially improves performance on unseen entities (even in\nunseen languages) over the baselines, and human evaluation shows a strong\nability to predict relevant types in these settings.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-15T03:22:30Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-15T03:22:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Character-Level Approach to the Text Normalization Problem Based on a\n  New Causal Encoder\n\n*From Search Query: \"causal convolution attention\"*\n\n*Adri\u00e1n Javaloy Born\u00e1s, Gin\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Mateos*\n\n**Abstract:** Text normalization is a ubiquitous process that appears as the first step of\nmany Natural Language Processing problems. However, previous Deep Learning\napproaches have suffered from so-called silly errors, which are undetectable on\nunsupervised frameworks, making those models unsuitable for deployment. In this\nwork, we make use of an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture that\novercomes these undetectable errors by using a fine-grained character-level\napproach rather than a word-level one. Furthermore, our new general-purpose\nencoder based on causal convolutions, called Causal Feature Extractor (CFE), is\nintroduced and compared to other common encoders. The experimental results show\nthe feasibility of this encoder, which leverages the attention mechanisms the\nmost and obtains better results in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and\nconvergence time.

Many works apply the causal\nconvolution to improve streaming transformer ignoring the lookahead context. We\npropose to use non-causal convolution to process the center block and lookahead\ncontext separately. This method leverages the lookahead context in convolution\nand maintains similar training and decoding efficiency. Given the similar\nlatency, using the non-causal convolution with lookahead context gives better\naccuracy than causal convolution, especially for open-domain dictation\nscenarios. Besides, this paper applies talking-head attention and a novel\nhistory context compression scheme to further improve the performance. The\ntalking-head attention improves the multi-head self-attention by transferring\ninformation among different heads.

SVD-LLM: Truncation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Large\n  Language Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression language models\"*\n\n*Xin Wang, Yu Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Mi Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by their\nsubstantial sizes, which necessitate LLM compression methods for practical\ndeployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a promising solution for\nLLM compression. However, state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods\nhave two key limitations: truncating smaller singular values may lead to higher\ncompression loss, and the lack of update on the compressed weight after SVD\ntruncation. In this work, we propose SVD-LLM, a new SVD-based LLM compression\nmethod that addresses the limitations of existing methods. SVD-LLM incorporates\na truncation-aware data whitening strategy to ensure a direct mapping between\nsingular values and compression loss. Moreover, SVD-LLM adopts a layer-wise\nclosed-form model parameter update strategy to compensate for accuracy\ndegradation under high compression ratios. We evaluate SVD-LLM on a total of 10\ndatasets and eight models from three different LLM families at four different\nscales. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SVD-LLM over\nstate-of-the-arts, especially at high model compression ratios.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-12T07:31:18Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-28T13:41:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. LLMLingua: Compressing Prompts for Accelerated Inference of Large\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression language models\"*\n\n*Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in various applications due to\ntheir astonishing capabilities. With advancements in technologies such as\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL), the prompts fed\nto LLMs are becoming increasingly lengthy, even exceeding tens of thousands of\ntokens. To accelerate model inference and reduce cost, this paper presents\nLLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method that involves a budget\ncontroller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, a\ntoken-level iterative compression algorithm to better model the interdependence\nbetween compressed contents, and an instruction tuning based method for\ndistribution alignment between language models. We conduct experiments and\nanalysis over four datasets from different scenarios, i.e., GSM8K, BBH,\nShareGPT, and Arxiv-March23; showing that the proposed approach yields\nstate-of-the-art performance and allows for up to 20x compression with little\nperformance loss.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training language models\"*\n\n*Yu Sun, Moritz Hardt*\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Selecting Informative Contexts Improves Language Model Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training language models\"*\n\n*Nicole Beckage, Richard Antonello, Javier Turek, Alexander Huth*\n\n**Abstract:** Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Further, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a test metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning -- we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Causal Discovery with Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"causal convolution attention\"*\n\n*Meike Nauta, Christin Seifert, Doina Bucur*\n\n**Abstract:** Having insight into the causal associations in a complex system facilitates decision making, e.g., for medical treatments, urban infrastructure improvements or financial investments. The amount of observational data grows, which enables the discovery of causal relationships between variables from observation of their behaviour in time. Existing methods for causal discovery from time series data do not yet exploit the representational power of deep learning. We therefore present the Temporal Causal Discovery Framework (TCDF), a deep learning framework that learns a causal graph structure by discovering causal relationships in observational time series data. TCDF uses attention-based convolutional neural networks combined with a causal validation step. By interpreting the internal parameters of the convolutional networks, TCDF can also discover the time delay between a cause and the occurrence of its effect. Our framework learns temporal causal graphs, which can include confounders and instantaneous effects. Experiments on financial and neuroscientific benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance of TCDF on discovering causal relationships in continuous time series data. Furthermore, we show that TCDF can circumstantially discover the presence of hidden confounders. Our broadly applicable framework can be used to gain novel insights into the causal dependencies in a complex system, which is important for reliable predictions, knowledge discovery and data-driven decision making.\n\n**Proceeding:** machine-learning-and-knowledge-extraction\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"causal convolution attention\"*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 5. TT-Rec: Tensor Train Compression for Deep Learning Recommendation Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression language models\"*\n\n*Carole-Jean Wu, Xing Liu, Bilge Acun, Chunxing Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** The memory capacity of embedding tables in deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) is increasing dramatically from tens of GBs to TBs across the industry. Given the fast growth in DLRMs, novel solutions are urgently needed, in order to enable fast and efficient DLRM innovations. At the same time, this must be done without having to exponentially increase infrastructure capacity demands. In this paper, we demonstrate the promising potential of Tensor Train decomposition for DLRMs (TT-Rec), an important yet under-investigated context. We design and implement optimized kernels (TT-EmbeddingBag) to evaluate the proposed TT-Rec design. TT-EmbeddingBag is 3 times faster than the SOTA TT implementation. The performance of TT-Rec is further optimized with the batched matrix multiplication and caching strategies for embedding vector lookup operations. In addition, we present mathematically and empirically the effect of weight initialization distribution on DLRM accuracy and propose to initialize the tensor cores of TT-Rec following the sampled Gaussian distribution. We evaluate TT-Rec across three important design space dimensions -- memory capacity, accuracy, and timing performance -- by training MLPerf-DLRM with Criteo's Kaggle and Terabyte data sets. TT-Rec achieves 117 times and 112 times model size compression, for Kaggle and Terabyte, respectively. This impressive model size reduction can come with no accuracy nor training time overhead as compared to the uncompressed baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-25\n\n\n\n#### 6. Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression language models\"*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Guokun Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension. The code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/laiguokun/Funnel-Transformer.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and analysis:\n\n## Test-Time Adaptation in Language Models\n- The concept of test-time adaptation is crucial for improving the performance of language models on diverse and unseen data. Papers like \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" discuss test-time fine-tuning, which involves fine-tuning the model parameters at test time specifically to each prompt. This approach has been shown to significantly improve language modeling ability, especially for underrepresented tasks.\n\n## Causal Convolution Implementations for Sequence Modeling\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss causal convolution implementations, the analysis note highlights the importance of efficient attention mechanisms. Causal convolutions can be integrated into sequence modeling to maintain the causal nature of autoregressive models. For example, models using gated linear attention (GLA) show promise in efficient sequence modeling[Analysis Note].\n\n## State Compression Techniques for Efficient Inference\n- State compression is essential for efficient inference in language models, particularly for handling long sequences. The analysis note mentions the trade-off between state size and recall ability, emphasizing the need for IO-aware algorithms to balance these factors[Analysis Note]. Techniques like those discussed in \"Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models\" could be adapted for state compression in autoregressive models.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-offs in Attention Mechanisms\n- The trade-offs between memory and computation in attention mechanisms are critical. Papers such as \"Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff\" highlight the importance of balancing state size and recall ability. These trade-offs can be managed through IO-aware implementations and hardware-specific optimizations[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration of Test-Time Training with Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Integrating test-time training with efficient attention mechanisms like GLA is an area that needs more research. The current sources do not provide direct examples, but combining the concepts of test-time fine-tuning with efficient attention mechanisms like GLA could be a promising direction.\n\n## Adaptive State Management in Language Models\n- Adaptive state management is vital for handling long sequences efficiently. Techniques such as those discussed in \"Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models\" and the use of gated linear attention can help in managing states adaptively[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Causal Convolutions\n- Hardware-efficient implementations are crucial for practical performance. While the sources do not specifically address causal convolutions, the emphasis on IO-aware algorithms and hardware-specific optimizations for linear attention mechanisms can be extended to causal convolutions. The analysis note highlights the importance of balancing parallelizability with memory movement for hardware efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Recommendations for Future Search\n\n- **Search for papers on causal convolution**: Look for research that specifically integrates causal convolutions into sequence modeling, possibly in the context of autoregressive models.\n- **Combine test-time training with GLA**: Investigate how test-time fine-tuning can be integrated with gated linear attention or similar efficient attention mechanisms.\n- **State compression and management**: Focus on techniques that optimize state size and recall ability, ensuring efficient inference for long sequences.\n- **Hardware efficiency**: Explore hardware-specific optimizations and IO-aware algorithms that can enhance the performance of causal convolution and linear attention mechanisms.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and adaptive autoregressive language model that leverages test-time training, efficient attention mechanisms, and state compression techniques.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient linear attention implementation\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Towards Efficient Image Compression Without Autoregressive Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"autoregressive model compression\"*\n\n*Muhammad Salman Ali, Yeong-Gwan Kim, Maryam Qamar, Sung-Chang Lim, Donghyun Kim, Chaoning Zhang, Sung-Ho Bae, Hui Yong Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel alternative to the AR-based approach that can provide a significantly better trade-off between performance and complexity and is proved to act as a general plug-in for the hyperprior (HP) based learned image compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learned image compression (LIC) has garnered increasing interest with its rapidly improving performance surpassing conventional codecs. A key ingredient of LIC is a hyperprior-based entropy model, where the underlying joint probability of the latent image features is modeled as a product of Gaussian distributions from each latent element. Since latents from the actual images are not spatially independent, autoregressive (AR) context based entropy models were proposed to handle the discrepancy between the assumed distribution and the actual distribution. Though the AR-based models have proven effective, the computational complexity is significantly increased due to the inherent sequential nature of the algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel alternative to the AR-based approach that can provide a significantly better trade-off between performance and complexity. To minimize the discrepancy, we introduce a correlation loss that forces the latents to be spatially decorrelated and better fitted to the independent probability model. Our correlation loss is proved to act as a general plug-in for the hyperprior (HP) based learned image compression methods. The performance gain from our correlation loss is \u2018free\u2019 in terms of computation complexity for both inference time and decoding time. To our knowledge, our method gives the best trade-off between the complexity and performance: combined with the Checkerboard-CM, it attains 90% and when combined with ChARM-CM, it attains 98% of the AR-based BD-Rate gains yet is around 50 times and 30 times faster than AR-based methods respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Joint Autoregressive and Hierarchical Priors for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"autoregressive model compression\"*\n\n*David C. Minnen, J. Ball\u00e9, G. Toderici*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders that learn approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent representation. The transforms are combined with an entropy model, which is a prior on the latent representation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to generate a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models were introduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than previous fully factorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining end-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in probabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, and combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in the context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive models can incur a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models. The combined model yields state-of-the-art rate\u2013distortion performance and generates smaller files than existing methods: 15.8% rate reductions over the baseline hierarchical model and 59.8%, 35%, and 8.4% savings over JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, respectively.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient linear attention implementation\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient linear attention implementation\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.

LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"autoregressive model compression\"*\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU\nmemory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify\nthe Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to\nalleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We\nintroduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that\nenables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and\ncomputational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a\nspecialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive\ngeneration algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method\ncompresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression\nratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within\na single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered\nan efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and\nposition identifiers to instill this compression capability.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text\n\n*From Search Query: \"autoregressive model compression\"*\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs)\nover highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by\na small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of\ncompression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally\ncompressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving\nefficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to\nthis goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are\nnot well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively\ncompressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome\nthis, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text\nis segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this\nmethod, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that\nimproves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on\nperplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse\nperplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter\ncount, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths\nrequire fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we\nprovide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability,\nand offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\nhigh-compression tokenizers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-04T17:48:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-13T22:01:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient attention\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Channel-wise Autoregressive Entropy Models for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"autoregressive model compression\"*\n\n*David Minnen, Saurabh Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** In learning-based approaches to image compression, codecs are developed by optimizing a computational model to minimize a rate-distortion objective. Currently, the most effective learned image codecs take the form of an entropy-constrained autoencoder with an entropy model that uses both forward and backward adaptation. Forward adaptation makes use of side information and can be efficiently integrated into a deep neural network. In contrast, backward adaptation typically makes predictions based on the causal context of each symbol, which requires serial processing that prevents efficient GPU / TPU utilization. We introduce two enhancements, channel-conditioning and latent residual prediction, that lead to network architectures with better rate-distortion performance than existing context-adaptive models while minimizing serial processing. Empirically, we see an average rate savings of 6.7% on the Kodak image set and 11.4% on the Tecnick image set compared to a context-adaptive baseline model. At low bit rates, where the improvements are most effective, our model saves up to 18% over the baseline and outperforms hand-engineered codecs like BPG by up to 25%.\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 3.
