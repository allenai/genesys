Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Score: 0.67)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. RNNs Can Generate Bounded Hierarchical Languages with Optimal Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*John Hewitt, Michael Hahn, S. Ganguli, Percy Liang, Christopher D.

However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN. We make our codes publicly available 2 .\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1086  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

Hierarchical Memory Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that\ncan be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed\nin a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with\nbackpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for\napplications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.\nOn the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on\nreinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we\nexplore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a\nhybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized\nin a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less\ncomputation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to\ntrain than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to\nincorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference\nprocedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various\nstate-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on\nSimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions\nof intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and\nbetter generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the\neffectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a\nstep further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that\nthe success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find\nthat the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward\nnormalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,\nwe find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase\nthe risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a\nsimple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain\noutperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art\nperformance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem,\nwe propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by\nreplacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments\nshow that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of\neight datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Rob van der Goot, Gertjan van Noord*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and\nefficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is\nthe task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical\ndomain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed\nmodel is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is\nresponsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important\ngeneration modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings\nmodule. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup\nlist can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to\nrank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of\nnormaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the\ngeneration modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an\nimportant source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the\nstate-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,\nwhich all define the task of normalization slightly different.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z  (*Updated: 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Associative Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Dmitry Krotov*\n\n**Abstract:** Dense Associative Memories or Modern Hopfield Networks have many appealing properties of associative memory. They can do pattern completion, store a large number of memories, and can be described using a recurrent neural network with a degree of biological plausibility and rich feedback between the neurons. At the same time, up until now all the models of this class have had only one hidden layer, and have only been formulated with densely connected network architectures, two aspects that hinder their machine learning applications. This paper tackles this gap and describes a fully recurrent model of associative memory with an arbitrary large number of layers, some of which can be locally connected (convolutional), and a corresponding energy function that decreases on the dynamical trajectory of the neurons' activations. The memories of the full network are dynamically \"assembled\" using primitives encoded in the synaptic weights of the lower layers, with the \"assembling rules\" encoded in the synaptic weights of the higher layers. In addition to the bottom-up propagation of information, typical of commonly used feedforward neural networks, the model described has rich top-down feedback from higher layers that help the lower-layer neurons to decide on their response to the input stimuli.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jun-Yan Zhu, Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Taesung Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Francisco Massa, Matthijs Douze, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical memory structures, adaptive normalization techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and references that can be beneficial:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Structures\n- The concept of hierarchical memory can significantly enhance state tracking and information flow in language models. The \"MemTree\" algorithm, for instance, organizes memory hierarchically using a dynamic, tree-structured representation. Each node in the tree encapsulates aggregated textual content, semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels, which helps in optimizing the organization, retrieval, and integration of information.\n- Another approach involves exploiting fragment-level relations in the external memory of large language models. The \"FragRel\" method hierarchically manages long text by considering the structural connections between text fragments, which improves the model's capability to handle texts with intensive inter-relations.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n- Adaptive normalization can be crucial for optimizing computational and memory efficiency. For example, the \"AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear\" approach incorporates dynamic sparsity and state compression, which can efficiently process long sequences by adapting the model's parameters based on the input data (though not directly mentioned, the concept aligns with adaptive mechanisms).\n- Adaptive sparsity can also be applied in attention mechanisms. A study on near-lossless acceleration of long context LLM inference with adaptive structured sparse attention highlights the benefits of dynamic sparsity in reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance (conceptually similar, though the specific reference is not provided here).\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Traditional attention mechanisms can be inefficient for long sequences. Alternatives such as \"Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions\" (TaLK Convolutions) offer efficient sequence encoding with linear complexity, which can improve scalability and reduce computational overhead (Lioutas and Guo, 2020).\n- Another approach is the use of matrix mixers, as seen in the \"Hydra\" model. This bidirectional extension of the Mamba model uses generalized matrix mixers to improve expressivity and efficiency in sequence modeling (Hwang et al., 2024).\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n- **Hierarchical Gating and Memory**: Hierarchical gating and memory structures, such as those proposed in HierarchicalGatedFastTTTLinear, can enhance state tracking and information flow by selectively managing the flow of information through the model (conceptually similar).\n- **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Adaptive sparsity and compression can optimize computational and memory efficiency, making the model more efficient for long-sequence processing.\n- **Efficient Attention**: Exploring alternatives to traditional attention, such as TaLK Convolutions or matrix mixers, can reduce complexity and improve scalability.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n- Conduct further searches on recent advancements in hierarchical memory structures, such as the MemTree algorithm and FragRel method.\n- Investigate recent papers on adaptive normalization techniques, particularly those that incorporate dynamic sparsity and state compression.\n- Explore efficient attention mechanisms, including TaLK Convolutions and matrix mixer models, to refine the proposal.\n\n## References\n- **MemTree**: Rezazadeh, A.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\n2024.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. RNNs Can Generate Bounded Hierarchical Languages with Optimal Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*John Hewitt, Michael Hahn, S. Ganguli, Percy Liang, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dyck- is introduced, the language of well-nested brackets and nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax, and it is proved that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks empirically generate natural language with high syntactic fidelity. However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1086  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

Hierarchical Memory Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that\ncan be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed\nin a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with\nbackpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for\napplications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.\nOn the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on\nreinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we\nexplore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a\nhybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized\nin a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less\ncomputation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to\ntrain than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to\nincorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference\nprocedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various\nstate-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on\nSimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions\nof intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and\nbetter generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the\neffectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a\nstep further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that\nthe success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find\nthat the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward\nnormalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,\nwe find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase\nthe risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a\nsimple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain\noutperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art\nperformance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem,\nwe propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by\nreplacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments\nshow that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of\neight datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Rob van der Goot, Gertjan van Noord*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and\nefficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is\nthe task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical\ndomain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed\nmodel is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is\nresponsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important\ngeneration modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings\nmodule. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup\nlist can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to\nrank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of\nnormaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the\ngeneration modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an\nimportant source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the\nstate-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,\nwhich all define the task of normalization slightly different.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z  (*Updated: 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Associative Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Dmitry Krotov*\n\n**Abstract:** Dense Associative Memories or Modern Hopfield Networks have many appealing properties of associative memory. They can do pattern completion, store a large number of memories, and can be described using a recurrent neural network with a degree of biological plausibility and rich feedback between the neurons. At the same time, up until now all the models of this class have had only one hidden layer, and have only been formulated with densely connected network architectures, two aspects that hinder their machine learning applications. This paper tackles this gap and describes a fully recurrent model of associative memory with an arbitrary large number of layers, some of which can be locally connected (convolutional), and a corresponding energy function that decreases on the dynamical trajectory of the neurons' activations. The memories of the full network are dynamically \"assembled\" using primitives encoded in the synaptic weights of the lower layers, with the \"assembling rules\" encoded in the synaptic weights of the higher layers. In addition to the bottom-up propagation of information, typical of commonly used feedforward neural networks, the model described has rich top-down feedback from higher layers that help the lower-layer neurons to decide on their response to the input stimuli.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jun-Yan Zhu, Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Taesung Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on hierarchical memory structures, adaptive normalization techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms is crucial.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1086  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

Hierarchical Memory Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that\ncan be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed\nin a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with\nbackpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for\napplications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.\nOn the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on\nreinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we\nexplore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a\nhybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized\nin a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less\ncomputation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to\ntrain than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to\nincorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference\nprocedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various\nstate-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on\nSimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions\nof intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and\nbetter generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the\neffectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a\nstep further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that\nthe success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find\nthat the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward\nnormalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,\nwe find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase\nthe risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a\nsimple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain\noutperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art\nperformance on En-Vi machine translation.

MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Rob van der Goot, Gertjan van Noord*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and\nefficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is\nthe task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical\ndomain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed\nmodel is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is\nresponsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important\ngeneration modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings\nmodule. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup\nlist can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to\nrank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of\nnormaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the\ngeneration modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an\nimportant source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the\nstate-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,\nwhich all define the task of normalization slightly different.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z  (*Updated: 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Associative Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Dmitry Krotov*\n\n**Abstract:** Dense Associative Memories or Modern Hopfield Networks have many appealing properties of associative memory. They can do pattern completion, store a large number of memories, and can be described using a recurrent neural network with a degree of biological plausibility and rich feedback between the neurons. At the same time, up until now all the models of this class have had only one hidden layer, and have only been formulated with densely connected network architectures, two aspects that hinder their machine learning applications. This paper tackles this gap and describes a fully recurrent model of associative memory with an arbitrary large number of layers, some of which can be locally connected (convolutional), and a corresponding energy function that decreases on the dynamical trajectory of the neurons' activations. The memories of the full network are dynamically \"assembled\" using primitives encoded in the synaptic weights of the lower layers, with the \"assembling rules\" encoded in the synaptic weights of the higher layers. In addition to the bottom-up propagation of information, typical of commonly used feedforward neural networks, the model described has rich top-down feedback from higher layers that help the lower-layer neurons to decide on their response to the input stimuli.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jun-Yan Zhu, Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Taesung Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Francisco Massa, Matthijs Douze, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on hierarchical memory structures, adaptive normalization techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms is crucial. Here are some key findings and recommendations based on the provided keywords and details:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\n### FragRel\nThe paper \"FragRel: Exploiting Fragment-level Relations in the External Memory of Large Language Models\" introduces a hierarchical memory structure that exploits fragment-level relations in the external memory of large language models. This approach enhances the model's capability to handle texts with intensive inter-relations, such as coherent stories and code repositories, by formulating and assessing fragment-level relations and integrating them into a hierarchical memory-based LLM.\n\n### MemTree\nWhile the provided sources do not explicitly mention MemTree, it is important to investigate similar hierarchical memory structures. MemTree, if similar to FragRel, would likely involve organizing memory in a hierarchical manner to efficiently manage long contexts and complex inter-relations. Future research should compare and contrast different hierarchical memory structures to identify the most effective approach.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n### AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, adaptive normalization techniques like those in AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear are crucial for optimizing computational and memory efficiency. These techniques dynamically adjust parameters based on input data, which can significantly improve the model's performance on long sequences. Further research should explore how these techniques can be integrated into existing autoregressive language models to enhance their efficiency.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### TaLK Convolutions and Matrix Mixers\nEfficient attention mechanisms such as TaLK Convolutions and matrix mixers (e.g., in the Hydra model) offer scalable alternatives to traditional attention. These mechanisms reduce computational complexity and improve performance, making them suitable for larger models and longer sequences. For example, the Loki method ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, which maintains model efficacy while reducing compute costs.\n\n### Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\nThe work on \"Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\" eliminates MatMul operations from LLMs, which reduces memory usage and improves efficiency. This approach can be combined with efficient attention mechanisms to further enhance the model's performance and scalability.\n\n## Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\n### Hierarchical Memory\n- Investigate the implementation details and performance metrics of hierarchical memory structures like FragRel and MemTree.\n- Compare the effectiveness of different hierarchical memory structures in handling long contexts and complex inter-relations.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization\n- Explore additional adaptive normalization techniques and their applications in language models.\n- Investigate how these techniques can be integrated into existing architectures to optimize computational and memory efficiency.\n\n### Efficient Attention\n- Examine more efficient attention mechanisms, such as TaLK Convolutions, matrix mixers, and low-rank key methods like Loki.\n- Integrate these mechanisms into existing architectures to reduce computational complexity and improve scalability.\n\n## References\n\n- Xihang Yue, Linchao Zhu, and Yi Yang. 2024.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\n2024.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. RNNs Can Generate Bounded Hierarchical Languages with Optimal Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*John Hewitt, Michael Hahn, S. Ganguli, Percy Liang, Christopher D.

However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1086  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

Hierarchical Memory Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Sarath Chandar, Sungjin Ahn, Hugo Larochelle, Pascal Vincent, Gerald Tesauro, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that\ncan be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed\nin a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with\nbackpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for\napplications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.\nOn the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on\nreinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we\nexplore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a\nhybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized\nin a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less\ncomputation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to\ntrain than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to\nincorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference\nprocedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various\nstate-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on\nSimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2016-05-24T12:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions\nof intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and\nbetter generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the\neffectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a\nstep further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that\nthe success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find\nthat the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward\nnormalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,\nwe find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase\nthe risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a\nsimple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain\noutperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art\nperformance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem,\nwe propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by\nreplacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments\nshow that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of\neight datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Rob van der Goot, Gertjan van Noord*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and\nefficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is\nthe task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical\ndomain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed\nmodel is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is\nresponsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important\ngeneration modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings\nmodule. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup\nlist can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to\nrank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of\nnormaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the\ngeneration modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an\nimportant source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the\nstate-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,\nwhich all define the task of normalization slightly different.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z  (*Updated: 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing\nknowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing\nefficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-22T19:19:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Associative Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory*\n\n*Dmitry Krotov*\n\n**Abstract:** Dense Associative Memories or Modern Hopfield Networks have many appealing properties of associative memory. They can do pattern completion, store a large number of memories, and can be described using a recurrent neural network with a degree of biological plausibility and rich feedback between the neurons. At the same time, up until now all the models of this class have had only one hidden layer, and have only been formulated with densely connected network architectures, two aspects that hinder their machine learning applications. This paper tackles this gap and describes a fully recurrent model of associative memory with an arbitrary large number of layers, some of which can be locally connected (convolutional), and a corresponding energy function that decreases on the dynamical trajectory of the neurons' activations. The memories of the full network are dynamically \"assembled\" using primitives encoded in the synaptic weights of the lower layers, with the \"assembling rules\" encoded in the synaptic weights of the higher layers. In addition to the bottom-up propagation of information, typical of commonly used feedforward neural networks, the model described has rich top-down feedback from higher layers that help the lower-layer neurons to decide on their response to the input stimuli.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jun-Yan Zhu, Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Taesung Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Francisco Massa, Matthijs Douze, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on hierarchical memory structures, adaptive normalization techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms is crucial. Here are some key findings and references that can help achieve this goal:\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\n- **FragRel**: The \"FragRel: Exploiting Fragment-level Relations in the External Memory of Large Language Models\" paper introduces a hierarchical memory structure that exploits fragment-level relations in the external memory. This approach enhances the model's capability to handle texts with intensive inter-relations, such as coherent stories and code repositories, by formulating and assessing fragment-level relations and integrating them into a hierarchical memory-based LLM.\n\n- **MemTree**: While the provided sources do not explicitly mention MemTree, it is implied that hierarchical memory structures like MemTree and FragRel can significantly improve state tracking and information flow, especially for tasks involving long contexts or complex inter-relations. Further investigation into MemTree's implementation details and performance metrics would be beneficial.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- **AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, adaptive normalization techniques like those in AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear can dynamically adjust parameters based on input data, optimizing computational and memory efficiency. This is a promising area to explore further, as it can lead to more efficient processing of long sequences.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **TaLK Convolutions and Matrix Mixers**: Efficient attention mechanisms such as TaLK Convolutions and matrix mixers (e.g., in the Hydra model) offer scalable alternatives to traditional attention. These mechanisms reduce computational complexity and improve performance, making them suitable for large-scale language models.\n\n- **Loki**: The \"Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention\" method ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. This approach maintains model efficacy while reducing computational costs, which is particularly useful for efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n### Additional Insights and References\n\n- **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling**: This work eliminates MatMul operations from LLMs, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency. This could be integrated with hierarchical memory structures and efficient attention mechanisms to further enhance model performance.\n\n- **HGRN2**: The state expansion mechanism in HGRN2 enhances expressiveness without adding additional parameters. This could be explored in conjunction with hierarchical memory and adaptive normalization to improve overall model efficiency and performance.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **Implementation Details of Hierarchical Memory**:\n   - Further investigate the implementation details and performance metrics of hierarchical memory structures like MemTree and FragRel. This includes understanding how fragment-level relations are formulated and assessed, and how these structures impact state tracking and information flow.\n\n2. **Adaptive Normalization Techniques**:\n   - Explore additional adaptive normalization techniques and their applications in language models. This could involve studying how different normalization methods adapt to input data and their impact on computational and memory efficiency.\n\n3. **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Examine more efficient attention mechanisms and their integration into existing architectures. This includes delving deeper into methods like TaLK Convolutions, matrix mixers, and low-rank key selection as in Loki.\n\n4. **Integration and Performance Evaluation**:\n   - Evaluate the performance of models that integrate hierarchical memory structures, adaptive normalization techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms. This would involve comparing perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, and overall efficiency in training and inference.\n\n### References\n\n- Xihang Yue, Linchao Zhu, and Yi Yang. 2024.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently. Please see Tiezzi et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.43)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated feed-forward networks*\n\n*Noam M. Shazeer, Azalia Mirhoseini, Krzysztof Maziarz, Andy Davis, Quoc V. Le, Geoffrey E. Hinton, J. Dean*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks, and applies the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.\n\n**Abstract:** The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 2038  (*Influential: 257*)\n\n#### 2. Parallel Training of GRU Networks with a Multi-Grid Solver for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated feed-forward networks*\n\n*G. Moon, E. Cyr*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel parallel training scheme (called parallel-in-time) for GRU based on a multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) solver, which achieves significant performance improvement as the sequence length increases.\n\n**Abstract:** Parallelizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks is a challenging task, as the training procedure of GRU is inherently sequential. Prior efforts to parallelize GRU have largely focused on conventional parallelization strategies such as data-parallel and model-parallel training algorithms. However, when the given sequences are very long, existing approaches are still inevitably performance limited in terms of training time. In this paper, we present a novel parallel training scheme (called parallel-in-time) for GRU based on a multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) solver. MGRIT partitions a sequence into multiple shorter sub-sequences and trains the sub-sequences on different processors in parallel. The key to achieving speedup is a hierarchical correction of the hidden state to accelerate end-to-end communication in both the forward and backward propagation phases of gradient descent. Experimental results on the HMDB51 dataset, where each video is an image sequence, demonstrate that the new parallel training scheme achieves up to 6.5$\\times$ speedup over a serial approach. As efficiency of our new parallelization strategy is associated with the sequence length, our parallel GRU algorithm achieves significant performance improvement as the sequence length increases.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hyperbolic Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated feed-forward networks*\n\n*O. Ganea, Gary B\u00e9cigneul, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work combines the formalism of Mobius gyrovector spaces with the Riemannian geometry of the Poincare model of hyperbolic spaces to derivehyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as gated recurrent units.\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained momentum in the context of machine learning due to their high capacity and tree-likeliness properties. However, the representational power of hyperbolic geometry is not yet on par with Euclidean geometry, mostly because of the absence of corresponding hyperbolic neural network layers. This makes it hard to use hyperbolic embeddings in downstream tasks. Here, we bridge this gap in a principled manner by combining the formalism of Mobius gyrovector spaces with the Riemannian geometry of the Poincare model of hyperbolic spaces. As a result, we derive hyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as gated recurrent units. This allows to embed sequential data and perform classification in the hyperbolic space. Empirically, we show that, even if hyperbolic optimization tools are limited, hyperbolic sentence embeddings either outperform or are on par with their Euclidean variants on textual entailment and noisy-prefix recognition tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 519  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Gating in Mixture-of-Experts based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamin Li, Qiang Su, Yitao Yang, Yimin Jiang, Cong Wang, Hong-Yu Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive gating in MoE is introduced, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution that preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have demonstrated exceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for scaling models while maintaining a constant number of computational operations. Existing MoE model adopts a fixed gating network where each token is computed by the same number of experts. However, this approach contradicts our intuition that the tokens in each sequence vary in terms of their linguistic complexity and, consequently, require different computational costs. Little is discussed in prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model performance. This paper introduces adaptive gating in MoE, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution. The proposed framework preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency. Additionally, curriculum learning is leveraged to further reduce training time. Extensive experiments on diverse NLP tasks show that adaptive gating reduces at most 22.5% training time while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the routing decisions and present our insights when adaptive gating is used.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Sangwon Yu, Jongyoon Song, Heeseung Kim, SeongEun Lee, Woo-Jong Ryu, Sung-Hoon Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study analyzes the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding and proposes a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating (AGG), which addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare tokenembeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have determined that the learned token embeddings of large-scale neural language models are degenerated to be anisotropic with a narrow-cone shape. This phenomenon, called the representation degeneration problem, facilitates an increase in the overall similarity between token embeddings that negatively affect the performance of the models. Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored. In this study, we analyze the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding. We demonstrate that the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings is the key cause of the degeneration problem for all tokens during training stage. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating(AGG). AGG addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings. Experimental results from language modeling, word similarity, and machine translation tasks quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of AGG.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Incorporating Effective Global Information via Adaptive Gate Attention\n  for Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Yingbin Zhao, Haoran Xie, Qing Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The dominant text classification studies focus on training classifiers using\ntextual instances only or introducing external knowledge (e.g., hand-craft\nfeatures and domain expert knowledge). In contrast, some corpus-level\nstatistical features, like word frequency and distribution, are not well\nexploited. Our work shows that such simple statistical information can enhance\nclassification performance both efficiently and significantly compared with\nseveral baseline models. In this paper, we propose a classifier with gate\nmechanism named Adaptive Gate Attention model with Global Information (AGA+GI),\nin which the adaptive gate mechanism incorporates global statistical features\ninto latent semantic features and the attention layer captures dependency\nrelationship within the sentence. To alleviate the overfitting issue, we\npropose a novel Leaky Dropout mechanism to improve generalization ability and\nperformance stability.

DEGAP: Dual Event-Guided Adaptive Prefixes for Templated-Based Event\n  Argument Extraction with Slot Querying\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Guanghui Wang, Dexi Liu, Jian-Yun Nie, Qizhi Wan, Rong Hu, Xiping Liu, Wanlong Liu, Jiaming Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating\nuseful auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as\nretrieved instances and event templates. These methods face two challenges: (1)\nthe retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed\nindependently for each event without considering their possible relationship.\nIn this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet\neffective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the\ninstance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn\ninformation from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we\npropose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively\nleverage possible connections between different events and thus capture\nrelevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes\nprovide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval.

Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated feed-forward networks*\n\n*Xin Yuan, Lishun Wang, Yulun Zhang, Ping Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving the inverse problem of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) for video, whose ill-posedness is rooted in the mixed degradation of spatial masking and temporal aliasing. However, previous Transformers lack an insight into the degradation and thus have limited performance and efficiency. In this work, we tailor an efficient reconstruction architecture without temporal aggregation in early layers and Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer (HiSViT) as building block. HiSViT is built by multiple groups of Cross-Scale Separable Multi-head Self-Attention (CSS-MSA) and Gated Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (GSM-FFN) with dense connections, each of which is conducted within a separate channel portions at a different scale, for multi-scale interactions and long-range modeling. By separating spatial operations from temporal ones, CSS-MSA introduces an inductive bias of paying more attention within frames instead of between frames while saving computational overheads. GSM-FFN further enhances the locality via gated mechanism and factorized spatial-temporal convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods by $\\!>\\!0.5$ dB with comparable or fewer parameters and complexity.

LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

A Combinatorial Perspective on Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive gating mechanisms*\n\n*Joel Veness, Marcus Hutter, David Budden, Eren Sezener, Jianan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence is characterized not only by the capacity to learn complex skills, but the ability to rapidly adapt and acquire new skills within an ever-changing environment. In this work we study how the learning of modular solutions can allow for effective generalization to both unseen and potentially differently distributed data. Our main postulate is that the combination of task segmentation, modular learning and memory-based ensembling can give rise to generalization on an exponentially growing number of unseen tasks. We provide a concrete instantiation of this idea using a combination of: (1) the Forget-Me-Not Process, for task segmentation and memory based ensembling; and (2) Gated Linear Networks, which in contrast to contemporary deep learning techniques use a modular and local learning mechanism. We demonstrate that this system exhibits a number of desirable continual learning properties: robustness to catastrophic forgetting, no negative transfer and increasing levels of positive transfer as more tasks are seen. We show competitive performance against both offline and online methods on standard continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel **HierarchicalAdaptiveGatedMLP** that enhances the existing GatedMLP architecture, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the analysis and search results:\n\n### Hierarchical Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN)**: The concept of hierarchical gating in recurrent neural networks, as seen in HGRN, can be adapted to feed-forward networks. This involves using gated mechanisms at multiple levels to capture dependencies at different timescales, which can improve state tracking and scalability in GatedMLP.\n\n- **Horizontal Gated-Recurrent Units (hGRU)**: The hGRU introduces horizontal connections to learn long-range dependencies, which can be a valuable inspiration for designing hierarchical gating in GatedMLP. Implementing bounded forget gates that increase monotonically across layers could enhance state tracking.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Layer Normalization and Adaptive Normalization**: Layer normalization has been shown to stabilize and accelerate training in recurrent neural networks. Adaptive normalization techniques, such as those proposed by Xu et al., can replace traditional bias and gain with dynamic transformations, potentially improving training stability and convergence speed in GatedMLP.\n\n- **Layer-Adaptive Position Embedding (LaPE)**: This method uses independent layer normalization to provide layer-adaptive and hierarchical positional embeddings, achieving superior performance in vision transformers. Similar techniques can be applied to GatedMLP to enhance its adaptiveness to varying feature distributions.\n\n### State Tracking and Hierarchical Memory\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: Recent work on SSMs, such as Longhorn and DenseMamba, highlights the importance of state tracking and hierarchical processing. These models optimize online regression objectives and integrate shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, which can inform the design of hierarchical memory structures in GatedMLP.\n\n### Implementation and Efficiency Considerations\n\n- **Complexity Management**: Integrating hierarchical gating and adaptive normalization will increase the complexity of the model. Efficient implementations, such as leveraging tensor operations and hardware acceleration, are crucial to manage this complexity without degrading performance.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: The use of advanced feature extraction techniques, such as those seen in the MHCFIN model (e.g., multi-attention mechanisms, residual connections), can introduce computational overhead. However, these techniques can also significantly enhance performance, and optimizing them is essential for real-time applications.\n\n### Potential Impact\n\n- **Accuracy and Robustness**: Enhancing GatedMLP with hierarchical gating and adaptive normalization can improve its ability to capture complex dependencies, potentially leading to better performance on language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: These enhancements can also lead to better resource utilization and facilitate scaling to longer sequences and larger models, making the model more efficient and scalable.\n\n### Relevant References and Concepts\n\n- **Hierarchical Gating**:\n  - Qin et al.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/63 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\n2023. [11] N. Chomsky.

However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2.

We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1086  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 5.

The challenge of adapting an anomaly detector to drift in the normal data distribution, especially when no training data is available for the\"new normal,\"has led to the development of zero-shot AD techniques. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Centered Representations (ACR) for zero-shot batch-level AD. Our approach trains off-the-shelf deep anomaly detectors (such as deep SVDD) to adapt to a set of inter-related training data distributions in combination with batch normalization, enabling automatic zero-shot generalization for unseen AD tasks. This simple recipe, batch normalization plus meta-training, is a highly effective and versatile tool. Our theoretical results guarantee the zero-shot generalization for unseen AD tasks; our empirical results demonstrate the first zero-shot AD results for tabular data and outperform existing methods in zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation on image data from specialized domains.

Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization techniques*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN. We make our codes publicly available 2 .\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7. Practical Large-Scale Linear Programming using Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient\n\n*From Search Query: GatedMLP enhancements*\n\n*D. Applegate, M. D'iaz, Oliver Hinder, Haihao Lu, Miles Lubin, Brendan O'Donoghue, W. Schudy*\n\n**TL;DR:** PDLP improves the state of the art for first-order methods applied to LP by combining several new techniques with older tricks from the literature; the enhancements include diagonal preconditioning, presolving, adaptive step sizes, and adaptive restarting.\n\n**Abstract:** We present PDLP, a practical first-order method for linear programming (LP) that can solve to the high levels of accuracy that are expected in traditional LP applications. In addition, it can scale to very large problems because its core operation is matrix-vector multiplications. PDLP is derived by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, popularized by Chambolle and Pock (2011), to a saddle-point formulation of LP. PDLP enhances PDHG for LP by combining several new techniques with older tricks from the literature; the enhancements include diagonal preconditioning, presolving, adaptive step sizes, and adaptive restarting. PDLP improves the state of the art for first-order methods applied to LP. We compare PDLP with SCS, an ADMM-based solver, on a set of 383 LP instances derived from MIPLIB 2017. With a target of $10^{-8}$ relative accuracy and 1 hour time limit, PDLP achieves a 6.3x reduction in the geometric mean of solve times and a 4.6x reduction in the number of instances unsolved (from 227 to 49). Furthermore, we highlight standard benchmark instances and a large-scale application (PageRank) where our open-source prototype of PDLP, written in Julia, outperforms a commercial LP solver.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 8. Knowledge Distillation as Semiparametric Inference\n\n*From Search Query: GatedMLP enhancements*\n\n*Tri Dao, G. Kamath, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Lester W. Mackey*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work derives new guarantees for the prediction error of standard distillation and develops two enhancements -- cross-fitting and loss correction -- to mitigate the impact of teacher overfitting and underfitting on student performance.\n\n**Abstract:** A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model. Surprisingly, this two-step knowledge distillation process often leads to higher accuracy than training the student directly on labeled data. To explain and enhance this phenomenon, we cast knowledge distillation as a semiparametric inference problem with the optimal student model as the target, the unknown Bayes class probabilities as nuisance, and the teacher probabilities as a plug-in nuisance estimate. By adapting modern semiparametric tools, we derive new guarantees for the prediction error of standard distillation and develop two enhancements -- cross-fitting and loss correction -- to mitigate the impact of teacher overfitting and underfitting on student performance. We validate our findings empirically on both tabular and image data and observe consistent improvements from our knowledge distillation enhancements.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9. How Does Fine-tuning Affect the Geometry of Embedding Space: A Case Study on Isotropy\n\n*From Search Query: GatedMLP enhancements*\n\n*S. Rajaee, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that, even though isotropy is a desirable geometrical property, fine-tuning does not necessarily result in isotropy enhancements, making existing isotropy enhancement methods ineffective.\n\n**Abstract:** It is widely accepted that fine-tuning pre-trained language models usually brings about performance improvements in downstream tasks. However, there are limited studies on the reasons behind this effectiveness, particularly from the viewpoint of structural changes in the embedding space. Trying to fill this gap, in this paper, we analyze the extent to which the isotropy of the embedding space changes after fine-tuning. We demonstrate that, even though isotropy is a desirable geometrical property, fine-tuning does not necessarily result in isotropy enhancements. Moreover, local structures in pre-trained contextual word representations (CWRs), such as those encoding token types or frequency, undergo a massive change during fine-tuning. Our experiments show dramatic growth in the number of elongated directions in the embedding space, which, in contrast to pre-trained CWRs, carry the essential linguistic knowledge in the fine-tuned embedding space, making existing isotropy enhancement methods ineffective.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory neural networks*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Distributed Hierarchical GPU Parameter Server for Massive Scale Deep Learning Ads Systems\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory neural networks*\n\n*Weijie Zhao, Deping Xie, Yulei Qian, Ruiquan Ding, Mingming Sun, Ronglai Jia, Ping Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks of ads systems usually take input from multiple resources, e.g., query-ad relevance, ad features and user portraits. These inputs are encoded into one-hot or multi-hot binary features, with typically only a tiny fraction of nonzero feature values per example. Deep learning models in online advertising industries can have terabyte-scale parameters that do not fit in the GPU memory nor the CPU main memory on a computing node. For example, a sponsored online advertising system can contain more than $10^{11}$ sparse features, making the neural network a massive model with around 10 TB parameters. In this paper, we introduce a distributed GPU hierarchical parameter server for massive scale deep learning ads systems. We propose a hierarchical workflow that utilizes GPU High-Bandwidth Memory, CPU main memory and SSD as 3-layer hierarchical storage. All the neural network training computations are contained in GPUs. Extensive experiments on real-world data confirm the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed system. A 4-node hierarchical GPU parameter server can train a model more than 2X faster than a 150-node in-memory distributed parameter server in an MPI cluster. In addition, the price-performance ratio of our proposed system is 4-9 times better than an MPI-cluster solution.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization techniques*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization techniques*\n\n*Karen Simonyan, Samuel L. Smith, Soham De, Andrew Brock*\n\n**Abstract:** Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models, but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89.2%.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

Deep Recursive Neural Networks for Compositionality in Language\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feed-forward networks*\n\n*Ozan Irsoy, Claire Cardie*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that deep RNNs outperform associated shallow counterparts that employ the same number of parameters and outperforms previous baselines on the sentiment analysis task, including a multiplicative RNN variant as well as the recently introduced paragraph vectors.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursive neural networks comprise a class of architecture that can operate on structured input. They have been previously successfully applied to model com-positionality in natural language using parse-tree-based structural representations. Even though these architectures are deep in structure, they lack the capacity for hierarchical representation that exists in conventional deep feed-forward networks as well as in recently investigated deep recurrent neural networks. In this work we introduce a new architecture \u2014 a deep recursive neural network (deep RNN) \u2014 constructed by stacking multiple recursive layers. We evaluate the proposed model on the task of fine-grained sentiment classification. Our results show that deep RNNs outperform associated shallow counterparts that employ the same number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach outperforms previous baselines on the sentiment analysis task, including a multiplicative RNN variant as well as the recently introduced paragraph vectors, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We provide exploratory analyses of the effect of multiple layers and show that they capture different aspects of compositionality in language.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 294  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Verification for Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feed-forward networks*\n\n*Cong Han Lim, R. Urtasun, Ersin Yumer*\n\n**TL;DR:** The LayerCert framework considers the nested hyperplane arrangement induced by the layers of the ReLU network and explores regions in a hierarchical manner and provably reduces the number and size of the convex programs that one needs to solve compared to GeoCert.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new framework for the exact point-wise $\\ell_p$ robustness verification problem that exploits the layer-wise geometric structure of deep feed-forward networks with rectified linear activations (ReLU networks). The activation regions of the network partition the input space, and one can verify the $\\ell_p$ robustness around a point by checking all the activation regions within the desired radius. The GeoCert algorithm (Jordan et al., NeurIPS 2019) treats this partition as a generic polyhedral complex in order to detect which region to check next. In contrast, our LayerCert framework considers the \\emph{nested hyperplane arrangement} structure induced by the layers of the ReLU network and explores regions in a hierarchical manner. We show that, under certain conditions on the algorithm parameters, LayerCert provably reduces the number and size of the convex programs that one needs to solve compared to GeoCert. Furthermore, our LayerCert framework allows the incorporation of lower bounding routines based on convex relaxations to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LayerCert can significantly reduce both the number of convex programs solved and the running time over the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Cross-channel Communication Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feed-forward networks*\n\n*Jianwei Yang, Zhile Ren, Chuang Gan, Hongyuan Zhu, Devi Parikh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel network unit called Cross-channel Communication (C3) block, a simple yet effective module to encourage the neuron communication within the same layer to outperform baseline deep networks and other competitive methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks process input data by sending channel-wise feature response maps to subsequent layers. While a lot of progress has been made by making networks deeper, information from each channel can only be propagated from lower levels to higher levels in a hierarchical feed-forward manner. When viewing each filter in the convolutional layer as a neuron, those neurons are not communicating explicitly within each layer in CNNs. We introduce a novel network unit called Cross-channel Communication (C3) block, a simple yet effective module to encourage the neuron communication within the same layer. The C3 block enables neurons to exchange information through a micro neural network, which consists of a feature encoder, a message communicator, and a feature decoder, before sending the information to the next layer. With C3 block, each neuron accounts for the channel-wise responses from other neurons at the same layer and learns more discriminative and complementary representations. Extensive experiments for multiple computer vision tasks show that our proposed mechanism allows shallower networks to aggregate useful information within each layer, and performances outperform baseline deep networks and other competitive methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 261  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP*\n\n*F. Yu, V. Koltun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction, and shows that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations of convolutional networks that had originally been designed for image classification. However, dense prediction and image classification are structurally different. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 7975  (*Influential: 471*)\n\n#### 6. MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Weakly-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation with SAM-based Pseudo Labeling and Multi-scale Feature Grouping\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP*\n\n*Chunming He, Kai Li, Yachao Zhang, Guoxia Xu, Longxiang Tang, Yulun Zhang, Z. Guo, Xiu Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images.\n\n**Abstract:** Weakly-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (WSCOS) aims to segment objects well blended with surrounding environments using sparsely-annotated data for model training. It remains a challenging task since (1) it is hard to distinguish concealed objects from the background due to the intrinsic similarity and (2) the sparsely-annotated training data only provide weak supervision for model learning. In this paper, we propose a new WSCOS method to address these two challenges. To tackle the intrinsic similarity challenge, we design a multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results. By grouping similar features together, it encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images. For the weak supervision challenge, we utilize the recently-proposed vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and use the provided sparse annotations as prompts to generate segmentation masks, which are used to train the model. To alleviate the impact of low-quality segmentation masks, we further propose a series of strategies, including multi-augmentation result ensemble, entropy-based pixel-level weighting, and entropy-based image-level selection. These strategies help provide more reliable supervision to train the segmentation model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on various WSCOS tasks, and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feed-forward networks*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, several key aspects and insights can be gleaned from the provided analysis and search results.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\n- The concept of hierarchical memory is often explored in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but adapting it to feed-forward networks like GatedMLP is a novel approach. The work on **Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks** by Chung et al. (2017) provides a foundation for understanding how hierarchical structures can capture dependencies at multiple timescales, which could be adapted for feed-forward architectures.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- Adaptive normalization is crucial for improving training stability and performance. The paper by Ba et al. (2016) on **Layer Normalization** is a cornerstone in this area, and recent works like **Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting** by Liu et al. (2023) suggest dynamic adjustments based on input characteristics, which could be integrated into GatedMLP.\n\n### Integration with GatedMLP\n\n- The **GLU Variants Improve Transformer** paper by Shazeer (2020) shows how gating mechanisms can enhance feed-forward networks. Combining this with hierarchical memory and adaptive normalization could significantly improve the GatedMLP unit. The **DenseMamba** approach, which integrates shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, offers a conceptual framework for hierarchical state management in feed-forward networks.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The hierarchical training algorithm proposed in the arXiv paper on **Towards optimal hierarchical training of neural networks** suggests a method to extend network architecture adaptively, which could be applied to ensure that the GatedMLP unit scales efficiently without compromising performance. This approach ensures that the network achieves quasi-optimal loss with a given number of parameters, which is crucial for scalability.\n\n### Structural Complexity and Performance\n\n- The study on **Correlating measures of hierarchical structures in artificial neural networks** using the Ladderpath approach indicates that networks with richer hierarchical structures tend to perform better. This suggests that incorporating hierarchical structures into the GatedMLP unit could lead to superior performance, as it aligns with the hypothesis that higher structural complexity correlates with optimal functionality.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Hierarchical State Tracking**:\n   - Implement hierarchical memory structures within the GatedMLP unit, similar to how **DenseMamba** integrates information across layers. This can enhance the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies.\n\n2. **Adaptive Normalization**:\n   - Integrate adaptive normalization techniques, such as those described in **Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting**, to adjust parameters based on input characteristics. This can improve training stability and performance.\n\n3. **Efficient Implementation**:\n   - Use the hierarchical training algorithm to extend the network architecture adaptively, ensuring that the model scales efficiently without compromising performance. This approach can help manage complexity and improve generalization error.\n\n4. **Structural Complexity**:\n   - Ensure that the hierarchical structure of the GatedMLP unit aligns with the findings from the Ladderpath approach, aiming for a structural complexity that corresponds to optimal functionality.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Architectures**:\n  - Search for recent works that might have attempted to integrate hierarchical or multi-scale processing into GatedMLP or similar feed-forward units.\n\n- **Adaptive Gating Mechanisms**:\n  - Investigate research on adaptive gating techniques that adjust gate parameters dynamically based on input, which could relate to adaptive normalization.\n\n- **Transformer Overlaps**:\n  - Examine whether hierarchical memory and adaptive normalization have been combined in Transformer-based architectures and assess whether those ideas can be adapted for GatedMLP.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages hierarchical memory, adaptive normalization, and efficient scaling, potentially outperforming current state-of-the-art models.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/97 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2404.05892, 2024.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated neural networks*\n\n*Jianwei Yang, Chunyuan Li, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision, exhibit clear superiority on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation.

Learning long-range spatial dependencies with horizontal gated-recurrent units\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated neural networks*\n\n*Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the horizontal gated-recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections -- both within and across feature columns, and demonstrates that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures which have orders of magnitude more free parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching -- and sometimes even surpassing -- human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Here, however, we show that these neural networks and their recent extensions struggle in recognition tasks where co-dependent visual features must be detected over long spatial ranges. We introduce the horizontal gated-recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections -- both within and across feature columns. We demonstrate that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures which have orders of magnitude more free parameters. We further discuss the biological plausibility of the hGRU in comparison to anatomical data from the visual cortex as well as human behavioral data on a classic contour detection task.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 3.

Ricci, Xiaogang Wang, N. Sebe*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical deep model is introduced which produces more rich and complementary representations and the novel Attention-Gated Conditional Random Fields (AG-CRFs) are proposed to refine and robustly fuse the representations learned at different scales.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have shown that exploiting multi-scale representations deeply learned via convolutional neural networks (CNN) is of tremendous importance for accurate contour detection. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting contours which advances the state of the art in two fundamental aspects, i.e. multi-scale feature generation and fusion. Different from previous works directly consider- ing multi-scale feature maps obtained from the inner layers of a primary CNN architecture, we introduce a hierarchical deep model which produces more rich and complementary representations. Furthermore, to refine and robustly fuse the representations learned at different scales, the novel Attention-Gated Conditional Random Fields (AG-CRFs) are proposed. The experiments ran on two publicly available datasets (BSDS500 and NYUDv2) demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent AG-CRF model and of the overall hierarchical framework.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 112  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Temporal FiLM: Capturing Long-Range Sequence Dependencies with Feature-Wise Modulations\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization in feed-forward networks*\n\n*Sawyer Birnbaum, Volodymyr Kuleshov, S. Enam, Pang Wei Koh, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**TL;DR:** Temporal Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (TFiLM) is proposed, a novel architectural component inspired by adaptive batch normalization and its extensions that uses a recurrent neural network to alter the activations of a convolutional model.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning representations that accurately capture long-range dependencies in sequential inputs --- including text, audio, and genomic data --- is a key problem in deep learning. Feed-forward convolutional models capture only feature interactions within finite receptive fields while recurrent architectures can be slow and difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. Here, we propose Temporal Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (TFiLM) --- a novel architectural component inspired by adaptive batch normalization and its extensions --- that uses a recurrent neural network to alter the activations of a convolutional model. This approach expands the receptive field of convolutional sequence models with minimal computational overhead. Empirically, we find that TFiLM significantly improves the learning speed and accuracy of feed-forward neural networks on a range of generative and discriminative learning tasks, including text classification and audio super-resolution.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5.

Kahn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a reliable and very fast method for computing the associated spectral densities of Jacobians, and nuance the idea that learning happens at the edge of chaos by giving evidence that a very desirable feature for neural networks is the hyperbolicity of their Jacobian at initialization.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient descent during the learning process of a neural network can be subject to many instabilities. The spectral density of the Jacobian is a key component for analyzing stability. Following the works of Pennington et al., such Jacobians are modeled using free multiplicative convolutions from Free Probability Theory (FPT). We present a reliable and very fast method for computing the associated spectral densities, for given architecture and initialization. This method has a controlled and proven convergence. Our technique is based on an homotopy method: it is an adaptative Newton-Raphson scheme which chains basins of attraction. In order to demonstrate the relevance of our method we show that the relevant FPT metrics computed before training are highly correlated to final test accuracies - up to 85\\%. We also nuance the idea that learning happens at the edge of chaos by giving evidence that a very desirable feature for neural networks is the hyperbolicity of their Jacobian at initialization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Learning Neural Networks with Adaptive Regularization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization in feed-forward networks*\n\n*Han Zhao, Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, R. Salakhutdinov, Geoffrey J. Gordon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to construct a matrix-variate normal prior whose covariance matrix has a Kronecker product structure, designed to capture the correlations in neurons through backpropagation and verifies the effectiveness of the approach on multiclass classification and multitask regression problems with various network structures.\n\n**Abstract:** Feed-forward neural networks can be understood as a combination of an intermediate representation and a linear hypothesis. While most previous works aim to diversify the representations, we explore the complementary direction by performing an adaptive and data-dependent regularization motivated by the empirical Bayes method. Specifically, we propose to construct a matrix-variate normal prior (on weights) whose covariance matrix has a Kronecker product structure. This structure is designed to capture the correlations in neurons through backpropagation. Under the assumption of this Kronecker factorization, the prior encourages neurons to borrow statistical strength from one another. Hence, it leads to an adaptive and data-dependent regularization when training networks on small datasets. To optimize the model, we present an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm with analytical solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method helps networks converge to local optima with smaller stable ranks and spectral norms. These properties suggest better generalizations and we present empirical results to support this expectation. We also verify the effectiveness of the approach on multiclass classification and multitask regression problems with various network structures.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP architectures*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Searching for Efficient Multi-Scale Architectures for Dense Image Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP architectures*\n\n*Liang-Chieh Chen, Maxwell D. Collins, Yukun Zhu, G. Papandreou, Barret Zoph, Florian Schroff, Hartwig Adam, Jonathon Shlens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work constructs a recursive search space for meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing, person-part segmentation, and semantic image segmentation and demonstrates that even with efficient random search, this architecture can outperform human-invented architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** The design of neural network architectures is an important component for achieving state-of-the-art performance with machine learning systems across a broad array of tasks. Much work has endeavored to design and build architectures automatically through clever construction of a search space paired with simple learning algorithms. Recent progress has demonstrated that such meta-learning methods may exceed scalable human-invented architectures on image classification tasks. An open question is the degree to which such methods may generalize to new domains. In this work we explore the construction of meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing, person-part segmentation, and semantic image segmentation. Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image prediction, we construct a recursive search space and demonstrate that even with efficient random search, we can identify architectures that outperform human-invented architectures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three dense prediction tasks including 82.7% on Cityscapes (street scene parsing), 71.3% on PASCAL-Person-Part (person-part segmentation), and 87.9% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (semantic image segmentation). Additionally, the resulting architecture is more computationally efficient, requiring half the parameters and half the computational cost as previous state of the art systems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 394  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 9. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale GatedMLP architectures*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. A new hazard event classification model via deep learning and\n  multifractal\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated neural networks*\n\n*Zhenhua Wang, Bin Wang, Ming Ren, Dong Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) is the paradigm of industrial safety\nthat can reveal the hazards of process from its node deviations, consequences,\ncauses, measures and suggestions, and such hazards can be considered as hazard\nevents (HaE). The classification research on HaE has much irreplaceable\npragmatic values. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning model termed\nDLF through multifractal to explore HaE classification where the motivation is\nthat HaE can be naturally regarded as a kind of time series. Specifically,\nfirst HaE is vectorized to get HaE time series by employing BERT. Then, a new\nmultifractal analysis method termed HmF-DFA is proposed to win HaE fractal\nseries by analyzing HaE time series. Finally, a new hierarchical gating neural\nnetwork (HGNN) is designed to process HaE fractal series to accomplish the\nclassification of HaE from three aspects: severity, possibility and risk. We\ntake HAZOP reports of 18 processes as cases, and launch the experiments on this\nbasis. Results demonstrate that compared with other classifiers, DLF classifier\nperforms better under metrics of precision, recall and F1-score, especially for\nthe severity aspect. Also, HmF-DFA and HGNN effectively promote HaE\nclassification. Our HaE classification system can serve application incentives\nto experts, engineers, employees, and other enterprises. We hope our research\ncan contribute added support to the daily practice in industrial safety.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-12T14:13:13Z  (*Updated: 2023-02-12T04:52:17Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling.\nRecently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling.\nThese linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Parallel-Data-Free Voice Conversion Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gated neural networks*\n\n*Hirokazu Kameoka, Takuhiro Kaneko*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a parallel-data-free voice-conversion (VC) method that can learn a\nmapping from source to target speech without relying on parallel data. The\nproposed method is general purpose, high quality, and parallel-data free and\nworks without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. It also avoids\nover-smoothing, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC\nmethods. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial\nnetwork (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an\nidentity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings\nsimultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it\npossible to find an optimal pseudo pair from unpaired data. Furthermore, the\nadversarial loss contributes to reducing over-smoothing of the converted\nfeature sequence. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an\nidentity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential\nand hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We\nevaluated our method on a parallel-data-free VC task. An objective evaluation\nshowed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global\nvariance and modulation spectra. A subjective evaluation showed that the\nquality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian\nmixture model-based method under advantageous conditions with parallel and\ntwice the amount of data.\n\n**Published:** 2017-11-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization in feed-forward networks*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization in feed-forward networks*\n\n*Serge Belongie, Xun Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content\nimage in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer.\nHowever, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which\nlimits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural\nnetworks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately,\nthe speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed\nset of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we\npresent a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables\narbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel\nadaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance\nof the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves\nspeed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a\npre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user\ncontrols such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial\ncontrols, all using a single feed-forward neural network.\n\n**Conference:** arbitrary-style-transfer-in-real-time-with-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, the **HierarchicalAdaptiveGatedMLP**, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the analysis and search results:\n\n## Hierarchical Gated Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of hierarchical gating, as seen in recurrent neural networks like HGRN and HGRN2, can be adapted to feed-forward architectures. These models use hierarchical gating mechanisms to capture dependencies at multiple timescales, which could be beneficial for sequence modeling in language models.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- Adaptive normalization methods, such as AdaNorm and Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN), have shown promise in various neural network models. These techniques allow for dynamic adjustment of normalization parameters based on input features, which can improve training stability and performance. Integrating such methods into the GatedMLP unit could enhance its adaptability and efficiency.\n\n## Integration into GatedMLP\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Structures**: Adapting hierarchical gating from RNNs to GatedMLP involves designing a feed-forward mechanism that simulates hierarchical state tracking. This could be achieved by stacking GatedMLP layers with residual connections and implementing gating mechanisms that operate at different hierarchical levels.\n- **Adaptive Normalization**: Implementing layer-adaptive normalization within GatedMLP, similar to LaPE or AdaNorm, can allow the model to adjust normalization parameters dynamically. This can improve the model's ability to handle varying input features and enhance overall performance.\n\n## Key Insights and Considerations\n\n- **Novelty and Feasibility**:\n  - The integration of hierarchical gating and adaptive normalization into GatedMLP is a novel approach that has not been extensively explored. This makes the HierarchicalAdaptiveGatedMLP a potentially groundbreaking contribution.\n  - However, it is crucial to address the increased architectural complexity and ensure that the additional computations do not degrade performance. Techniques like parameter sharing and efficient tensor operations can help mitigate this overhead.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations**:\n  - **Complexity Management**: Careful design is necessary to balance model expressiveness with computational overhead.\n  - **Computational Efficiency**: Optimizing the additional computations from hierarchical gating and adaptive normalization is essential to prevent performance degradation.\n  - **Scalability**: Hierarchical structures can enhance the model's ability to scale to longer sequences and larger datasets, which is critical for large language models.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\n- **Accuracy and Robustness**: Enhanced state tracking and adaptive normalization can improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns and long-term dependencies, leading to better performance on language modeling tasks and downstream applications.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Dynamic adjustment of parameters can lead to more efficient resource utilization, and hierarchical processing may enable the model to scale without proportional increases in computational cost.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Investigate Implementations of Hierarchical Gating in Feed-Forward Networks**:\n  - Search for recent studies or unpublished works that might have implemented hierarchical gating mechanisms in feed-forward architectures like GatedMLP.\n- **Explore Adaptive Gating Mechanisms**:\n  - Look for research on gating mechanisms that adjust based on input features, potentially offering insights into adaptive normalization within GatedMLP.\n- **Examine Cross-Model Adaptations**:\n  - Analyze whether ideas from RNNs or Transformers, such as hierarchical memory or adaptive normalization, can be effectively adapted to GatedMLP.\n\n## Relevant References\n\n- **Qin et al.
