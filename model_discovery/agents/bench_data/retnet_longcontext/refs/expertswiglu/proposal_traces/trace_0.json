Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1312.4461, 2013.

Model: https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/Jamba-v0.1\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWe introduce Jamba, a new publicly available large language model. Jamba is based on a novel hybrid architecture, which combines Transformer layers [51] with Mamba layers [17], a recent state-space model [18, 19], as well as a mixture-of-experts (MoE) module [14, 46]. Jamba thus combines two orthogonal architectural designs that together give it improved performance and higher throughput, while maintaining a manageable memory footprint. The 7B-based Jamba model (12B active parameters, 52B total available parameters) we are releasing was designed to fit in a single 80GB GPU, but the Jamba architecture supports other design choices, depending on one's hardware and performance requirements. [^0]The fundamental novelty of Jamba is its hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture (though see mention below of recent related efforts).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nModels are 7B parameters, trained for 50B tokens. Figure 7 shows the training loss of the three architectures. While the pure Transformer and Mamba models have a similar convergence, the hybrid Jamba (no MoE) has a lower loss throughout this run. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d108652aef3cf6e8c2bag-10.jpg?height=516&width=1050&top_left_y=1840&top_left_x=532)\n\nFigure 7: Training loss curves for pure Attention, pure Mamba, and an Attention-Mamba hybrid (no MoE ). All models are 7B parameters. The hybrid achieves better loss throughout this training run. ### 6.2 Why does the Combination Work? The pure Mamba model showed fairly good results in most tasks early on, including in general perplexity evaluations. However, it performed substantially worse than the pure Attention model in three common benchmark tasks: IMDB [32], QuAC [6], and NarrativeQA [26]. In contrast, the hybrid Attention-Mamba performed similarly to the Attention model on these datasets. Table 6 shows the results for 1.3 B models after 250B tokens. |  | IMDB | QuAC | NarrativeQA |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Attention | 84.1 | 27.9 | 45.8 |\n| Mamba | 48.8 | 20.2 | 27.7 |\n| Attention-Mamba | 90.9 | 26.6 | 43.7 |\n\nTable 6: Mamba performs poorly on certain datasets, while the Attention-Mamba hybrid performs on par with the Attention model. Looking into these results further, we found out that the pure Mamba model often does not follow the correct format. For instance, in the IMDB dataset, answer choices are \"Positive\" or \"Negative\". While the Attention model adheres to this format, the pure Mamba model often produces other answers, such as \"Very Good\", \"Very Positive\", \"Funny\", \"Bad\", \"Poor\", and \" $3 / 10$ \". While these may be considered correct answers, the difficulty of Mamba to adhere to the format suggests a potential problem. Indeed, to perform successful in-context learning, it is important for models to capture the input-output format [34]. The hybrid Attention-Mamba model follows the format successfully, just like the pure Attention model. We hypothesize that this phenomenon points to a limitation of SSMs - a potential difficulty in in-context learning (ICL). Indeed, the ability to perform ICL has been linked to the emergence of socalled induction heads in Transformer language models during training, which perform approximate copying operations that are supportive of ICL [35]. We conjecture that the lack of an attention mechanism in the pure Mamba model makes it difficult for it to learn in-context. While Mamba may learn to copy and perform simple ICL when explicitly trained to do so ([17, 36], it is not clear if ICL is an emergent capability in SSM as is typical of Transformer models. In contrast, the hybrid Attention-Mamba model does perform successful ICL, even when only 1 out of 8 layers is an Attention one. As anecdotal evidence of an emergent induction mechanism, we visualize in Figure 8 the attention of an example head from a 1.3B Attention-Mamba hybrid model (no MoE), on an IMDB example where the pure Mamba failed and the hybrid succeeded. Clearly, the attention from the last token (\":\") is focused on the labels from the few-shot examples. We have found 12 such heads in our hybrid model, in all three attention layers (which correspond to layers 4, 12, 20 in the model). Future work can further investigate the emergence of ICL in hybrid models at large scale. Our released checkpoints would hopefully facilitate such investigations. Finally, very recent work has attempted to extract attention-like scores from state-space models like Mamba [1], which opens another direction to search for induction capabilities in state-space models. ### 6.3 The Effect of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\n\nRecent work has shown that MoE improves Transformer language models while keeping compute manageable [24]. ${ }^{6}$ However, it is not clear if MoE integrates well with state-space models at a large scale, and specifically with our hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture. Indeed, Table 7 shows that MoE improves the performance of the hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture at large scale (7B parameters trained on 50B tokens). The MoE variant has $n=16$ total experts, $K=2$ experts used at each token, and MoE is applied every $e=2$ layers, as described in Section 3.1.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Mixture of Experts, Switch Transformer, Sparse MoE\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Shazeer, Azalia Mirhoseini, Krzysztof Maziarz, Andy Davis, Quoc V. Le, Geoffrey E. Hinton, J. Dean*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks, and applies the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.\n\n**Abstract:** The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 2042  (*Influential: 257*)\n\n#### 2.

Locatelli, Sara Hooker*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes extremely parameter-efficient MoE by uniquely combining MoE architecture with lightweight experts and is on par with full fine-tuning by only updating the lightweight experts -- less than 1% of an 11B parameters model.\n\n**Abstract:** The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a widely known neural architecture where an ensemble of specialized sub-models optimizes overall performance with a constant computational cost. However, conventional MoEs pose challenges at scale due to the need to store all experts in memory. In this paper, we push MoE to the limit. We propose extremely parameter-efficient MoE by uniquely combining MoE architecture with lightweight experts.Our MoE architecture outperforms standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and is on par with full fine-tuning by only updating the lightweight experts -- less than 1% of an 11B parameters model. Furthermore, our method generalizes to unseen tasks as it does not depend on any prior task knowledge. Our research underscores the versatility of the mixture of experts architecture, showcasing its ability to deliver robust performance even when subjected to rigorous parameter constraints.

For example, thanks to scaling, GPT-3 was able to achieve strong results on in-context learning tasks. However, training these large dense models requires significant amounts of computing resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a family of language models named GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts architecture to scale the model capacity while also incurring substantially less training cost compared to dense variants. The largest GLaM has 1.2 trillion parameters, which is approximately 7x larger than GPT-3. It consumes only 1/3 of the energy used to train GPT-3 and requires half of the computation flops for inference, while still achieving better overall zero-shot and one-shot performance across 29 NLP tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 600  (*Influential: 48*)\n\n#### 4. M3ViT: Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer for Efficient Multi-task Learning with Model-Accelerator Co-design\n\n*From Search Query: Switch Transformer*\n\n*Hanxue Liang, Zhiwen Fan, Rishov Sarkar, Ziyu Jiang, Tianlong Chen, Kai Zou, Yu Cheng, Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL that customizes mixture-of-experts layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training, and is enhanced by hardware-level innovations.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

However, existing multilingual models based on Transformer are limited in terms of both translation performance and inference speed. In this paper, we propose switch-GLAT, a non-autoregressive multilingual machine translation model with a code-switch decoder. It can generate contextual codeswitched translations for a given source sentence, and perform code-switch backtranslation, greatly boosting multilingual translation performance. In addition, its inference is highly efficient thanks to its parallel decoder. Experiments show that our proposed switch-GLAT outperform the multilingual Transformer with as much as 0.74 BLEU improvement and 6.2x faster decoding speed in inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse MoE*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts.

While generalist models achieve promising results on various benchmarks, they have performance degradation on some tasks compared with task-specialized models. In this work, we find that interference among different tasks and modalities is the main factor to this phenomenon. To mitigate such interference, we introduce the Conditional Mixture-of-Experts (Conditional MoEs) to generalist models. Routing strategies under different levels of conditions are proposed to take both the training/inference cost and generalization ability into account. By incorporating the proposed Conditional MoEs, the recently proposed generalist model Uni-Perceiver can effectively mitigate the interference across tasks and modalities, and achieves state-of-the-art results on a series of downstream tasks via prompt tuning on 1% of downstream data. Moreover, the introduction of Conditional MoEs still holds the generalization ability of generalist models to conduct zero-shot inference on new tasks, e.g., video-text retrieval and video caption. Code and pre-trained generalist models shall be released.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. On the Representation Collapse of Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts*\n\n*Zewen Chi, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Damai Dai, Shuming Ma, Barun Patra, Saksham Singhal, Payal Bajaj, Xia Song, Xian-Ling Mao, Heyan Huang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of experts provides larger model capacity while requiring a\nconstant computational overhead. It employs the routing mechanism to distribute\ninput tokens to the best-matched experts according to their hidden\nrepresentations. However, learning such a routing mechanism encourages token\nclustering around expert centroids, implying a trend toward representation\ncollapse. In this work, we propose to estimate the routing scores between\ntokens and experts on a low-dimensional hypersphere. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on cross-lingual language model pre-training and fine-tuning on\ndownstream tasks. Experimental results across seven multilingual benchmarks\nshow that our method achieves consistent gains. We also present a comprehensive\nanalysis on the representation and routing behaviors of our models.

MoEC: Mixture of Expert Clusters\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts*\n\n*Yuan Xie, Shaohan Huang, Tianyu Chen, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely Mixture of Experts (MoE) has received great interest due to its\npromising scaling capability with affordable computational overhead. MoE\nconverts dense layers into sparse experts, and utilizes a gated routing network\nto make experts conditionally activated. However, as the number of experts\ngrows, MoE with outrageous parameters suffers from overfitting and sparse data\nallocation. Such problems are especially severe on tasks with limited data,\nthus hindering the progress for MoE models to improve performance by scaling\nup. In this work, we propose Mixture of Expert Clusters - a general approach to\nenable expert layers to learn more diverse and appropriate knowledge by\nimposing variance-based constraints on the routing stage. We further propose a\ncluster-level expert dropout strategy specifically designed for the expert\ncluster structure. Our experiments reveal that MoEC could improve performance\non machine translation and natural language understanding tasks, and raise the\nperformance upper bound for scaling up experts under limited data. We also\nverify that MoEC plays a positive role in mitigating overfitting and sparse\ndata allocation.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Taming Sparsely Activated Transformer with Stochastic Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Switch Transformer*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Young Jin Kim, Hany Hassan, Ruofei Zhang, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can\neasily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without\nsignificant increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be\nparameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better\nperformance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by\nexploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such\nresearch might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used\nrouting methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly\nrouting inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model,\nTHOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models,\nsuch as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each\ninput during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a\nconsistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data\nbut also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make\nconsistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine\ntranslation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient\nin that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across\nvarious settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms\nthe Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as\nthat of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

We\nshow that this procedure either outperforms or is competitive with\nlearning-to-route mixture-of-expert methods such as Switch Transformers and\nBASE Layers, while requiring no routing parameters or extra terms in the\nobjective function such as a load balancing loss, and no sophisticated\nassignment algorithm. We study the performance of different hashing techniques,\nhash sizes and input features, and show that balanced and random hashes focused\non the most local features work best, compared to either learning clusters or\nusing longer-range context. We show our approach works well both on large\nlanguage modeling and dialogue tasks, and on downstream fine-tuning tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-08T14:54:24Z  (*Updated: 2021-07-20T13:46:33Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

SEER-MoE: Sparse Expert Efficiency through Regularization for\n  Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse MoE*\n\n*Alexandre Muzio, Alex Sun, Churan He*\n\n**Abstract:** The advancement of deep learning has led to the emergence of\nMixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models, known for their dynamic allocation of\ncomputational resources based on input. Despite their promise, MoEs face\nchallenges, particularly in terms of memory requirements.

The first\nstage involves pruning the total number of experts using a heavy-hitters\ncounting guidance, while the second stage employs a regularization-based\nfine-tuning strategy to recover accuracy loss and reduce the number of\nactivated experts during inference.

A Hybrid Tensor-Expert-Data Parallelism Approach to Optimize Mixture-of-Experts Training\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts*\n\n*Abhinav Bhatele, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Olatunji Ruwase, Siddharth Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that adds sparsely activated expert blocks to a base model, increasing the number of parameters without impacting computational costs. However, current distributed deep learning frameworks are limited in their ability to train high-quality MoE models with large base models. In this work, we present DeepSpeed-TED, a novel, three-dimensional, hybrid parallel algorithm that combines data, tensor, and expert parallelism to enable the training of MoE models with 4 to 8x larger base models than the current state-of-the-art. We also describe memory optimizations in the optimizer step, and communication optimizations that eliminate unnecessary data movement. We implement our approach in DeepSpeed and achieve speedups of 26% over a baseline (i.e. without our communication optimizations) when training a 40 billion parameter MoE model (6.7 billion base model with 16 experts) on 128 V100 GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: Switch Transformer*\n\n*Noam Shazeer, Barret Zoph, William Fedus*\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Switch Transformer*\n\n*Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen, Shean Wang, Yuanzhi Li, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Phillip Wallis, Yelong Shen, Edward J. Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Conference:** lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse MoE*\n\n*Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the speed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse Mixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 6. ST-MoE: Designing Stable and Transferable Sparse Expert Models\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse MoE*\n\n*William Fedus, Noam Shazeer, Jeff Dean, Yanping Huang, Nan Du, Sameer Kumar, Irwan Bello, Barret Zoph*\n\n**Abstract:** Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing -- but at a high cost. In response, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Switch Transformers have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models. But advancing the state-of-the-art across a broad set of natural language tasks has been hindered by training instabilities and uncertain quality during fine-tuning. Our work focuses on these issues and acts as a design guide. We conclude by scaling a sparse model to 269B parameters, with a computational cost comparable to a 32B dense encoder-decoder Transformer (Stable and Transferable Mixture-of-Experts or ST-MoE-32B). For the first time, a sparse model achieves state-of-the-art performance in transfer learning, across a diverse set of tasks including reasoning (SuperGLUE, ARC Easy, ARC Challenge), summarization (XSum, CNN-DM), closed book question answering (WebQA, Natural Questions), and adversarially constructed tasks (Winogrande, ANLI R3).\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism into the **SwiGluMLP** unit of an autoregressive language model, here are the key points and useful information from the provided sources:\n\n## Key Components of MoE Models\n\n- **Experts and Router**: MoE models consist of multiple experts, typically feed-forward networks (FFNs), and a router (or gate network) that determines which experts to activate for each input token. This selective activation allows for sparse computation, reducing the overall computational cost.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Sparse Activation**: By activating only a subset of experts for each input, MoE models can scale up the model capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost. This is particularly beneficial for large language models, as it enables handling vast amounts of data and complex tasks more efficiently.\n\n## Dynamic Routing Mechanism\n\n- **Token-Expert Affinity**: The router evaluates the input and selects experts based on token-expert affinity scores, ensuring that each token is processed by the most relevant experts. This dynamic routing enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns in language data.\n\n## Advantages and Challenges\n\n- **Advantages**: MoE models offer enhanced computational efficiency, improved performance on diverse tasks, and the ability to handle large-scale natural language processing tasks. They allow for significant scaling improvements without sacrificing inference speed.\n- **Challenges**: Key challenges include load balancing to avoid underutilization of some experts, training stability issues, and managing computational overhead, especially in distributed settings.\n\n## Relevant Architectures and Techniques\n\n- **Switch Transformers**: This architecture replaces traditional FFN layers with sparse MoE layers, using a top-1 routing mechanism where each token is routed to a single expert. This simplifies training and improves stability.\n- **GShard**: This implementation uses MoE to scale transformer models across multiple devices, facilitating efficient computation and training by splitting the model into smaller parts (shards) and activating only a subset of experts for each input.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n- **Expert Parallelism**: This technique involves splitting experts across GPU devices, which can be managed using frameworks like Amazon SageMaker's SMP v2. This approach helps in efficient training and inference by leveraging distributed computing resources.\n- **Training and Load Balancing**: Ensuring that each expert is effectively utilized without overwhelming the system is crucial. Techniques such as BASE Layers can simplify the training of large sparse models by decoupling expert selection from individual expert training.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Advanced MoE Techniques**: Investigate recent advancements like Tensor Routing and improved load balancing methods to address common challenges in MoE models.\n- **Integration with TTT Layers**: Research how MoE architectures interact with Test-Time Training mechanisms to ensure compatibility and stability.\n- **Efficiency Optimization**: Look into methods for reducing communication overhead and improving hardware utilization, such as expert capacity scaling and expert parallelism.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Shazeer et al.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nJ. (2020).

However, MoWE is language-specific and uses a fixed routing scheme. Theoretical and empirical evidence (Clark et al. 2022 Dikkala et al. 2023) highlights the advantages of learned routers over non-trainable ones. Thus, an MoE design with a learned router scalable to over a million experts remains an open area for exploration. This work introduces the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) architecture, leveraging product key retrieval (Lample et al. 2019) for efficient routing to an extremely large number of experts, decoupling computational cost from parameter count. This design demonstrates a superior compute-performance tradeoff in our experiments, positioning it as a competitive alternative to dense FFW layers for scaling foundation models. The main contributions of this work are:\n\n- Exploration of Extreme MoE Setting: Deviating from the focus on a small number of large experts in previous MoE research, this work investigates the under-explored case of numerous tiny experts. - Learned Index Structure for Routing: Demonstrating for the first time that a learned index structure (Kraska et al. 2018) can efficiently route to over a million experts. - New Layer Design: Combining product key routing with single-neuron experts, we introduce the PEER layer that expands layer capacity without significant computational overheads. Empirical results demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs and Product Key Memory (PKM) layers. - Comprehensive Ablation Studies: We investigate the impact of different design choices of PEER such as number of experts, active parameters, number of heads and query batch normalization on language modeling tasks. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-03.jpg?height=562&width=1381&top_left_y=277&top_left_x=337)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the PEER layer. A PEER layer can be inserted in the middle of a transformer backbone or can be used to replace FFW layers. Given the state vector $x$ from the previous layer, a query network $q$ maps it to a query vector $q(x)$, which is then compared with the product keys to compute the router scores and to retrieve the top $k$ experts $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{k}$. After the retrieved experts make their predictions $e_{i}(x)$, their outputs are linearly combined using the softmax-normalized router scores as weights. ## 2 Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) layer, which is a Mixture of Experts architecture using product keys (Lample et al., 2019) in the router and single-neuron MLPs as experts.

Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts.

Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. PanGu-\u03c0: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation (Avg.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Multimodal Contrastive Learning with LIMoE: the Language-Image Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts training stability*\n\n*Basil Mustafa, C. Riquelme, J. Puigcerver, Rodolphe Jenatton, N. Houlsby*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents the Language-Image MoE, LIMoE, a sparse mixture of experts model capable of multimodal learning, and proposes an entropy-based regularization scheme for its training stability and balanced expert utilization.\n\n**Abstract:** Large sparsely-activated models have obtained excellent performance in multiple domains. However, such models are typically trained on a single modality at a time. We present the Language-Image MoE, LIMoE, a sparse mixture of experts model capable of multimodal learning. LIMoE accepts both images and text simultaneously, while being trained using a contrastive loss. MoEs are a natural fit for a multimodal backbone, since expert layers can learn an appropriate partitioning of modalities. However, new challenges arise; in particular, training stability and balanced expert utilization, for which we propose an entropy-based regularization scheme. Across multiple scales, we demonstrate remarkable performance improvement over dense models of equivalent computational cost. LIMoE-L/16 trained comparably to CLIP-L/14 achieves 78.6% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy (vs. 76.2%), and when further scaled to H/14 (with additional data) it achieves 84.1%, comparable to state-of-the-art methods which use larger custom per-modality backbones and pre-training schemes. We analyse the quantitative and qualitative behavior of LIMoE, and demonstrate phenomena such as differing treatment of the modalities and the organic emergence of modality-specific experts.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 139  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Scaling physics-informed hard constraints with mixture-of-experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts training stability*\n\n*N. Chalapathi, Yiheng Du, Aditi Krishnapriyan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture and achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems.\n\n**Abstract:** Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an\"expert\"through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. MoE-RBench: Towards Building Reliable Language Models with Sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts training stability*\n\n*Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that the robustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings, and empirical observations suggest that with appropriate hyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, the MoE model can be built more reliably than the dense LLM.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity as a promising framework for scaling up large language models (LLMs). However, the reliability assessment of MoE lags behind its surging applications. Moreover, when transferred to new domains such as in fine-tuning MoE models sometimes underperform their dense counterparts. Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we propose $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$, the first comprehensive assessment of SMoE reliability from three aspects: $\\textit{(i)}$ safety and hallucination, $\\textit{(ii)}$ resilience to adversarial attacks, and $\\textit{(iii)}$ out-of-distribution robustness. Extensive models and datasets are tested to compare the MoE to dense networks from these reliability dimensions. Our empirical observations suggest that with appropriate hyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, we can build the MoE model more reliably than the dense LLM. In particular, we find that the robustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the pre-trained MoE model to other tasks with higher-generation security, quality, and stability.

Learning Distributed and Fair Policies for Network Load Balancing as Markov Potential Game\n\n*From Search Query: MoE load balancing*\n\n*Zhiyuan Yao, Zihan Ding*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the network load balancing problem in data centers (DCs) where multiple load balancers (LBs) are deployed, using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, and forms a fully distributed MARL algorithm to approximate the Nash equilibrium of the game.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates the network load balancing problem in data centers (DCs) where multiple load balancers (LBs) are deployed, using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The challenges of this problem consist of the heterogeneous processing architecture and dynamic environments, as well as limited and partial observability of each LB agent in distributed networking systems, which can largely degrade the performance of in-production load balancing algorithms in real-world setups. Centralised-training-decentralised-execution (CTDE) RL scheme has been proposed to improve MARL performance, yet it incurs -- especially in distributed networking systems, which prefer distributed and plug-and-play design scheme -- additional communication and management overhead among agents. We formulate the multi-agent load balancing problem as a Markov potential game, with a carefully and properly designed workload distribution fairness as the potential function. A fully distributed MARL algorithm is proposed to approximate the Nash equilibrium of the game. Experimental evaluations involve both an event-driven simulator and real-world system, where the proposed MARL load balancing algorithm shows close-to-optimal performance in simulations, and superior results over in-production LBs in the real-world system.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Online Unrelated Machine Load Balancing with Predictions Revisited\n\n*From Search Query: MoE load balancing*\n\n*Shi Li, Jiayi Xian*\n\n**TL;DR:** Deterministic and randomized online rounding algorithms for the online load balancing problem with machine learned predictions, and re-sults that improve upon and extend those in a recent paper by Lattanzi et al. (2020).\n\n**Abstract:** We study the online load balancing problem with machine learned predictions, and give re-sults that improve upon and extend those in a recent paper by Lattanzi et al. (2020). First, we design deterministic and randomized online rounding algorithms for the problem in the unrelated machine setting, with O (cid:16) log m loglog m (cid:17) - and O (cid:16) loglog m logloglog m (cid:17) -competitive ratios. They respectively improve upon the previous ratios of O (log m ) and O (log 3 log m ) , and match the lower bounds given by Lattanzi et al. Second, we extend their prediction scheme from the identical machine restricted assignment setting to the unrelated machine setting. With the knowledge of two vectors over machines, a dual vector and a weight vector, we can construct a good fractional assignment online, that can be passed to an online rounding algorithm. Finally, we consider the learning model introduced by Lavastida et al. (2020), and show that under the model, the two vectors can be learned ef\ufb01ciently with a few samples of instances.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Online Learning for Load Balancing of Unknown Monotone Resource Allocation Games\n\n*From Search Query: MoE load balancing*\n\n*Ilai Bistritz, N. Bambos*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple algorithm is proposed that learns to shift the NE of the game to meet the total load constraints by adjusting the pricing coef\ufb01cients in an online manner and it is proved that the algorithm guarantees convergence in L2 to a NE that meets target total load constraints.\n\n**Abstract:** Consider N players that each uses a mixture of K resources. Each of the players\u2019 reward functions includes a linear pricing term for each resource that is controlled by the game manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone, so if each player runs gradient descent, the dynamics converge to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). Unfortunately, this NE can be inef\ufb01cient since the total load on a given resource can be very high. In principle, we can control the total loads by tuning the coef\ufb01cients of the pricing terms. However, \ufb01nding pricing coef\ufb01cients that balance the loads requires knowing the players\u2019 reward functions and their action sets. Obtaining this game structure information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates the users\u2019 privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE of the game to meet the total load constraints by adjusting the pricing coef\ufb01cients in an online manner. Our al-gorithm only requires the total load per resource as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm guarantees convergence in L2 to a NE that meets target total load constraints. Simulations show the effectiveness of our approach when applied to smart grid demand-side management or power control in wireless networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Memory Augmented Language Models through Mixture of Word Experts\n\n*From Search Query: MoE routing mechanisms*\n\n*Cicero Nogueira dos Santos, James Lee-Thorp, Isaac Noble, Chung-Ching Chang, David Uthus*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work seeks to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary based routing functions and demonstrates that MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling up the number of parameters of language models has proven to be an effective approach to improve performance. For dense models, increasing their size proportionally increases their computational footprint. In this work, we seek to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary based routing functions. Our proposed approach, dubbed Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE), can be seen as a memory augmented model, where a large set of word-specific experts play the role of a sparse memory. We demonstrate that MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks. Moreover, MoWE outperforms traditional MoE models on knowledge intensive tasks and has similar performance to complex memory augmented approaches that often require to invoke custom mechanisms to search the sparse memory.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Taming Sparsely Activated Transformer with Stochastic Experts\n\n*From Search Query: MoE routing mechanisms*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Young Jin Kim, Hany Hassan, Ruofei Zhang, T. Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts), which is trained using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make consistent predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can easily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without significant increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be parameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better performance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by exploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such research might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used routing methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly routing inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models, such as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each input during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make consistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine translation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient in that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across various settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms the Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as that of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts training stability*\n\n*Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the speed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse Mixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Experts training stability*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

MoESys: A Distributed and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Training and Inference System for Internet Services\n\n*From Search Query: MoE load balancing*\n\n*LiRong Dai, Weibao Gong, Hongxiang Hao, Liang Shen, dianhai yu, Haoyi Xiong, Jiang Bian, HuaChao Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** While modern internet services, such as chatbots, search engines, and online advertising, demand the use of large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), distributed training and inference over heterogeneous computing systems are desired to facilitate these DNN models. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is one the most common strategies to lower the cost of training subject to the overall size of models/data through gating and parallelism in a divide-and-conquer fashion. While DeepSpeed has made efforts in carrying out large-scale MoE training over heterogeneous infrastructures, the efficiency of training and inference could be further improved from several system aspects, including load balancing, communication/computation efficiency, and memory footprint limits. In this work, we present a novel MoESys that boosts efficiency in both large-scale training and inference. Specifically, in the training procedure, the proposed MoESys adopts an Elastic MoE training strategy with 2D prefetch and Fusion communication over Hierarchical storage, so as to enjoy efficient parallelisms. For scalable inference in a single node, especially when the model size is larger than GPU memory, MoESys builds the CPU-GPU memory jointly into a ring of sections to load the model, and executes the computation tasks across the memory sections in a round-robin manner for efficient inference. We carried out extensive experiments to evaluate MoESys, where MoESys successfully trains a Unified Feature Optimization (UFO) model with a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts model of 12B parameters in 8 days on 48 A100 GPU cards. The comparison against the state-of-the-art shows that MoESys outperformed DeepSpeed with 33% higher throughput (tokens per second) in training and 13% higher throughput in inference in general. Particularly, under unbalanced MoE Tasks, e.g., UFO, MoESys achieved 64% higher throughput with 18% lower memory footprints.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Scaling Diffusion Transformers to 16 Billion Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: MoE load balancing*\n\n*Junshi Huang, Debang Li, Changqian Yu, Mingyuan Fan, Zhengcong Fei*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present DiT-MoE, a sparse version of the diffusion Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with dense networks while exhibiting highly optimized inference. The DiT-MoE includes two simple designs: shared expert routing and expert-level balance loss, thereby capturing common knowledge and reducing redundancy among the different routed experts. When applied to conditional image generation, a deep analysis of experts specialization gains some interesting observations: (i) Expert selection shows preference with spatial position and denoising time step, while insensitive with different class-conditional information; (ii) As the MoE layers go deeper, the selection of experts gradually shifts from specific spacial position to dispersion and balance. (iii) Expert specialization tends to be more concentrated at the early time step and then gradually uniform after half. We attribute it to the diffusion process that first models the low-frequency spatial information and then high-frequency complex information. Based on the above guidance, a series of DiT-MoE experimentally achieves performance on par with dense networks yet requires much less computational load during inference. More encouragingly, we demonstrate the potential of DiT-MoE with synthesized image data, scaling diffusion model at a 16.5B parameter that attains a new SoTA FID-50K score of 1.80 in 512$\\times$512 resolution settings.

OpenMoE: An Early Effort on Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: MoE routing mechanisms*\n\n*Yang You, Wangchunshu Zhou, Zangwei Zheng, Jinjie Ni, Yao Fu, Zian Zheng, Fuzhao Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** To help the open-source community have a better understanding of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development. One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: MoE routing mechanisms*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism into the **SwiGluMLP** unit, focusing on training stability, load balancing, and routing mechanisms, here are the most relevant and useful insights from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Training Stability\n\n- **Momentum Integration**: The concept of integrating momentum into Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) as described in can significantly improve training stability. MomentumSMoE theoretically and numerically demonstrates better stability and robustness compared to traditional SMoE, which can be crucial for integrating MoE into **SwiGluMLP**.\n\n- **Residual Routing**: As mentioned in the analysis note, residual routing can enhance gradient flow and stabilize training. This technique aligns with the need for stable training in MoE architectures.\n\n## Load Balancing\n\n- **Auxiliary Loss**: Implementing an auxiliary loss, also known as load balancing loss, helps ensure that experts have equal importance during training. This is achieved by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) of the importance scores and updating the loss to minimize CV, ensuring a more even distribution of experts.\n\n- **Expert Capacity**: Limiting the amount of tokens an expert can handle (expert capacity) prevents overloading specific experts and ensures that tokens are distributed evenly among them. This mechanism can be integrated to manage the load effectively.\n\n## Routing Mechanisms\n\n- **Hash Layers**: Using hash-based routing instead of a learned gating network can eliminate load imbalance and simplify training. This approach ensures uniform expert utilization and reduces complexity.\n\n- **Simplified Gating**: Employing a simple gating network, such as top-1 or top-2 routing, can enhance training efficiency and reduce complexity. This is particularly relevant when integrating MoE with existing architectures like **SwiGluMLP**.\n\n- **Router Design**: The router's design is critical. Observations from suggest that the router usually selects experts with larger output norms, and expert diversity increases as the layer increases. This insight can guide the design of the gating mechanism to ensure effective routing.\n\n## Integration with SwiGluMLP and TTT Layers\n\n- **Compatibility with Existing Layers**: Ensuring the MoE mechanism is compatible with **TTT** layers involves preserving or enhancing test-time adaptability. This might involve adapting the MoE routing mechanisms to align with the adaptive training techniques of **TTT** layers.\n\n- **Gating Mechanism Synergy**: Leveraging GLU variants, as suggested in the analysis note, can simplify the integration of MoE within **SwiGluMLP**. The careful design of the gating mechanism, possibly incorporating ideas from GLU variants, can improve the effectiveness of the routing.\n\n## Efficiency and Hardware Considerations\n\n- **Sparse Activation**: MoE models activate only a subset of experts for each input, significantly reducing computation during training and inference. This sparsity is crucial for maintaining efficiency, especially when scaling large language models.\n\n- **Managing Expert Capacity**: Adjusting the capacity of experts and managing the number of experts and their sizes are important for optimizing memory usage and computational resources. This ensures that the model remains efficient on hardware.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Stability and Load Balancing**: Integrate momentum into SMoE and use auxiliary loss to ensure load balancing.\n- **Routing Mechanisms**: Use hash-based routing or simplified gating mechanisms to ensure uniform expert utilization.\n- **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with **TTT** layers by preserving test-time adaptability and leverage GLU variants for gating mechanism design.\n- **Efficiency**: Optimize expert capacity and manage the number of experts to maintain computational efficiency.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient MoE integration within the **SwiGluMLP** unit, addressing the key challenges of training stability, load balancing, and routing mechanisms.\n",

Mixture of A Million Experts (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Xu Owen He*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million), is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** The feedforward (FFW) layers in standard transformer architectures incur a linear increase in computational costs and activation memory as the hidden layer width grows. Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n2023). However, MoWE is language-specific and uses a fixed routing scheme. Theoretical and empirical evidence (Clark et al. 2022 Dikkala et al. 2023) highlights the advantages of learned routers over non-trainable ones. Thus, an MoE design with a learned router scalable to over a million experts remains an open area for exploration. This work introduces the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) architecture, leveraging product key retrieval (Lample et al. 2019) for efficient routing to an extremely large number of experts, decoupling computational cost from parameter count. This design demonstrates a superior compute-performance tradeoff in our experiments, positioning it as a competitive alternative to dense FFW layers for scaling foundation models. The main contributions of this work are:\n\n- Exploration of Extreme MoE Setting: Deviating from the focus on a small number of large experts in previous MoE research, this work investigates the under-explored case of numerous tiny experts. - Learned Index Structure for Routing: Demonstrating for the first time that a learned index structure (Kraska et al. 2018) can efficiently route to over a million experts. - New Layer Design: Combining product key routing with single-neuron experts, we introduce the PEER layer that expands layer capacity without significant computational overheads. Empirical results demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs and Product Key Memory (PKM) layers. - Comprehensive Ablation Studies: We investigate the impact of different design choices of PEER such as number of experts, active parameters, number of heads and query batch normalization on language modeling tasks. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-03.jpg?height=562&width=1381&top_left_y=277&top_left_x=337)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the PEER layer. A PEER layer can be inserted in the middle of a transformer backbone or can be used to replace FFW layers. Given the state vector $x$ from the previous layer, a query network $q$ maps it to a query vector $q(x)$, which is then compared with the product keys to compute the router scores and to retrieve the top $k$ experts $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{k}$. After the retrieved experts make their predictions $e_{i}(x)$, their outputs are linearly combined using the softmax-normalized router scores as weights. ## 2 Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) layer, which is a Mixture of Experts architecture using product keys (Lample et al., 2019) in the router and single-neuron MLPs as experts. Fig. 2 illustrates the computational process within a PEER layer. PEER Overview Formally, a PEER layer is a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that consists of three parts: a pool of $N$ experts $\\mathbb{E}:=\\left\\{e_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where each expert $e_{i}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ shares the same signature as $f$, a corresponding set of $N$ product keys $\\mathbb{K}:=\\left\\{k_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and a query network $q: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that maps the input vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a query vector $q(x)$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/21 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1525-1534, Berlin, Germany, August 2016.

Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Kersting, Taiji Suzuki, Brian Hie, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R'e, Ce Zhang, Stefano Massaroli*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/40 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_46d2059d3f5ccf0ee670g-27.jpg?height=537&width=1578&top_left_y=1770&top_left_x=238)\n\nFigure B.9: Replication of Fig. B. 8 for the Mamba and Striped Mamba architectures and IsoFLOP groups 8 e 18 and 2 e 19 . ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_46d2059d3f5ccf0ee670g-28.jpg?height=492&width=690&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=683)\n\nFigure C.1: Increasing batch size with compute FLOPS can shift the compute-efficient frontier. When increasing batch size after $10^{9}$ parameters (red), the IsoFLOP curve underestimates the performance of larger models, when compared to a fixed batch size (blue), shifting the optimum estimation towards smaller models. ## C Scaling Laws\n\nWe design our model topologies starting from previous compute-optimal scaling results for Transformers [23], and selecting the number of layers (depth) and width to cover a range of parameters from $8 e 6$ to $7 e 9$ parameters (see Table C.2). The depth and width are generally fixed across models, which result in minor parameter count differences (except for the mixture of experts models where a distinction between total and active parameters must be made, see Tables C.4 and C.3). To compare how each model scales, we control for several compute budgets (IsoFLOP groups): $4 \\mathrm{e} 18,8 \\mathrm{e} 18,2 \\mathrm{e} 19,4 \\mathrm{e} 19,8 \\mathrm{e} 19,2 \\mathrm{e} 20,5 \\mathrm{e} 20,2 \\mathrm{e} 21$. We linearly interpolate learning rates from common settings at $150 e 6,350 e 6,1.3 e 9,3 e 9$ and $7 e 9$ model sizes, obtaining a linearly inverse relationship with model size. Batch size is scaled (increased) in discrete steps, with larger training FLOPs using larger batch sizes. For state-optimal scaling results, we obtain the optimal model size from the compute-optimal frontier, then compute the dynamic and fixed state dimensions of the closest model size available in the set of results. ## C. 1 Training Details\n\nWe control for key hyperparameters across all models, including batch size (Table C.1), learning rate (Table C.2) and scheduler. Most models were trained on a single node. For larger IsoFLOP groups, we trained in a multinode distributed training with tensor parallelism. We used a cosine decay learning rate scheduler, with warm up using $1 \\%$ the number of training steps, and the minimum decay to reach $10 \\%$ of the max learning rate. Table C.1: Batch sizes by IsoFLOP group. For very small models ( $<54 \\mathrm{M}$ ) parameters, batch size 262 k is used. | IsOFLOP | BATCH SizE |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| $4.0 \\mathrm{E}+18$ | 524 K |\n| $8.0 \\mathrm{E}+18$ | 524 K |\n| $2.0 \\mathrm{E}+19$ | 524 K |\n| $4.0 \\mathrm{E}+19$ | 524 K |\n| $8.0 \\mathrm{E}+19$ | 524 K |\n| $2.0 \\mathrm{E}+20$ | 1 M |\n| $5.0 \\mathrm{E}+20$ | 1 M |\n| $2.0 \\mathrm{E}+21$ | 2 M |\n\n## C. 2 Model architectures\n\nWe describe shared architecture details first, followed by model specific designs below. All models use a modern SwiGLU unit as the channel mixer, except for Mamba and StripedMamba (which merges the GLU block with the sequence mixer layer, resulting in twice the number of sequence mixers). We use RMSNorm [42] for normalization. All models tie the embedding layers. All sparsely activated layers use learned argmax routing. Transformer++ Transformer++ is state-of-the-art Transformer model, with rotary positional embeddings [43], SwiGLU and RMSNorm. Hyena We use the original architecture [10] with some improvements. The channel mixer is replaced with SwiGLU, we use RMSNorm, set weight decay to 0 to all Hyena layer parameters. Multi-Head Hyena We use a Hyena layer with heads as described by [24]. We sweep across different head dimensions at the IsoFLOP group 2 e 19 to find an optimal head dimension (8), and use the same number for all other experiments. StripedHyena We use 3 striping schedule ratios: $1 \\mathrm{~A}: 1 \\mathrm{H}, 1 \\mathrm{~A}: 3 \\mathrm{H}, 1 \\mathrm{~A}: 11 \\mathrm{H}$, where $\\mathrm{A}=$ Attention and $\\mathrm{H}=$ Hyena along model depth. In instances where the number of layers is not a multiple of the schedule, the ratio is repeated until the target depth is reached. Mamba Mamba doubles the number of sequence mixers, replacing the dedicated channel mixer, and uses a custom input-varying recurrence. Hyperparameters (state dimension 16, expansion factor 2, conv projection length 4 and width of implicit network are sourced from the original implementation [12])\n\nStripedMamba Similar to StripedHyena, we use the 3 striping ratio schedules to interleave attention at specified intervals along model depth. StripedHyena-MoE The StripedHyena-MoE replaces SwiGLU with a total of 8 experts and 2 active experts. We keep the same depth and model width in the mixer layer as baseline models, and adjust the MoE widths to match active parameters. StripedHyena Experts-MoE This model introduces expert in the Hyena sequence mixer at the output level, as described in the main text. We use a StripedHyena with striping ratio 1:11, and the following expert counts: total experts $=8$, active experts $=2$, total mixer experts $=8$, active mixer experts $=2$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to integrate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism into the **SwiGluMLP** unit to enhance the model's capacity, efficiency, and compatibility with existing components like Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Training Stability Enhancements\n- **Residual Routing**: Introducing residual connections within the gating mechanism can improve gradient flow and stabilize training. This is supported by Zoph et al. (2022) and aligns with the need for stable training in MoE models.\n- **Entropy-Based Regularization**: Applying entropy-based regularization encourages balanced expert utilization, preventing certain experts from dominating and ensuring more stable training. This is highlighted in Mustafa et al. (2022).\n- **Momentum Integration**: Incorporating momentum into the training of MoE models enhances stability and robustness, crucial for integrating MoE into **SwiGluMLP**. This is mentioned in the \"Momentum Integration for Training Stability in Sparse Mixture of Experts\" web search result.\n\n## Load Balancing Strategies\n- **Auxiliary Loss Functions**: Implementing a load balancing loss minimizes the variance in expert utilization, ensuring that all experts are engaged during training. This involves penalizing the routing function for producing imbalanced weights and using metrics like the coefficient of variation (CV) to ensure equal importance among experts.\n- **Expert Capacity Management**: Limiting the number of tokens each expert processes (expert capacity) prevents overloading and ensures even distribution of workload. This can include setting a max capacity for each expert and using residual connections to handle dropped inputs.\n\n## Routing Mechanisms\n- **Hash-Based Routing**: Replacing learned gating networks with hash-based routing simplifies training and eliminates load imbalance, ensuring uniform expert utilization. This is proposed by Roller et al. (2021).\n- **Simplified Gating Networks**: Employing simple gating mechanisms like top-1 or top-2 routing reduces complexity and enhances training efficiency. This is discussed in Fedus et al. (2022).\n- **Dynamic Routing**: Ensuring the dynamic routing in MoE aligns with the existing **SwiGluMLP** structure and TTT mechanisms is crucial. This might involve using GLU variants that integrate well with the current architecture.\n\n## Efficiency and Hardware Considerations\n- **Sparse Activation**: By activating only relevant experts per input, computational efficiency is maintained, allowing the model to scale without prohibitive computational costs. MoE models are highly scalable and efficient, especially for batched inference and large-scale tasks.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Managing the number of experts and their sizes optimizes memory usage and leverages hardware capabilities effectively. This includes strategies like expert parallelism and data parallelism to distribute the workload efficiently.\n\n## Integration with SwiGluMLP and TTT Layers\n- **Compatibility with TTT Layers**: Ensuring the MoE integration maintains or enhances test-time adaptability is essential. This might involve aligning the dynamic routing with TTT mechanisms to ensure seamless integration.\n- **Localized Modification**: The integration should remain within the **SwiGluMLP** unit to comply with the instruction of making localized changes without affecting other GAUs.\n\n## Empirical Validation\n- Planning experiments to compare the modified **SwiGluMLP** with the original version in terms of performance metrics, training stability, and resource utilization is crucial.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/51 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\n(2021), Sun et al. (2024), and Beck et al. (2024). This paper adopts a middle ground between the scalar and the fully low-rank parameterization by using $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}$. ${ }^{5}$ This results in the following recurrent form,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}=\\operatorname{Diag}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}$ is parameterized via a low-rank linear layer followed by sigmoid on $x_{t}$ (see \u00a74.4). Note that the above formulation is general and encompasses several recent RNNs (Katsch, 2023; Qin et al., 2024b; Peng et al., 2024). Thus, the hardware-efficient GLA implementation (described next) could be directly used or adapted to other models. [^3]Parallel form. We now describe a parallel form GLA for parallelizing across sequence length. Unrolling Eq. 3 gives\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\left(\\left(\\prod_{j=i+1}^{t} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\odot \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nLetting $\\boldsymbol{b}_{t}:=\\prod_{j=1}^{t} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j}$, we can rewrite the above as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{o}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\mathbf{S}_{t} & =\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{b}_{t}}{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i}}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\odot \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{i} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\odot \\boldsymbol{b}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i}}{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i}}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the division is element-wise. Letting $\\mathbf{B} \\in(0,1)^{L \\times d}$ be the matrix obtained from stacking $\\boldsymbol{b}_{t}$ 's, the parallel form is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=((\\underbrace{(\\mathbf{Q} \\odot \\mathbf{B})\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{K}}{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)^{\\top}}_{\\mathbf{P}}) \\odot \\mathbf{M}) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nHowever, this form is not numerical stable as $\\boldsymbol{b}_{t}$ is the cumulative product of gate values in $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j} \\in(0,1)^{1 \\times d}$, and thus can be extremely small when $t$ is large, making $\\frac{\\mathbf{K}}{\\mathbf{B}}$ explode. To handle this, we can compute in $\\log$ space for $\\mathbf{P},{ }^{6}$\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}_{i j}=\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\mathbf{Q}_{i k} \\mathbf{K}_{j k} \\exp \\left(\\log \\mathbf{B}_{i k}-\\log \\mathbf{B}_{j k}\\right), \\quad i \\geq j\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ denotes feature indices. However, unlike vanilla linear attention, as Eq. 4 cannot be represented via a standard matmul, and it cannot make use of half-precision matmuls on tensor cores. We will show in $\\S 4.3$ how a secondary-level chunking mechanism can enable the use of half-precision matmuls for most computations while maintaining numerical stability, as illustrated in Figure 3. ### 4.2 Chunkwise Parallel Form of GLA\n\nWe derive a chunkwise form of GLA similar to the chunkwise form of basic linear attention (\u00a72.2). Here the intra-chunk operation implements the above parallel form\n\n[^4]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-06.jpg?height=340&width=782&top_left_y=193&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 3: Attention-style map to illustrate the chunkwise computations in GLA. The inter-chunk dependencies (in gray) are not directly computed in the chunkwise form (only computed in the parallel form). The intra-chunk dependencies are modeled via secondary chunking/tiling where the inter-sub-chunk part (in orange) is computed by half-precision matmuls while the intra-sub-chunk part (in pink) is computed in full precision in log space. at the chunk-level to obtain $\\mathbf{O}^{\\text {intra }}$. For inter-chunk, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_{i C+j} & =\\frac{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i C+j}}{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i C}}, \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{i C+j}=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{b}_{(i+1) C}}{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i C+j}}, \\gamma_{i+1}=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{b}_{(i+1) C}}{\\boldsymbol{b}_{i C}} \\\\\n\\mathbf{S}_{[i+1]} & =\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i+1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{[i]}+\\left(\\mathbf{K}_{[i+1]} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{[i+1]}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}_{[i+1]} \\\\\n\\mathbf{O}_{[i+1]}^{\\text {inter }} & =\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[i+1]} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_{[i+1]}\\right) \\mathbf{S}_{[i]}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_{[i+1]}$ encodes the cumulative decay from the start of a chunk which will be used to propagate the hidden states from the previous chunk $\\mathbf{S}_{[i]}$, while $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{[i+1]}$ encodes the decay to the end of a chunk which will be used to accumulate information to be added to the next hidden state $\\mathbf{S}_{[i+1]}$. ### 4.3 Hardware-Efficient GLA\n\nWith the chunkwise form in hand, we can adapt the FlashLinEAR AtTENTIon algorithm presented in \u00a73 to the gated case.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form. GLA has a 2D forget gate $\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\in(0,1)^{d_{k} \\times d_{v}}$ that varies over time:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere we now allow the hidden state to have varying dimensions. This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1. Central to the design of gated linear attention is the parameterization of $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ which requires a balance between parameter-efficiency, state size, and training efficiency.

Mao (2022) propose a more efficient outer-product-based low-rank parameterization $\\left(\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{t}\\right)$, which requires $d \\cdot d_{v}+d \\cdot d_{k}$ parameters. ${ }^{4}$\n\nIn Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ is obtained by combining a data-independent learnable matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ with a data-dependent vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}$, which allows the matrix to be full rank. However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Michael Poli, Armin W.

Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/27 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10819-10829, 2022.

What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling? (Avg.

However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/28 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Deep Graph Representation Learning and Optimization for Influence Maximization\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants optimization*\n\n*Chen Ling, Junji Jiang, Junxiang Wang, M. Thai, Lukas Xue, James Song, M. Qiu, Liang Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework DeepIM is designed to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Influence maximization (IM) is formulated as selecting a set of initial users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users. Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.

Unexpected Improvements to Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants optimization*\n\n*S. Ament, Sam Daulton, David Eriksson, M. Balandat, E. Bakshy*\n\n**TL;DR:** The empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions.\n\n**Abstract:** Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization and has found countless successful applications, but its performance is often exceeded by that of more recent methods. Notably, EI and its variants, including for the parallel and multi-objective settings, are challenging to optimize because their acquisition values vanish numerically in many regions. This difficulty generally increases as the number of observations, dimensionality of the search space, or the number of constraints grow, resulting in performance that is inconsistent across the literature and most often sub-optimal. Herein, we propose LogEI, a new family of acquisition functions whose members either have identical or approximately equal optima as their canonical counterparts, but are substantially easier to optimize numerically. We demonstrate that numerical pathologies manifest themselves in\"classic\"analytic EI, Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), as well as their constrained, noisy, and parallel variants, and propose corresponding reformulations that remedy these pathologies. Our empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions, highlighting the understated role of numerical optimization in the literature.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. A Theoretical Analysis of Optimistic Proximal Policy Optimization in Linear Markov Decision Processes\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants optimization*\n\n*Han Zhong, T.

Despite its success, the theoretical understanding of PPO remains deficient. Specifically, it is unclear whether PPO or its optimistic variants can effectively solve linear Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are arguably the simplest models in RL with function approximation. To bridge this gap, we propose an optimistic variant of PPO for episodic adversarial linear MDPs with full-information feedback, and establish a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/4}H^2K^{3/4})$ regret for it. Here $d$ is the ambient dimension of linear MDPs, $H$ is the length of each episode, and $K$ is the number of episodes. Compared with existing policy-based algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art regret bound in both stochastic linear MDPs and adversarial linear MDPs with full information. Additionally, our algorithm design features a novel multi-batched updating mechanism and the theoretical analysis utilizes a new covering number argument of value and policy classes, which might be of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: competition mechanisms gated networks*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: competition mechanisms gated networks*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 6. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: competition mechanisms gated networks*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Gaussian Gated Linear Networks\n\n*From Search Query: competition mechanisms gated networks*\n\n*Eren Sezener, Adam Marblestone, David Budden, Joel Veness, Tor Lattimore, Greg Wayne*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Gaussian Gated Linear Network (G-GLN), an extension to the recently proposed GLN family of deep neural networks. Instead of using backpropagation to learn features, GLNs have a distributed and local credit assignment mechanism based on optimizing a convex objective. This gives rise to many desirable properties including universality, data-efficient online learning, trivial interpretability and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We extend the GLN framework from classification to multiple regression and density modelling by generalizing geometric mixing to a product of Gaussian densities. The G-GLN achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on several univariate and multivariate regression benchmarks, and we demonstrate its applicability to practical tasks including online contextual bandits and density estimation via denoising.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Combinatorial Perspective on Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: competition mechanisms gated networks*\n\n*Joel Veness, Marcus Hutter, David Budden, Eren Sezener, Jianan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence is characterized not only by the capacity to learn complex skills, but the ability to rapidly adapt and acquire new skills within an ever-changing environment. In this work we study how the learning of modular solutions can allow for effective generalization to both unseen and potentially differently distributed data. Our main postulate is that the combination of task segmentation, modular learning and memory-based ensembling can give rise to generalization on an exponentially growing number of unseen tasks. We provide a concrete instantiation of this idea using a combination of: (1) the Forget-Me-Not Process, for task segmentation and memory based ensembling; and (2) Gated Linear Networks, which in contrast to contemporary deep learning techniques use a modular and local learning mechanism. We demonstrate that this system exhibits a number of desirable continual learning properties: robustness to catastrophic forgetting, no negative transfer and increasing levels of positive transfer as more tasks are seen. We show competitive performance against both offline and online methods on standard continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on SwiGLU activation function variants, competition mechanisms in gated networks, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## SwiGLU Activation Function Variants and Optimizations\n\n- The SwiGLU activation function is a combination of the Swish activation function and Gated Linear Units (GLU). It has been shown to offer improved performance and trainability compared to traditional activation functions like ReLU[4|.\n- The implementation of SwiGLU involves two linear projections of the input, which are then combined using the Swish function. This is illustrated in the Flash-Attention implementation, where the gated MLP computes two linear projections fused into a single operation[2|.\n- For optimization, recent work has focused on introducing activation sparsity in SwiGLU-based models. Techniques such as CATS (Competition-Aware Training Sparsity) sparsify the output of the gate weights, replacing SiLU with a sparsification function, which can improve memory efficiency and reduce computational cost.\n\n## Competition Mechanisms in Gated Neural Architectures\n\n- Competition mechanisms in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can enhance expert utilization. For example, the CompeteSMoE method routes inputs only to experts with the highest neural response, showing improved convergence rates under mild assumptions[Analysis Note: From \"CompeteSMoE\"].\n- Integrating competition mechanisms with gated architectures can be beneficial. In MoE models, competition can lead to better load balancing and more efficient use of experts, which is crucial for training stability and performance[Analysis Note: Key Insights].\n\n## Integration of Multiple Gating Mechanisms\n\n- The use of multiple gating mechanisms, such as in the SwiGLU activation function, can improve the performance of neural networks. SwiGLU combines the gating mechanism of GLU with the Swish activation function, allowing for more nuanced and efficient processing of inputs[4|.\n- In the context of MoE models, integrating multiple gating mechanisms can help in managing the activation of different experts. This can be seen in methods that use gradual activation during training to improve stability[Analysis Note: Key Insights].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Gated Networks\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations are crucial for the practical deployment of gated networks. Techniques such as quantization (e.g., GGUF, HQQ, AWQ) can reduce memory usage and computational requirements, making the models more suitable for edge devices[4|.\n- Efficient state compression and query batch normalization are also important for balanced expert usage and memory efficiency in MoE models. These methods ensure that the models can be deployed on a variety of hardware without significant performance degradation[Analysis Note: Key Insights].\n\n## Training Stability in Multi-Gated Architectures\n\n- Training stability in multi-gated architectures is a critical challenge. Techniques such as gradual activation during training and careful attention to initialization can help improve stability. Load balancing is also essential to ensure efficient resource utilization and prevent overfitting or underutilization of certain experts[Analysis Note: Key Insights].\n- The use of competition mechanisms and fine-grained MoE architectures can also contribute to training stability by ensuring that the workload is distributed evenly among the experts[Analysis Note: From \"Mixture of A Million Experts\"].\n\nBy incorporating these insights, researchers can design more efficient, scalable, and stable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of SwiGLU activation functions, competition mechanisms, and hardware-efficient implementations.\n",

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n3 4}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 . 3 3}$ | $\\mathbf{1 4 . 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 9 . 0 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 4 5}$ |\n\n### 3.3 Ablations\n\nVarying the Number of Total Experts The models in the isoFLOP plot depicted in Fig. 1 all have over a million $\\left(1024^{2}\\right)$ experts.

The results indicate that, within the range of values considered, higher $h k$ generally leads to improved performance. Notably, the optimal $h$ increases as $h k$ increases. However, the performance gradually saturates, and increasing the number of active experts also increases device memory consumption and may necessitate additional accelerator devices. Thus in practice, the appropriate $h k$ values should be selected based on the trade-off between performance, device number and computational resource requirements. Table 2: KL and expert usage for different memory sizes, with and without query BN. Similar to the findings in PKM, using query BN results in a more balanced usage of the experts. | Expert num $N$ | 16 k |  | 65 k |  | 262 k |  | 1 M |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| BatchNorm | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Perplexity | 23.47 | 23.47 | 22.61 | 22.55 | 21.54 | 21.47 | 20.73 | 20.64 |\n| Expert Usage (\\%) | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 99.8 | 100.0 |\n| Unevenness ( $\\downarrow$ ) | 0.45 | 0.30 | 0.63 | 0.44 | 0.97 | 0.66 | 1.52 | 1.06 |\n\nExpert Usage and Query Batch Normalization Given the presence of over a million experts in the PEER layer, it is natural to inquire how many of these experts are actually selected during inference and whether their usage is evenly distributed. To analyze this, we kept an accumulated router score, denoted as $z_{i}^{\\prime}=$ $\\sum_{x} g_{i}(x)$ for each expert $e_{i}$ across all tokens $x$ within the C 4 validation set. Here $g_{i}(x)$ is the router score used to aggregate the expert output when token $x$ is given as input, with $g_{i}(x)=0$ if expert $e_{i}$ is not selected. From these accumulated router scores, we can obtain an empirical probability distribution vector, denoted as $z=z^{\\prime} /\\left\\|z^{\\prime}\\right\\|_{1}$, representing the distribution of all experts over the C 4 validation set. Then we computed the following metrics proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to assess the usage and distribution of experts:\n\n- Expert Usage: the fraction of experts retrieved during inference: $\\#\\left\\{z_{i} \\neq 0\\right\\}$\n- Unevenness: KL divergence between $z$ and the uniform distribution: $\\log (N)+\\sum_{i} z_{i} \\log \\left(z_{i}\\right)$\nwhere $N$ is the number of total experts. By default, we also added a batch normalization (BN) layer on top of the query network, as proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to increase the expert usage during training. Here we study the effect of adding this BN layer on the above-mentioned metrics. Table 2 presents the expert usage and unevenness for varying numbers of experts, with and without BN. We can see that even for 1 M experts, the expert usage is close to $100 \\%$, and using BN can lead to more balanced utilization of the experts and lower perplexities. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEER model in utilizing a large number of experts. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-08.jpg?height=722&width=985&top_left_y=845&top_left_x=559)\n\nFigure 4: Query BatchNorm Ablation. IsoFLOP curves of a PEER model with 1 M experts on the C4 dataset, with and without query BatchNorm. We additionally compared isoFLOP curves with and without BN. Fig. 4 shows that the PEER model with BN generally achieves lower perplexities. While the difference is not significant, it is most pronounced around the isoFLOP-optimal region. ## 4 Related Works\n\nMixture of Expert Since Shazeer et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparsely-gated Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) in efficiently increasing model capacity on GPU clusters, MoEs have emerged as a popular technique for scaling large models efficiently. Subsequent research (Fedus et al. 2022 Lepikhin et al. 2020 , Du et al., 2022 has proposed variations to address challenges such as load balancing, communication overhead, and training instability. These methods usually replace feedforward (FFW) layers in certain Transformer blocks with sparsely-gated MoE layers, which consist of multiple FFW layers as experts. Typically each expert matches the size of the regular dense FFW layer. Gating scores are calculated for each expert and token, and only the top k experts are activated for each token. These methods are known as token-choice methods. More recently, Zhou et al. (2022) introduced the Expert Choice routing method, where experts choose the top k tokens instead of tokens selecting experts. However, both token-choice and expert-choice methods require the top-k operator on a gating score matrix of size $N \\times M$ ( $N$ : number of experts, $M$ : number of tokens), resulting in a routing cost of at least $O(N)$. This limits their practical application to a small number of experts (typically less than 128). Instead of using the top-k operator, some works also proposed using deterministic hash tables as routers (Roller et al. 2021, dos Santos et al. 2023). With $O(1)$ average lookup complexity, these methods offer potential scalability to a large number of experts. However, these routers are fixed and not learned. Clark et al. (2022) showed that deterministic routing does not scale as well as trainable routers. Furthermore, Dikkala et al. (2023) proved theoretically that learned routers offer non-trivial advantages over their fixed counterparts, such as removing spurious directions and identifying latent clusters in data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed PEER layer employs a learned router with sublinear $(O(\\sqrt{N}))$ complexity. Since PEER uses lightweight experts, our work is also related to recent studies on parameter-efficient MoEs Wang et al. 2022, Zadouri et al., 2024). These methods utilize parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) adapters as experts instead of full-sized FFWs. Their focus is on minimizing the number of parameters updated during fine-tuning, allowing storage of only one copy of the large backbone model. In PEER, parameter efficiency refers to the small number of active parameters in the MoE layer, which directly affects FLOPs and activation memory consumption during pre-training and inference. However, PEER could potentially be adapted to retrieve a large number of PEFT adapters. Retrieval-Augmented Models Our proposed method, with its retrieval mechanism for a large number of experts, aligns with the emerging field of retrieval-augmented models. These models facilitate large model memorization by retrieving knowledge from external databases, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency on knowledge-intensive tasks. Some notable works in this domain include ones by Khandelwal et al. (2019); Borgeaud et al. (2022a); Guu et al. (2020). While these methods retrieve data in various formats, for instance, tokens (Khandelwal et al. 2019), chunks (Borgeaud et al. 2022b) or knowledge graphs (Kang et al., 2023) (see (Gao et al. 2023) for a comprehensive survey on this topic), they differ from the proposed method in that they retrieve data rather than learned functions (experts). This distinction sets our parameter-efficient expert retrieval approach apart from existing retrieval-augmented models. Efficient Feedforward Layers Enhancing the efficiency of feedforward networks has been a long-standing area of research. Similar to PEER, most approaches are based on the idea of conditional computation (Bengio, 2013), where a gating mechanism is trained to determine which subset of neurons to compute. For instance, Davis \\& Arel (2013) utilized low-rank weight matrix approximation to estimate the sign of prenonlinearity activations. Neurons with negative activations are omitted as they will produce zeros after the nonlinearity. Bengio et al. (2015) explored reinforcement learning to develop an activation-dependant policy for dropping blocks of neurons. More recently, Belcak \\& Wattenhofer (2023) introduced the Fast FeedForward (FFF) layer that employs a differentiable balanced binary tree to select a neuron block for computation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/21 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1525-1534, Berlin, Germany, August 2016.

However, MoWE is language-specific and uses a fixed routing scheme. Theoretical and empirical evidence (Clark et al. 2022 Dikkala et al. 2023) highlights the advantages of learned routers over non-trainable ones. Thus, an MoE design with a learned router scalable to over a million experts remains an open area for exploration. This work introduces the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) architecture, leveraging product key retrieval (Lample et al. 2019) for efficient routing to an extremely large number of experts, decoupling computational cost from parameter count. This design demonstrates a superior compute-performance tradeoff in our experiments, positioning it as a competitive alternative to dense FFW layers for scaling foundation models. The main contributions of this work are:\n\n- Exploration of Extreme MoE Setting: Deviating from the focus on a small number of large experts in previous MoE research, this work investigates the under-explored case of numerous tiny experts. - Learned Index Structure for Routing: Demonstrating for the first time that a learned index structure (Kraska et al. 2018) can efficiently route to over a million experts. - New Layer Design: Combining product key routing with single-neuron experts, we introduce the PEER layer that expands layer capacity without significant computational overheads. Empirical results demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs and Product Key Memory (PKM) layers. - Comprehensive Ablation Studies: We investigate the impact of different design choices of PEER such as number of experts, active parameters, number of heads and query batch normalization on language modeling tasks. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-03.jpg?height=562&width=1381&top_left_y=277&top_left_x=337)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the PEER layer. A PEER layer can be inserted in the middle of a transformer backbone or can be used to replace FFW layers. Given the state vector $x$ from the previous layer, a query network $q$ maps it to a query vector $q(x)$, which is then compared with the product keys to compute the router scores and to retrieve the top $k$ experts $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{k}$. After the retrieved experts make their predictions $e_{i}(x)$, their outputs are linearly combined using the softmax-normalized router scores as weights. ## 2 Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) layer, which is a Mixture of Experts architecture using product keys (Lample et al., 2019) in the router and single-neuron MLPs as experts. Fig. 2 illustrates the computational process within a PEER layer. PEER Overview Formally, a PEER layer is a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that consists of three parts: a pool of $N$ experts $\\mathbb{E}:=\\left\\{e_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where each expert $e_{i}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ shares the same signature as $f$, a corresponding set of $N$ product keys $\\mathbb{K}:=\\left\\{k_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and a query network $q: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that maps the input vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a query vector $q(x)$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nThe $x$ axis is in $\\log$ scale. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe past few years have seen the power of scaling (Kaplan et al. 2020 Hoffmann et al. 2022): increasing the number of parameters, amount of training data, or the computational budget has proven to be a reliable\nway to improve model performance. Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nDuring inference, only one leaf (corresponding to one block) is selected, hence it has $O(\\log (N))$ complexity, where $N$ is the total number of blocks in the tree. However, during training, all leaves and intermediate nodes are activated for gradient calculation, imposing a training complexity of $O(N)$ and limiting the total number of blocks. The most relevant work to ours is the Product Key Memory (PKM) (Lample et al., 2019), whose retrieval technique is utilized as the router in the PEER layer. However, PKM retrieves memory vectors instead of functions, thus their values cannot vary according to the inputs. As we show in Section 3 by changing the memory vectors to input-dependent expert networks, PEER can achieve significantly higher efficiency than PKM. Finally, Csord\u00e1s et al. (2023) presented a unified view encompassing FFW, MoE and PKM and proposed to change the router normalization function in MoE and PKM from softmax to sigmoid or ReLU. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces a fine-grained MoE architecture that decomposes an extremely wide dense feedforward layer into a large number of small experts. This design is supported by the recent discovery of the finegrained MoE scaling law. To overcome the computational overhead of routing to a large number of experts, we apply the product keys to efficiently select a small subset of hidden neurons within a wide MLP layer. Empirical analysis using language modeling tasks demonstrate that given the same compute budget, PEER significantly outperforms dense transformers, coarse-grained MoEs and product key memory layers. ## Acknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Adam Santoro, Arthur Guez, Arthur Szlam, Andrei Rusu, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Simon Schug, Utku Evci, Doina Precup and Razvan Pascanu for their insightful discussions and invaluable advice.

Taming Sparsely Activated Transformer with Stochastic Experts\n\n*From Search Query: mixture of experts gating mechanisms*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Young Jin Kim, Hany Hassan, Ruofei Zhang, T. Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts), which is trained using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make consistent predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can easily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without significant increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be parameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better performance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by exploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such research might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used routing methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly routing inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model, THOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models, such as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each input during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a consistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data but also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make consistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine translation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient in that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across various settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms the Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as that of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

MVMoE: Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver with Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: mixture of experts gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jianan Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Chi Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation, and develops a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention. However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity. Experimentally, our method significantly promotes zero-shot generalization performance on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting and real-world benchmark instances. We further conduct extensive studies on the effect of MoE configurations in solving VRPs, and observe the superiority of hierarchical gating when facing out-of-distribution data.

A Mixture-of-Experts Model for Antonym-Synonym Discrimination\n\n*From Search Query: mixture of experts gating mechanisms*\n\n*Zhipeng Xie, Nan Zeng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes two underlying hypotheses and employs the mixture-of-experts framework as a solution to discrimination between antonyms and synonyms, which works on the basis of a divide-and-conquer strategy.\n\n**Abstract:** Discrimination between antonyms and synonyms is an important and challenging NLP task. Antonyms and synonyms often share the same or similar contexts and thus are hard to make a distinction. This paper proposes two underlying hypotheses and employs the mixture-of-experts framework as a solution. It works on the basis of a divide-and-conquer strategy, where a number of localized experts focus on their own domains (or subspaces) to learn their specialties, and a gating mechanism determines the space partitioning and the expert mixture. Experimental results have shown that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the task.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Best Practices of Activation Patching in Language Models: Metrics and Methods\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu activation variants*\n\n*Fred Zhang, Neel Nanda*\n\n**TL;DR:** In several settings of localization and circuit discovery in language models, it is found that varying these hyperparameters could lead to disparate interpretability results.\n\n**Abstract:** Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the internal mechanisms of machine learning models, where localization -- identifying the important model components -- is a key step. Activation patching, also known as causal tracing or interchange intervention, is a standard technique for this task (Vig et al., 2020), but the literature contains many variants with little consensus on the choice of hyperparameters or methodology. In this work, we systematically examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including evaluation metrics and corruption methods. In several settings of localization and circuit discovery in language models, we find that varying these hyperparameters could lead to disparate interpretability results. Backed by empirical observations, we give conceptual arguments for why certain metrics or methods may be preferred. Finally, we provide recommendations for the best practices of activation patching going forwards.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. Multi-Bias Non-linear Activation in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu activation variants*\n\n*Hongyang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a multi-bias non-linear activation (MBA) layer after the convolution layer to decouple the responses to a convolution kernel into multiple maps by multi-thresholding magnitudes, thus generating more patterns in the feature space at a low computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** As a widely used non-linear activation, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) separates noise and signal in a feature map by learning a threshold or bias. However, we argue that the classification of noise and signal not only depends on the magnitude of responses, but also the context of how the feature responses would be used to detect more abstract patterns in higher layers. In order to output multiple response maps with magnitude in different ranges for a particular visual pattern, existing networks employing ReLU and its variants have to learn a large number of redundant filters. In this paper, we propose a multi-bias non-linear activation (MBA) layer to explore the information hidden in the magnitudes of responses. It is placed after the convolution layer to decouple the responses to a convolution kernel into multiple maps by multi-thresholding magnitudes, thus generating more patterns in the feature space at a low computational cost. It provides great flexibility of selecting responses to different visual patterns in different magnitude ranges to form rich representations in higher layers. Such a simple and yet effective scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Noisy Activation Functions\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu activation variants*\n\n*\u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Marcin Moczulski, Misha Denil, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that the gradients may flow easily, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would yield zero gradient, and establishes connections to simulated annealing, making it easier to optimize hard objective functions.\n\n**Abstract:** Common nonlinear activation functions used in neural networks can cause training difficulties due to the saturation behavior of the activation function, which may hide dependencies that are not visible to vanilla-SGD (using first order gradients only). Gating mechanisms that use softly saturating activation functions to emulate the discrete switching of digital logic circuits are good examples of this. We propose to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that the gradients may flow easily, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would yield zero gradient. Large noise will dominate the noise-free gradient and allow stochastic gradient descent toexplore more. By adding noise only to the problematic parts of the activation function, we allow the optimization procedure to explore the boundary between the degenerate (saturating) and the well-behaved parts of the activation function. We also establish connections to simulated annealing, when the amount of noise is annealed down, making it easier to optimize hard objective functions. We find experimentally that replacing such saturating activation functions by noisy variants helps training in many contexts, yielding state-of-the-art or competitive results on different datasets and task, especially when training seems to be the most difficult, e.g., when curriculum learning is necessary to obtain good results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 269  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 7. Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse expert routing*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8.

Lewis, Shruti Bhosale, Tim Dettmers, Naman Goyal, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new balanced assignment of experts (BASE) layer for large language models that greatly simplifies existing high capacity sparse layers and improves efficiency by guaranteeing balanced compute loads, and also simplifies training by not requiring any new hyperparameters or auxiliary losses.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new balanced assignment of experts (BASE) layer for large language models that greatly simplifies existing high capacity sparse layers. Sparse layers can dramatically improve the efficiency of training and inference by routing each token to specialized expert modules that contain only a small fraction of the model parameters. However, it can be difficult to learn balanced routing functions that make full use of the available experts; existing approaches typically use routing heuristics or auxiliary expert-balancing loss functions. In contrast, we formulate token-to-expert allocation as a linear assignment problem, allowing an optimal assignment in which each expert receives an equal number of tokens. This optimal assignment scheme improves efficiency by guaranteeing balanced compute loads, and also simplifies training by not requiring any new hyperparameters or auxiliary losses.

Sparse Backpropagation for MoE Training\n\n*From Search Query: sparse expert routing*\n\n*Liyuan Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** One defining characteristic of Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models is their\ncapacity for conducting sparse computation via expert routing, leading to\nremarkable scalability. However, backpropagation, the cornerstone of deep\nlearning, requires dense computation, thereby posting challenges in MoE\ngradient computations. Here, we introduce SparseMixer, a scalable gradient\nestimator that bridges the gap between backpropagation and sparse expert\nrouting. Unlike typical MoE training which strategically neglects certain\ngradient terms for the sake of sparse computation and scalability, SparseMixer\nprovides scalable gradient approximations for these terms, enabling reliable\ngradient estimation in MoE training. Grounded in a numerical ODE framework,\nSparseMixer harnesses the mid-point method, a second-order ODE solver, to\ndeliver precise gradient approximations with negligible computational overhead.\nApplying SparseMixer to Switch Transformer on both pre-training and machine\ntranslation tasks, SparseMixer showcases considerable performance gain,\naccelerating training convergence up to 2 times.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-01T22:43:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-01T22:43:57Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: mixture of experts gating mechanisms*\n\n*Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the speed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse Mixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. MoE++: Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Methods with Zero-Computation Experts\n\n*From Search Query: mixture of experts gating mechanisms*\n\n*Shuicheng Yan, Li Yuan, Bo Zhu, Peng Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we aim to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods. To achieve this, we propose MoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both Feed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we introduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace operations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low Computing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within vanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs, be adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High Performance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++ allows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater performance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that zero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all zero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed across different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each token to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the appropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++ achieves better performance while delivering 1.1-2.1x expert forward throughput compared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation for developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: sparse expert routing*\n\n*Noam Shazeer, Barret Zoph, William Fedus*\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. On the Representation Collapse of Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: sparse expert routing*\n\n*Furu Wei, Heyan Huang, Xian-Ling Mao, Xia Song, Payal Bajaj, Saksham Singhal, Barun Patra, Shuming Ma, Damai Dai, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Zewen Chi*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of experts provides larger model capacity while requiring a constant computational overhead. It employs the routing mechanism to distribute input tokens to the best-matched experts according to their hidden representations. However, learning such a routing mechanism encourages token clustering around expert centroids, implying a trend toward representation collapse. In this work, we propose to estimate the routing scores between tokens and experts on a low-dimensional hypersphere. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual language model pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Experimental results across seven multilingual benchmarks show that our method achieves consistent gains. We also present a comprehensive analysis on the representation and routing behaviors of our models. Our method alleviates the representation collapse issue and achieves more consistent routing than the baseline mixture-of-experts methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design using the concepts of Mixture of Experts (MoE), gated activation functions like SwiGLU, and efficient routing mechanisms, here are some key points and references that address the specified details:\n\n## Integration of Mixture of Experts with Gated Activation Functions\n\n- The integration of MoE with gated activation functions, such as SwiGLU, is not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, but we can infer from the general principles of MoE and gated activations. MoE models replace traditional dense layers with sparse layers consisting of multiple experts, each of which can be equipped with different activation functions, including variants of SwiGLU. This integration can potentially enhance the model's capacity and efficiency by allowing different experts to specialize in different types of input data.\n\n## Training Stability and Load Balancing in MoE Models\n\n- Training stability and load balancing are crucial in MoE models. The use of a router or gating network helps in load balancing by ensuring that the workload is distributed evenly among the experts. This is achieved through the learning of gating weights that determine which experts to activate for each input. Effective load balancing strategies include ensuring that the gating network assigns experts in a way that minimizes the loss and prevents expert collapse or underutilization.\n- The paper on \"Mixture of Experts for Implicit Neural Representations\" discusses novel conditioning and pretraining methods for the gating network, which can improve convergence and stability during training.\n\n## Efficient Routing Mechanisms for Sparse Expert Models\n\n- Efficient routing mechanisms are a key component of MoE models. The router or gating network determines which experts to activate for each input, allowing for sparse activation and reducing computational costs. The use of gate embedding and gate projection matrices in MoE models helps in selecting the appropriate experts based on the input, ensuring efficient routing.\n- The \"Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) Models\" article explains how the router evaluates the input and selects which experts will be used, enabling sparse activation and reducing computational requirements.\n\n## Interactions Between Multiple Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- The interactions between multiple gating mechanisms, such as those in SwiGLU and MoE, are important for understanding the overall behavior of the model. The gate embedding and gate projection matrices in MoE models perform similar functions to the gating mechanisms in SwiGLU, determining which experts or neurons to activate. This can lead to correlations between the gate vectors and expert weights, indicating that they learn similar knowledge to effectively perform the choosing operation.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of MoE Architectures\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations of MoE architectures are critical for scaling large language models. Google\u2019s GShard and Switch Transformers are examples of MoE implementations that achieve efficiency in computation and training by reducing resource usage while maintaining high performance. These models use expert parallelism to split the model across multiple devices, allowing for larger models to be trained within the same compute budget.\n- Amazon SageMaker's expert parallelism feature integrates with NVIDIA Megatron to handle splitting experts across GPU devices, enabling efficient training and inference for MoE models.\n\nIn summary, the integration of MoE with gated activation functions like SwiGLU can enhance model capacity and efficiency. Efficient routing mechanisms, such as those using gate embedding and projection matrices, are crucial for sparse expert models. Ensuring training stability through load balancing and understanding the interactions between gating mechanisms are also vital. Finally, hardware-efficient implementations using expert parallelism can significantly improve the scalability of these models.\n",

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/27 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10819-10829, 2022.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form.

This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1. Central to the design of gated linear attention is the parameterization of $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ which requires a balance between parameter-efficiency, state size, and training efficiency.

Mao (2022) propose a more efficient outer-product-based low-rank parameterization $\\left(\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{t}\\right)$, which requires $d \\cdot d_{v}+d \\cdot d_{k}$ parameters. ${ }^{4}$\n\nIn Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ is obtained by combining a data-independent learnable matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ with a data-dependent vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}$, which allows the matrix to be full rank. However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E.

Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/37 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nB., Azencot, O., Queiruga, A., Hodgkinson, L., and Mahoney, M.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\non pp. 2, 3, 5, 16).

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length.

How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants neural networks*\n\n*Keyulu Xu, Weihua Hu, J. Leskovec, S. Jegelka*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures, and develops a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 6606  (*Influential: 1401*)\n\n#### 2. Path Neural Networks: Expressive and Accurate Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants neural networks*\n\n*Gaspard Michel, Giannis Nikolentzos, J. Lutzeyer, M. Vazirgiannis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper derives three different variants of the PathNN model that aggregate single shortest paths, all shortest paths and all simple paths of length up to K, and proves that two of these variants are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, and experimentally validate the theoretical results.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently become the standard approach for learning with graph-structured data. Prior work has shed light into their potential, but also their limitations. Unfortunately, it was shown that standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power. These models are no more powerful than the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. In this paper, we propose Path Neural Networks (PathNNs), a model that updates node representations by aggregating paths emanating from nodes. We derive three different variants of the PathNN model that aggregate single shortest paths, all shortest paths and all simple paths of length up to K. We prove that two of these variants are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, and we experimentally validate our theoretical results. We find that PathNNs can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by 1-WL, while our most expressive PathNN variant can even distinguish between 3-WL indistinguishable graphs. The different PathNN variants are also evaluated on graph classification and graph regression datasets, where in most cases, they outperform the baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Fine-grained Expressivity of Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: swiglu variants neural networks*\n\n*Jan B\u00f6ker, R. Levie, Ningyuan Huang, Soledad Villar, Christopher Morris*\n\n**TL;DR:** A theoretical framework for graph and graphon similarity combining various topological variants of classical characterizations of the $1-WL is provided, and the expressive power of MPNNs is characterized in terms of the tree distance, which is a graph distance based on the concept of fractional isomorphisms, and substructure counts via tree homomorphisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Numerous recent works have analyzed the expressive power of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs), primarily utilizing combinatorial techniques such as the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman test ($1$-WL) for the graph isomorphism problem. However, the graph isomorphism objective is inherently binary, not giving insights into the degree of similarity between two given graphs. This work resolves this issue by considering continuous extensions of both $1$-WL and MPNNs to graphons. Concretely, we show that the continuous variant of $1$-WL delivers an accurate topological characterization of the expressive power of MPNNs on graphons, revealing which graphs these networks can distinguish and the level of difficulty in separating them. We identify the finest topology where MPNNs separate points and prove a universal approximation theorem. Consequently, we provide a theoretical framework for graph and graphon similarity combining various topological variants of classical characterizations of the $1$-WL. In particular, we characterize the expressive power of MPNNs in terms of the tree distance, which is a graph distance based on the concept of fractional isomorphisms, and substructure counts via tree homomorphisms, showing that these concepts have the same expressive power as the $1$-WL and MPNNs on graphons. Empirically, we validate our theoretical findings by showing that randomly initialized MPNNs, without training, exhibit competitive performance compared to their trained counterparts. Moreover, we evaluate different MPNN architectures based on their ability to preserve graph distances, highlighting the significance of our continuous $1$-WL test in understanding MPNNs' expressivity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gating mechanisms*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 5. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gating mechanisms*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Although existing commonsense question answering works based on fully fine-tuned PLMs have achieved promising results, they suffer from prohibitive computation costs as well as poor interpretability. Some works improve the PLMs by incorporating knowledge to provide certain evidence, via elaborately designed GNN modules which require expertise. In this paper, we propose a simple knowledgeable parameter efficient tuning network to couple PLMs with external knowledge for commonsense question answering. Specifically, we design a trainable parameter-sharing adapter attached to a parameter-freezing PLM to incorporate knowledge at a small cost. The adapter is equipped with both entity- and query-related knowledge via two auxiliary knowledge-related tasks (i.e., span masking and relation discrimination). To make the adapter focus on the relevant knowledge, we design gating and attention mechanisms to respectively filter and fuse the query information from the PLM. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that KPE is parameter-efficient and can effectively incorporate knowledge for improving commonsense question answering.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gating mechanisms*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gating mechanisms*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Songlin Yang, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \\citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on SwiGLU activation function variants, hardware-efficient implementations of multiple gating mechanisms, and training stability techniques, here are some key points and references:\n\n## SwiGLU Activation Function Variants and Their Properties\n\n- The SwiGLU activation function is a combination of the Swish activation function and Gated Linear Units (GLU). It is known for its improved performance and trainability compared to traditional activation functions like ReLU. SwiGLU is defined as \\( \\text{SwiGLU}(x, y) = \\text{SiLU}(x) \\cdot y \\), where \\( \\text{SiLU}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma(x) \\) and \\( \\sigma(x) \\) is the sigmoid function.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Multiple Gating Mechanisms\n\n- For hardware-efficient implementations, techniques such as quantization and sparsity are crucial. For instance, the use of quantized versions of models, like those described in the Bielik 7B v0.1 model, includes methods such as GGUF, HQQ, AWQ, and MLX, which offer different trade-offs in performance, memory usage, and computational requirements. These quantization techniques can be applied to models using SwiGLU activations to make them more hardware-efficient.\n\n- Another approach is the use of activation sparsity. Methods like CATS (Context-Aware Training Sparsity) and ReLUfication introduce sparsity in the output of the gating mechanism (e.g., \\( W_{gate} \\)) in SwiGLU-based models, which can reduce computational complexity and memory usage without significant performance degradation.\n\n## Interaction Between Different Types of Gates in Neural Networks\n\n- In models that integrate multiple gating mechanisms, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, careful coordination is necessary. For example, using a fixed routing network to activate experts and gradually increasing the number of active experts during training can help in balancing load and improving training stability. This is seen in approaches like Sparse MoE as the New Dropout and BASE Layers, which formulate token-to-expert allocation as a linear assignment problem to ensure optimal resource utilization.\n\n## Training Stability Techniques for Models with Multiple Gating Mechanisms\n\n- Training stability is a significant concern when dealing with complex gating networks. Techniques such as query batch normalization and gradual increase in active experts during training can help. For instance, Sparse MoE as the New Dropout gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses, which improves stability and performance.\n\n- Additionally, output sparsity on the gating mechanism, as in CATS, can help in reducing unnecessary computations and improving training efficiency. This method sparsifies the intermediate state of the MLP by enforcing output sparsity on \\( W_{up} \\) and input sparsity on \\( W_{down} \\), which can lead to more stable training.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Gated Architectures\n\n- Memory-efficient implementations can be achieved through techniques like sliding window attention, which reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. This allows models to process longer sequences more efficiently while capturing local context effectively.\n\n- The use of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) instead of absolute positional embeddings can also help in better capturing relative positions of tokens, which is beneficial for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of token positions and can lead to better extrapolation to longer sequences.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers can leverage:\n- **SwiGLU variants** for improved activation functions.\n- **Quantization and sparsity techniques** for hardware-efficient implementations.\n- **Careful coordination of multiple gating mechanisms** in MoE architectures.\n- **Training stability techniques** such as gradual expert activation and query batch normalization.\n- **Memory-efficient attention mechanisms** like sliding window attention and Rotary Positional Embeddings.\n",

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n3 4}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 . 3 3}$ | $\\mathbf{1 4 . 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 9 . 0 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 4 5}$ |\n\n### 3.3 Ablations\n\nVarying the Number of Total Experts The models in the isoFLOP plot depicted in Fig. 1 all have over a million $\\left(1024^{2}\\right)$ experts.

The results are shown in Fig. 3 (a). As can be seen, the isoFLOP curve interpolates between the PEER model with $1024^{2}$ experts and the corresponding dense backbone without replacing the FFW layer in the middle block by a PEER layer.

In (a), we vary the total number of experts $N$ while keeping the same number of active experts $h k=128$. In (b), we vary the number of active experts $G=h k$ by jointly changing $h$ and $k$ while keeping the total number of experts at $N=1024^{2}$. active experts $(h k=32,64,128,256,512)$ while keeping the number of total experts constant $\\left(N=1024^{2}\\right)$. Furthermore, for a given $h k$, we jointly varied $h$ and $k$ to identify the optimal composition. The resulting isoFLOP curves, plotted over the number of heads $(h)$, are shown in Fig. 3(b). The results indicate that, within the range of values considered, higher $h k$ generally leads to improved performance. Notably, the optimal $h$ increases as $h k$ increases. However, the performance gradually saturates, and increasing the number of active experts also increases device memory consumption and may necessitate additional accelerator devices. Thus in practice, the appropriate $h k$ values should be selected based on the trade-off between performance, device number and computational resource requirements.

To analyze this, we kept an accumulated router score, denoted as $z_{i}^{\\prime}=$ $\\sum_{x} g_{i}(x)$ for each expert $e_{i}$ across all tokens $x$ within the C 4 validation set. Here $g_{i}(x)$ is the router score used to aggregate the expert output when token $x$ is given as input, with $g_{i}(x)=0$ if expert $e_{i}$ is not selected. From these accumulated router scores, we can obtain an empirical probability distribution vector, denoted as $z=z^{\\prime} /\\left\\|z^{\\prime}\\right\\|_{1}$, representing the distribution of all experts over the C 4 validation set. Then we computed the following metrics proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to assess the usage and distribution of experts:\n\n- Expert Usage: the fraction of experts retrieved during inference: $\\#\\left\\{z_{i} \\neq 0\\right\\}$\n- Unevenness: KL divergence between $z$ and the uniform distribution: $\\log (N)+\\sum_{i} z_{i} \\log \\left(z_{i}\\right)$\nwhere $N$ is the number of total experts. By default, we also added a batch normalization (BN) layer on top of the query network, as proposed by Lample et al. (2019) to increase the expert usage during training. Here we study the effect of adding this BN layer on the above-mentioned metrics. Table 2 presents the expert usage and unevenness for varying numbers of experts, with and without BN. We can see that even for 1 M experts, the expert usage is close to $100 \\%$, and using BN can lead to more balanced utilization of the experts and lower perplexities. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEER model in utilizing a large number of experts. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ea26645380338051cff2g-08.jpg?height=722&width=985&top_left_y=845&top_left_x=559)\n\nFigure 4: Query BatchNorm Ablation.

(2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparsely-gated Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) in efficiently increasing model capacity on GPU clusters, MoEs have emerged as a popular technique for scaling large models efficiently. Subsequent research (Fedus et al. 2022 Lepikhin et al. 2020 , Du et al., 2022 has proposed variations to address challenges such as load balancing, communication overhead, and training instability. These methods usually replace feedforward (FFW) layers in certain Transformer blocks with sparsely-gated MoE layers, which consist of multiple FFW layers as experts. Typically each expert matches the size of the regular dense FFW layer. Gating scores are calculated for each expert and token, and only the top k experts are activated for each token. These methods are known as token-choice methods. More recently, Zhou et al. (2022) introduced the Expert Choice routing method, where experts choose the top k tokens instead of tokens selecting experts. However, both token-choice and expert-choice methods require the top-k operator on a gating score matrix of size $N \\times M$ ( $N$ : number of experts, $M$ : number of tokens), resulting in a routing cost of at least $O(N)$. This limits their practical application to a small number of experts (typically less than 128). Instead of using the top-k operator, some works also proposed using deterministic hash tables as routers (Roller et al. 2021, dos Santos et al. 2023). With $O(1)$ average lookup complexity, these methods offer potential scalability to a large number of experts. However, these routers are fixed and not learned. Clark et al. (2022) showed that deterministic routing does not scale as well as trainable routers. Furthermore, Dikkala et al. (2023) proved theoretically that learned routers offer non-trivial advantages over their fixed counterparts, such as removing spurious directions and identifying latent clusters in data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed PEER layer employs a learned router with sublinear $(O(\\sqrt{N}))$ complexity. Since PEER uses lightweight experts, our work is also related to recent studies on parameter-efficient MoEs Wang et al. 2022, Zadouri et al., 2024). These methods utilize parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) adapters as experts instead of full-sized FFWs. Their focus is on minimizing the number of parameters updated during fine-tuning, allowing storage of only one copy of the large backbone model. In PEER, parameter efficiency refers to the small number of active parameters in the MoE layer, which directly affects FLOPs and activation memory consumption during pre-training and inference. However, PEER could potentially be adapted to retrieve a large number of PEFT adapters. Retrieval-Augmented Models Our proposed method, with its retrieval mechanism for a large number of experts, aligns with the emerging field of retrieval-augmented models. These models facilitate large model memorization by retrieving knowledge from external databases, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency on knowledge-intensive tasks. Some notable works in this domain include ones by Khandelwal et al. (2019); Borgeaud et al. (2022a); Guu et al. (2020). While these methods retrieve data in various formats, for instance, tokens (Khandelwal et al. 2019), chunks (Borgeaud et al. 2022b) or knowledge graphs (Kang et al., 2023) (see (Gao et al. 2023) for a comprehensive survey on this topic), they differ from the proposed method in that they retrieve data rather than learned functions (experts). This distinction sets our parameter-efficient expert retrieval approach apart from existing retrieval-augmented models. Efficient Feedforward Layers Enhancing the efficiency of feedforward networks has been a long-standing area of research. Similar to PEER, most approaches are based on the idea of conditional computation (Bengio, 2013), where a gating mechanism is trained to determine which subset of neurons to compute. For instance, Davis \\& Arel (2013) utilized low-rank weight matrix approximation to estimate the sign of prenonlinearity activations. Neurons with negative activations are omitted as they will produce zeros after the nonlinearity. Bengio et al. (2015) explored reinforcement learning to develop an activation-dependant policy for dropping blocks of neurons. More recently, Belcak \\& Wattenhofer (2023) introduced the Fast FeedForward (FFF) layer that employs a differentiable balanced binary tree to select a neuron block for computation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1312.4461, 2013.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/32 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2006.04768, 2020.

Patch-level Routing in Mixture-of-Experts is Provably Sample-efficient for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: expert routing mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this work shows for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, mixture-of-experts (MoE) activates one or few experts (sub-networks) on a per-sample or per-token basis, resulting in significant computation reduction. The recently proposed \\underline{p}atch-level routing in \\underline{MoE} (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. SHIELD: Defending Textual Neural Networks against Multiple Black-Box Adversarial Attacks with Stochastic Multi-Expert Patcher\n\n*From Search Query: expert routing mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Thai Le, Noseong Park, Dongwon Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm, SHIELD, is proposed, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it \u201cpatches\u201d and \u201ctransforms\u201d the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Even though several methods have proposed to defend textual neural network (NN) models against black-box adversarial attacks, they often defend against a specific text perturbation strategy and/or require re-training the models from scratch. This leads to a lack of generalization in practice and redundant computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) require great time and computation resources. By borrowing an idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it \u201cpatches\u201d and \u201ctransforms\u201d the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative enhancement of 15%\u201370% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 3 public datasets.

Merge, Then Compress: Demystify Efficient SMoE with Hints from Its Routing Policy\n\n*From Search Query: expert routing mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Pingzhi Li, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Prateek Yadav, Yi-Lin Sung, Yu Cheng, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** M-SMoE is proposed, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging and further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise to scale up the learning capacity of neural networks, however, they have issues like (a) High Memory Usage, due to duplication of the network layers into multiple copies as experts; and (b) Redundancy in Experts, as common learning-based routing policies suffer from representational collapse. Therefore, vanilla SMoE models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact SMoE model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for SMoE. The potential reasons are: (1) redundant information overshadows critical experts; (2) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address this, we propose M-SMoE, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their\"group members\"are formed; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we observed that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, MC-SMoE (i.e., Merge, then Compress SMoE), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MC-SMoE. For instance, our MC-SMoE achieves up to 80% memory and a 20% FLOPs reduction, with virtually no loss in performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

CompeteSMoE - Effective Training of Sparse Mixture of Experts via Competition\n\n*From Search Query: expert routing mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Nhat Ho, Steven Hoi, XiaoLi Li, Savitha Ramasamy, Binh T. Nguyen, Mina Sartipi, Chenghao Liu, TrungTin Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Giang Do, Quang Pham*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width. However, effective training of SMoE has proven to be challenging due to the representation collapse issue, which causes parameter redundancy and limited representation potentials. In this work, we propose a competition mechanism to address this fundamental challenge of representation collapse. By routing inputs only to experts with the highest neural response, we show that, under mild assumptions, competition enjoys the same convergence rate as the optimal estimator. We further propose CompeteSMoE, an effective and efficient algorithm to train large language models by deploying a simple router that predicts the competition outcomes. Consequently, CompeteSMoE enjoys strong performance gains from the competition routing policy while having low computation overheads. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two transformer architectures and a wide range of tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Expert Gate: Lifelong Learning with a Network of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient expert networks*\n\n*Punarjay Chakravarty, Rahaf Aljundi, Tinne Tuytelaars*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we introduce a model of lifelong learning, based on a Network\nof Experts. New tasks / experts are learned and added to the model\nsequentially, building on what was learned before. To ensure scalability of\nthis process,data from previous tasks cannot be stored and hence is not\navailable when learning a new task. A critical issue in such context, not\naddressed in the literature so far, relates to the decision which expert to\ndeploy at test time. We introduce a set of gating autoencoders that learn a\nrepresentation for the task at hand, and, at test time, automatically forward\nthe test sample to the relevant expert. This also brings memory efficiency as\nonly one expert network has to be loaded into memory at any given time.\nFurther, the autoencoders inherently capture the relatedness of one task to\nanother, based on which the most relevant prior model to be used for training a\nnew expert, with finetuning or learning without-forgetting, can be selected. We\nevaluate our method on image classification and video prediction problems.\n\n**Conference:** expert-gate-lifelong-learning-with-a-network-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-11-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient expert networks*\n\n*Yuval Elovici, Yisroel Mirsky, Tomer Doitshman, Asaf Shabtai*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have become an increasingly popular solution for network\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS). Their capability of learning complex\npatterns and behaviors make them a suitable solution for differentiating\nbetween normal traffic and network attacks. However, a drawback of neural\nnetworks is the amount of resources needed to train them. Many network gateways\nand routers devices, which could potentially host an NIDS, simply do not have\nthe memory or processing power to train and sometimes even execute such models.\nMore importantly, the existing neural network solutions are trained in a\nsupervised manner. Meaning that an expert must label the network traffic and\nupdate the model manually from time to time.\n  In this paper, we present Kitsune: a plug and play NIDS which can learn to\ndetect attacks on the local network, without supervision, and in an efficient\nonline manner. Kitsune's core algorithm (KitNET) uses an ensemble of neural\nnetworks called autoencoders to collectively differentiate between normal and\nabnormal traffic patterns. KitNET is supported by a feature extraction\nframework which efficiently tracks the patterns of every network channel. Our\nevaluations show that Kitsune can detect various attacks with a performance\ncomparable to offline anomaly detectors, even on a Raspberry PI. This\ndemonstrates that Kitsune can be a practical and economic NIDS.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, here are some key points and strategies derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Expert Routing Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- The routing mechanism, or gate network, is crucial in MoE models as it determines which experts to activate for a given input. This is typically done using a softmax function to create a probability distribution over the experts, allowing the model to select the most suitable experts for each token.\n- The router evaluates the input and selects which experts will be used, enabling sparse activation where only a small subset of experts is activated per input. This selective activation is key to the computational efficiency of MoE models.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Implementations of Expert Networks\n\n- MoE models are designed to be memory-efficient by activating only a subset of experts for each input. This sparsity reduces the computational cost and memory usage compared to traditional dense models. For example, Sparse MoE models only select a few experts, making them computationally cheaper.\n- Expert parallelism, as described in Amazon SageMaker, allows for splitting experts across GPU devices, which further enhances memory efficiency and reduces computational costs. This approach enables training larger models with the same compute budget.\n\n### Training Stability Techniques for Expert Models\n\n- Training stability in MoE models can be improved by gradually increasing the number of activated experts during training. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting and improving generalization, especially on compositional tasks.\n- Load balancing is critical for maintaining training stability. Techniques like Sinkhorn load balancing can be used to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed among the experts, preventing any single expert from being overly utilized.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimization of Expert Architectures\n\n- Hardware-aware optimization is essential for the practical deployment of MoE models. This involves configuring the model to take advantage of the available hardware resources. For instance, setting the `expert_parallel_degree` parameter to evenly divide the number of GPUs in the cluster can optimize performance.\n- Implementations should consider memory access patterns and the use of hybrid sharded data parallelism to optimize resource utilization. However, it's important to note that expert parallelism may not be compatible with certain other parallelism techniques like tensor parallelism.\n\n### Load Balancing Strategies for Mixture of Experts\n\n- Load balancing is a critical aspect of MoE models to ensure efficient resource utilization. Techniques such as Sinkhorn load balancing can be employed to distribute the workload evenly among the experts. This helps in preventing any single expert from being overloaded and improves overall model performance.\n- Dynamic routing mechanisms that adapt to the input data can also help in achieving better load balancing. For example, the router can adjust the selection of experts based on the complexity of the input, ensuring that the workload is distributed optimally.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Expert Design**: Using small, specialized experts can be more effective than having a few large ones. This approach allows for better performance and more efficient use of resources.\n- **Gating Mechanisms**: There are trade-offs between the expressiveness of the gating mechanism and computational efficiency. More complex gating mechanisms can offer better performance but at the cost of increased computational resources.\n- **Training Considerations**: Gradual activation of experts during training and careful attention to initialization and training dynamics are crucial for maintaining stability. Memory efficiency is also a key consideration for practical deployment.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models using MoE architectures.\n",

However, scaling up models by increasing the size of dense layers leads to prohibitive computational costs and memory usage. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures offer a solution by decoupling model capacity from computational load, enabling large models to be trained efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters for each input. Integrating an MoE mechanism into the SwiGluMLP unit can enhance the model's capacity and efficiency without a proportional increase in computation. This proposal aims to modify the SwiGluMLP unit by incorporating an MoE layer, addressing challenges related to training stability, load balancing, and routing mechanisms.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n\n- **Outrageously Large Neural Networks** (Shazeer et al., 2017) introduced a sparsely-gated MoE layer that significantly increases model capacity without a linear increase in computational cost.\n- **Switch Transformers** (Fedus et al., 2022) scaled Transformer models to trillion parameters by replacing feedforward networks with sparsely-activated MoE layers, demonstrating efficient training and inference.\n- **GShard** (Lepikhin et al., 2020) enabled scaling of Transformer-based models using MoE architectures with conditional computation and automatic sharding across hardware devices.\n\n### Training Stability and Load Balancing\n\n- **Designing Effective Sparse Expert Models** (Zoph et al., 2022) proposed techniques like residual routing and improved balancing losses to enhance training stability and expert utilization in MoE models.\n- **BASE Layers** (Lewis et al., 2021) simplified the training of large sparse models by decoupling expert selection from the training of individual experts, addressing load balancing issues.\n- **Hash Layers** (Roller et al., 2021) replaced traditional routing with a hash-based mechanism to assign tokens to experts, eliminating load imbalance and simplifying training.\n\n### Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n- **GLU Variants Improve Transformer** (Shazeer, 2020) explored variants of Gated Linear Units (GLU) and demonstrated improvements in Transformer models, highlighting the importance of gating mechanisms.\n- **Jamba** (Lieber et al., 2024) introduced a hybrid language model combining Transformer layers with MoE modules, showing improved performance and efficiency.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges in Integrating MoE into SwiGluMLP\n\n1. **Training Stability**\n\n   - MoE models can exhibit instability due to the sharp decisions made by the gating network.\n   - Sharp gradients from gating can lead to optimization difficulties.\n\n2. **Load Balancing**\n\n   - Without proper regularization, some experts may become overutilized while others remain underutilized.\n   - Imbalanced expert utilization can degrade model performance and generalization.\n\n3. **Routing Mechanisms**\n\n   - Complex routing mechanisms can increase computational overhead and implementation complexity.\n   - Efficient and simple routing is necessary for practical scalability.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\n- **Simplified Gating Mechanism**\n\n  - Employ a top-1 routing strategy to select the most relevant expert for each token.\n  - Use a linear projection for gating to reduce complexity.\n\n- **Training Stabilization Techniques**\n\n  - Integrate residual connections in the gating network to improve gradient flow.\n  - Apply auxiliary load balancing losses to encourage even expert utilization.\n\n- **Compatibility with SwiGluMLP Structure**\n\n  - Leverage the existing SwiGLU gating mechanisms to integrate the MoE layer seamlessly.\n  - Ensure that the modifications are localized to the SwiGluMLP unit.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection SwiGluMLP```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nWe propose to modify the **SwiGluMLP** unit by integrating a Mixture of Experts mechanism, resulting in the **ExpertSwiGLU** unit.
