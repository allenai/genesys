Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/43 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2303.09752, 2023.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2017); Brown et al. (2020); Touvron et al. (2023); Scao et al. (2022) have shown their impressive performance in many language tasks Zhao et al. (2023). However, due to the out-of-domain and distraction issues Xiao et al. (2024), the quality of the LLM's generation drops dramatically when the sequence length surpasses its context window size which is the largest training length. Such a drawback hinders the application of LLM in multi-round dialogue, conversation conduction, documents summarization, and other real tasks which often encounter very long sequences. Some pioneering works have been done for context length extrapolation. Most of them focused on optimizing the positional encoding (PE), since the PE of unseen length was identified as a major factor leading to length generalization failure. Compared with the vanilla absolute PE, the later proposed relative PE Raffel et al. (2020); Su et al. (2021), ALiBi Press et al. (2021), and NoPE Kazemnejad et al. (2023) were demonstrated to offer better generalization. However, all of them do not perform well when the sequence length is significantly longer than the largest training length. A more effective approach is to continually train or fine-tune the model on longer-length data Chen et al. (2023); Peng et al. (2023). Nevertheless, such a manner can only extend the context window to a limited length due to unacceptable training costs Xiong et al. (2023). Moreover, when the length is very long, even collecting the training data itself is a difficult task. Recently, some training-free length extension methods attracted widespread attention. LM-Infinite Han et al. (2023) and StreamLLM Xiao et al. (2023) extrapolated the length by discarding most contexts but only keeping the context at the end and the very beginning. Though these methods can efficiently deal with extremely long contexts, they lose a lot of long-distance dependencies, which leads to deviations or even errors in text understanding. PCW Ratner et al. (2023) designed chunked attention mask and reused the positional encoding for different chunks, which alleviated the restriction of the context window.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/19 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

Besides algorithms manipulating explicit position features, the success of Transformers without position encodings (NoPE) provides a new way to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE's generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads' best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE's context size. Experiments on long sequence language modeling, the synthetic passkey retrieval task and real-world long context tasks show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art length generalization algorithms.

Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding (Avg.

However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/45 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMore details are in \u00a7E.2. ## 8 Related Work\n\nLong-context language models. Many recent works on long-context LMs aim to solve the problem of positional embedding extrapolation in transformers (Peng et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023). Others fine-tune LMs on longer sequences (Xiong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Together, 2023a) or compress the context into shorter forms (Yoshida et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2021; Chevalier et al., 2023). Notably, several recent papers propose to extend the context window of LMs by modifying the attention mechanism: Xiao et al. (2024b) discover the use of \"sink tokens\" in sliding windows, and Bertsch et al. (2023); Xiao et al. (2024a) retrieve relevant tokens from a cache instead of attending to all tokens. This results in memoryefficient long-context LMs, but they have diminishing returns with longer contexts, as the same positional embedding may be seen multiple times and they can not fully utilize all tokens. The key advantage of CEPE is that it does not degrade for inputs longer than the training length while achieving great efficiency compared to full fine-tuning approaches. Techniques have been designed for specific applications, such as for in-context learning (Ratner et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2022), but we focus on general long-context language modeling. Novel architectures and pre-training methods, such as S4 (Gu et al., 2022), RPT (Rubin and Berant, 2023), YOCO (Sun et al., 2024), and Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023), also extend the context window at greater efficiency. However, pre-training is extremely expensive at scale and these methods cannot leverage existing powerful pre-trained LLMs. It is also unclear if state-space models can achieve comparable performance with transformers (Jelassi et al., 2024). Retrieval-augmented language models. Augmenting LMs with retrieval has been useful in many applications, such as open-domain question answering. Recently, combining LMs with retrieval systems for more generalized purposes has been explored: Guu et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 17 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Resonance RoPE\", \"Context length generalization\", \"Rotary positional embeddings\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2.

Cheng, Stella X. Yu, Michael Lustig*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a physics-informed deep learning framework for off-resonance correction in MRI, which is trained exclusively on synthetic, noise-like data with representative marginal statistics and allows for fat/water separation and is compatible with parallel imaging acceleration.\n\n**Abstract:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful medical imaging modality that offers diagnostic information without harmful ionizing radiation. Unlike optical imaging, MRI sequentially samples the spatial Fourier domain ( k -space) of the image. Measurements are collected in multiple shots, or readouts , and in each shot, data along a smooth trajectory is sampled. Conventional MRI data acquisition relies on sampling k -space row-by-row in short intervals, which is slow and inefficient. More efficient, non-Cartesian sampling trajectories (e.g., Spirals) use longer data readout intervals, but are more susceptible to magnetic field inhomogeneities, leading to off-resonance artifacts. Spiral trajectories cause off-resonance blurring in the image, and the mathematics of this blurring resembles that of optical blurring, where magnetic field variation corresponds to depth and readout duration to aperture size. Off-resonance blurring is a system issue with a physics-based, accurate forward model. We present a physics-informed deep learning framework for off-resonance correction in MRI, which is trained exclusively on synthetic, noise-like data with representative marginal statistics. Our approach allows for fat/water separation and is compatible with parallel imaging acceleration. Through end-to-end training using synthetic randomized data ( i.e. , noise-like images, coil sensitivities, field maps), we train the network to reverse off-resonance effects across diverse anatomies and contrasts without retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through results on phantom and in-vivo data. This work has the potential to facilitate the clinical adoption of non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, enabling efficient\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 4.

However, they fail to generalize to sequences of arbitrary length, even for seemingly simple tasks such as duplicating a string.

Ramadge*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work demonstrates that a randomly initialized and frozen transformer language model, devoid of positional embeddings, inherently encodes strong positional information through the shrinkage of self-attention variance, and derives the underlying distribution of each step within a transformer layer.\n\n**Abstract:** The use of positional embeddings in transformer language models is widely accepted. However, recent research has called into question the necessity of such embeddings. We further extend this inquiry by demonstrating that a randomly initialized and frozen transformer language model, devoid of positional embeddings, inherently encodes strong positional information through the shrinkage of self-attention variance. To quantify this variance, we derive the underlying distribution of each step within a transformer layer. Through empirical validation using a fully pretrained model, we show that the variance shrinkage effect still persists after extensive gradient updates. Our findings serve to justify the decision to discard positional embeddings and thus facilitate more efficient pretraining of transformer language models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Stochastic positional embeddings improve masked image modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary positional embeddings\"*\n\n*Amir Bar, Florian Bordes, Assaf Shocher, Mahmoud Assran, Pascal Vincent, Nicolas Ballas, Trevor Darrell, A. Globerson, Yann LeCun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to incorporate location uncertainty into MIM by using stochastic positional embeddings (StoP), which reduces overfitting to location features and guides the model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainties.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a promising self-supervised learning approach that enables learning from unlabeled images. Despite its recent success, learning good representations through MIM remains challenging because it requires predicting the right semantic content in accurate locations. For example, given an incomplete picture of a dog, we can guess that there is a tail, but we cannot determine its exact location. In this work, we propose to incorporate location uncertainty into MIM by using stochastic positional embeddings (StoP). Specifically, we condition the model on stochastic masked token positions drawn from a Gaussian distribution. StoP reduces overfitting to location features and guides the model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainties. Quantitatively, StoP improves downstream MIM performance on a variety of downstream tasks, including $+1.7\\%$ on ImageNet linear probing using ViT-B, and $+2.5\\%$ for ViT-H using $1\\%$ of the data.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Round and Round We Go! What makes Rotary Positional Encodings useful?\n\n*From Search Query: \"Resonance RoPE\"*\n\n*Federico Barbero, Alex Vitvitskyi, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107*\n\n**Abstract:** Positional Encodings (PEs) are a critical component of Transformer-based\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), providing the attention mechanism with important\nsequence-position information. One of the most popular types of encoding used\ntoday in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries\nand keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is\nuseful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance\nincreases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason.\nWe study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is\nbeing used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to\nconstruct robust \"positional\" attention patterns by exploiting the highest\nfrequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the\nlowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic\ninformation. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct\nexperiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes\nsome highlighted issues and improves performance. We believe that this work\nrepresents an interesting step in better understanding PEs in LLMs, which we\nbelieve holds crucial value for scaling LLMs to large sizes and context\nlengths.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-08T17:07:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. ROPE: Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding for Graph-based\n  Document Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Resonance RoPE\"*\n\n*Chen-Yu Lee, Chun-Liang Li, Chu Wang, Renshen Wang, Yasuhisa Fujii, Siyang Qin, Ashok Popat, Tomas Pfister*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural reading orders of words are crucial for information extraction from\nform-like documents. Despite recent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCNs) on modeling spatial layout patterns of documents, they have limited\nability to capture reading orders of given word-level node representations in a\ngraph. We propose Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding (ROPE), a new\npositional encoding technique designed to apprehend the sequential presentation\nof words in documents. ROPE generates unique reading order codes for\nneighboring words relative to the target word given a word-level graph\nconnectivity. We study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks\nincluding word labeling and word grouping on the public FUNSD dataset and a\nlarge-scale payment dataset. We show that ROPE consistently improves existing\nGCNs with a margin up to 8.4% F1-score.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-21T00:48:04Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-21T00:48:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Context length generalization\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample\nimplementation of Samba is publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context\n\n*From Search Query: \"Context length generalization\"*\n\n*Koustuv Sinha, Jon Gauthier, Aaron Mueller, Kanishka Misra, Keren Fuentes, Roger Levy, Adina Williams*\n\n**Abstract:** Targeted syntactic evaluations of language models ask whether models show\nstable preferences for syntactically acceptable content over minimal-pair\nunacceptable inputs. Most targeted syntactic evaluation datasets ask models to\nmake these judgements with just a single context-free sentence as input. This\ndoes not match language models' training regime, in which input sentences are\nalways highly contextualized by the surrounding corpus. This mismatch raises an\nimportant question: how robust are models' syntactic judgements in different\ncontexts? In this paper, we investigate the stability of language models'\nperformance on targeted syntactic evaluations as we vary properties of the\ninput context: the length of the context, the types of syntactic phenomena it\ncontains, and whether or not there are violations of grammaticality. We find\nthat model judgements are generally robust when placed in randomly sampled\nlinguistic contexts. However, they are substantially unstable for contexts\ncontaining syntactic structures matching those in the critical test content.\nAmong all tested models (GPT-2 and five variants of OPT), we significantly\nimprove models' judgements by providing contexts with matching syntactic\nstructures, and conversely significantly worsen them using unacceptable\ncontexts with matching but violated syntactic structures. This effect is\namplified by the length of the context, except for unrelated inputs. We show\nthat these changes in model performance are not explainable by simple features\nmatching the context and the test inputs, such as lexical overlap and\ndependency overlap. This sensitivity to highly specific syntactic features of\nthe context can only be explained by the models' implicit in-context learning\nabilities.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-18T00:11:06Z  (*Updated: 2022-12-18T00:11:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary positional embeddings\"*\n\n*Dawei Zhu, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and\nRAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens,\nembedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k\ntokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as\nlegal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing\nembedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional\ntraining. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for\nlong context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed\ncomprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks,\nfeaturing documents of varying length and dispersed target information.\nBenchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models.\nBased on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window\nextension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the\ncontext window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of\ntheir original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models\nemploying absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further\nfine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving\noriginal behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding\n(RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific\nmethods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for\ncontext window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k\nand E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-18T11:29:23Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-25T02:26:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Resonance RoPE\"*\n\n*Bang Liu, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Peng Lu, Ivan Kobyzev, Suyuchen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenarios in Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where models pre-trained on shorter sequences face difficulty with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences. We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. I-BERT: Inductive Generalization of Transformer to Arbitrary Context Lengths\n\n*From Search Query: \"Context length generalization\"*\n\n*Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Hyoungwook Nam, Seung Byum Seo, Noor Michael, Lan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has emerged as a vital component of state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing in recent years, brought to the forefront by pre-trained bi-directional Transformer models. Its effectiveness is partly due to its non-sequential architecture, which promotes scalability and parallelism but limits the model to inputs of a bounded length. In particular, such architectures perform poorly on algorithmic tasks, where the model must learn a procedure which generalizes to input lengths unseen in training, a capability we refer to as inductive generalization. Identifying the computational limits of existing self-attention mechanisms, we propose I-BERT, a bi-directional Transformer that replaces positional encodings with a recurrent layer. The model inductively generalizes on a variety of algorithmic tasks where state-of-the-art Transformer models fail to do so. We also test our method on masked language modeling tasks where training and validation sets are partitioned to verify inductive generalization. Out of three algorithmic and two natural language inductive generalization tasks, I-BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on four tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary positional embeddings\"*\n\n*Ahmed Murtadha, Yunfeng Liu, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Yu Lu, Jianlin Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: \\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer}.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Rotary Position Embedding for Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Rotary positional embeddings\"*\n\n*Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han, Song Park, Byeongho Heo*\n\n**Abstract:** Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) performs remarkably on language models, especially for length extrapolation of Transformers. However, the impacts of RoPE on computer vision domains have been underexplored, even though RoPE appears capable of enhancing Vision Transformer (ViT) performance in a way similar to the language domain. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of RoPE when applied to ViTs, utilizing practical implementations of RoPE for 2D vision data. The analysis reveals that RoPE demonstrates impressive extrapolation performance, i.e., maintaining precision while increasing image resolution at inference. It eventually leads to performance improvement for ImageNet-1k, COCO detection, and ADE-20k segmentation. We believe this study provides thorough guidelines to apply RoPE into ViT, promising improved backbone performance with minimal extra computational overhead. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/rope-vit\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the `MultiScaleRetention` unit of the RetNet architecture, particularly by improving positional embeddings for better context length generalization, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information:\n\n## Resonance RoPE and Its Advantages\n\n- The concept of **Resonance RoPE** is highly relevant as it is designed to improve the context length generalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) by refining the interpolation of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) features for out-of-distribution positions. This approach does not incur additional online computational costs, which aligns well with the efficiency goals of RetNet.\n\n## Implementation and Compatibility\n\n- **Resonance RoPE** can be integrated into the existing rotary positional embeddings used in RetNet. Since RetNet already employs rotary positional embeddings, replacing or augmenting them with Resonance RoPE should be feasible without significant architectural changes. This compatibility is crucial for localized modifications.\n\n## Addressing Context Length Limitations\n\n- The current limitation in RetNet, where the effective context length falls short of the training context length, can be addressed by using **ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (STRING)** or similar methods. STRING shifts well-trained positions to overwrite the original ineffective positions during inference, enhancing performance within the existing training lengths. This method has shown significant improvements in models like Llama 3.1 70B and Qwen2 72B on long-context benchmarks.\n\n## Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations\n\n- The paper on **LieRE (Lie group-based Rotary Encoding)** provides a detailed mathematical formulation of a new position encoding method that generalizes rotary position encodings. This work could offer additional insights into how to better capture the underlying geometry of position information, which might be useful in refining the Resonance RoPE approach.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Benchmarks\n\n- The evaluation of Resonance RoPE and other positional embedding methods can be conducted using benchmarks like the RULER and InfiniteBench tasks. These benchmarks are commonly used to measure the effective context length of LLMs and can help in assessing the performance improvements achieved by integrating Resonance RoPE.\n\n## Comparison with Other Methods\n\n- Other methods such as **LM-Infinite** and **Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE)** offer valuable insights but may require more significant changes to the model architecture or training regime. In contrast, integrating Resonance RoPE appears more straightforward and aligned with the goal of localized modifications.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Resonance RoPE** is a promising approach for enhancing context length generalization in RetNet without additional computational costs.\n- **STRING** and similar methods can be considered to address the effective context length limitations.\n- The mathematical foundations provided by **LieRE** could offer additional insights into refining positional embeddings.\n- Practical evaluations should be conducted using relevant benchmarks to assess performance improvements.\n\nBy focusing on these points, the researcher can effectively enhance the `MultiScaleRetention` unit of RetNet, improving its ability to handle longer sequences and generalize better to out-of-distribution contexts.\n",

Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Xiaoran Liu, Hang Yan, Shuo Zhang, Chen An, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length, and achieves extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n**Abstract:** The extrapolation capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Rotary Position Embedding is currently a topic of considerable interest. The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## B. 3 Long CONTEXT VALIDATION\n\nBesides, to validate that our proposed framework can improve the long-range real-world tasks, we also compare the close-ended subtasks included in L-Eval benchmark (An et al. 2023) within 16K context length, including the 16 -shot GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021), TOEFL-QA(Tseng et al., 2016), TopicRetrieval(Li et al., 2023a), QuALITY(Pang et al.||2022), and Coursera(An et al.| 2023). Our method is still capable of these tasks, as shown in Table 5 . For RoPE-based LLMs fine-tuned on pretraining context, namely 4 K tokens, they still have certain effects on these tasks with 16 K context\nsize, which proves one of the claims of our work, that tuning with the original pre-training context can also boost the length extrapolation. This proves that we extrapolate the RoPE-based LLM to a longer context without the disturbance of domain distribution in pre-trained data concerning the change of training context length (Peng et al. 2023). We also report the evaluation results of RoPEbased LLM fine-tuned with longer context, such as 16 K tokens, in Table 3 . Table 4 and Table 5 and the length extrapolation improvement will be further analyzed in Appendix C. |  | GSM | TOEFL | TopicRet | QuALITY | Coursera |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| LLaMA2 7B | 0.00 | 34.94 | 0.00 | 3.96 | 0.00 |\n| NTK fixed $\\alpha=8$ | 5.00 | 34.20 | 31.33 | 34.16 | 21.51 |\n| NTK dynamic | 9.00 | 37.17 | 24.67 | 30.20 | 22.09 |\n| base $=500$ | 4.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 18.32 | 19.19 |\n| base $=500$, log-scaled | 3.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 18.32 | 19.77 |\n| base $=652$ | 6.00 | 16.73 | 0.00 | 13.37 | 11.63 |\n| base $=652$, log-scaled | 6.00 | 16.73 | 0.00 | 16.83 | 11.63 |\n| base $=10000$ | 0.00 | 18.59 | 0.00 | 2.97 | 0.00 |\n| base $=40000$ | 13.00 | 34.20 | 14.67 | 22.77 | 11.63 |\n| base $=80000$ | 11.00 | 36.43 | 29.33 | 23.76 | 15.70 |\n| base $=160000$ | 10.00 | 40.15 | 38.00 | 22.28 | 16.28 |\n| base $=400000$ | 8.00 | 41.64 | 36.67 | 22.77 | 15.70 |\n| base $=600000$ | 12.00 | 38.66 | 34.00 | 25.25 | 16.86 |\n| base $=1000000$ | 9.00 | 31.97 | 34.00 | 21.29 | 16.28 |\n| base $=2000000$ | 7.00 | 30.86 | 31.33 | 22.77 | 15.70 |\n| base $=500,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 2.00 | 25.65 | 0.00 | 16.83 | 20.35 |\n| base $=10000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 5.00 | 42.38 | 0.00 | 19.80 | 13.95 |\n| base $=40000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 11.00 | 43.49 | 20.67 | 28.22 | 19.19 |\n| base $=80000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 12.00 | 43.49 | 35.33 | 30.20 | 21.51 |\n| base $=120000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 14.00 | 43.12 | 40.00 | 26.24 | 20.93 |\n| base $=1000000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 13.00 | 44.24 | 41.33 | 25.74 | 21.51 |\n| LLaMA2 13B | 0.00 | 59.48 | 0.00 | 6.44 | 0.00 |\n| NTK fixed $\\alpha=8$ | 8.00 | 58.74 | 36.00 | 35.64 | 23.26 |\n| NTK dynamic | 22.00 | 59.85 | 30.00 | 35.15 | 28.49 |\n| base $=500$ | 9.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 30.20 | 25.58 |\n| base $=500$, log-scaled | 11.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 28.71 | 25.58 |\n| base $=652$ | 12.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 30.69 | 25.58 |\n| base $=652$, log-scaled | 9.00 | 37.17 | 0.00 | 31.19 | 25.00 |\n| base $=10000$ | 0.00 | 56.13 | 0.00 | 7.43 | 0.00 |\n| base $=40000$ | 18.00 | 64.68 | 20.67 | 49.01 | 16.86 |\n| base $=80000$ | 20.00 | 63.94 | 30.00 | 52.97 | 24.42 |\n| base $=160000$ | 23.00 | 62.83 | 39.33 | 51.49 | 24.42 |\n| base $=400000$ | 17.00 | 59.48 | 34.67 | 51.49 | 29.07 |\n| base $=600000$ | 14.00 | 63.94 | 36.00 | 47.52 | 29.65 |\n| base $=1000000$ | 10.00 | 64.68 | 28.67 | 45.05 | 19.19 |\n| base $=500,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 6.00 | 20.07 | 0.00 | 21.29 | 26.74 |\n| base $=10000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 13.00 | 55.39 | 0.00 | 38.61 | 25.00 |\n| base $=40000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 25.00 | 63.94 | 19.33 | 49.50 | 18.60 |\n| base $=80000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 21.00 | 63.20 | 34.67 | 40.10 | 15.12 |\n| base $=120000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 22.00 | 63.94 | 40.67 | 39.11 | 19.19 |\n| base $=1000000,16 \\mathrm{~K}$ | 9.00 | 63.57 | 33.33 | 48.02 | 16.86 |\n\nTable 5: Long context validation results of scaling RoPE with different base and other extrapolating methods in LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b).

Surprisingly, as the base increases from 500 to 1000000, the extrapolation capability first becomes weaker and then becomes stronger. ## C EXTENSION\n\nConcerning that the current extrapolation methods in the fine-tuning phase dominantly apply longer tuning contexts, we propose an extended version of the scaling law of RoPE-based extrapolation. Theorem 3. (Extended Scaling Law of RoPE-based Extrapolation) For RoPE-based LLMs pretrained with context length $T_{\\text {train }}$ and critical dimension $d_{\\text {extra }}$, if we adjust the base to $\\beta$ and then conduct fine-tuning with context length $T_{\\text {tune }} \\geq T_{\\text {train }}$, the extrapolation performance of RoPE-based LLMs will get improved. Importantly, there exists a critical base $\\beta_{0}$ decided by $T_{\\text {tune }}$ and $T_{\\text {train }}$. $$\n\\beta_{0}=10000^{\\log _{\\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{} \\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}}^{2 \\pi}}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta>\\beta_{0}$, the extrapolation upper bound is decided by $\\beta$ and $d_{\\text {extra }}$ as follows:\n\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{extra}}=2 \\pi \\cdot \\beta^{d_{\\mathrm{extra}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{d}}=2 \\pi \\cdot \\beta^{\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil \\cdot \\frac{2}{d}}\n$$\n\nOtherwise, the extrapolation upper bound is $T_{\\text {tune }}$ and the critical dimension is updated satisfying\n\n$$\nd_{\\text {extra }}^{\\prime}=2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{\\beta} \\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil \\geq 2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil=d_{\\text {extra }}\n$$\n\nHowever, the extrapolation beyond $T_{\\text {tune }}$ will acquire further enhancement if $\\beta$ gets smaller. Particularly, when $\\beta$ is smaller than $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3}$ as follows, the enhancement will be more significant. $$\n\\beta_{1}=\\frac{2 T_{\\text {tune }}}{\\pi}, \\quad \\beta_{2}=\\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{\\pi}, \\quad \\beta_{3}=\\frac{T_{\\text {tune }}}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nTheorem 3. serves as both a combination and generalization of Theorem 1., Lemma 1. and Theorem 2. Here, the critical base is the worst base for extrapolation as well as the smallest base forcing RoPE to extrapolate depending on the feature dimensions within the critical dimension. Specifically, when $T_{\\text {tune }}=T_{\\text {train }}$, the critical base, $\\beta_{0}=10000$, relates to the intriguing observation outlined in Section 2. Equation 13 corresponds to tuning RoPE with larger bases discussed in Section 3.3, Equation 14 corresponds to the definition of critical dimension in Section 3.2 and Equation 15 corresponds to tuning RoPE with smaller bases discussed in Section 3.1 If $T_{\\text {tune }}>T_{\\text {train }}$, RoPE-based LLMs can accommodate a broader context window. As illustrated in Figure 9, when fine-tuning LLaMA2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023b) within a 16K context, the max context length exceeds or equals 16 K , surpassing the original LLaMA2 7B and 13B respectively, regardless of the base value. From a periodic perspective, since both base and training length have changed, it prompts us to consider whether additional positional information has been integrated during the fine-tuning phase for feature dimensions beyond the critical dimension, namely the 92nd dimension for LLaMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023b), as indicated in Equation 5 According to the definition of the critical dimension, based on the current base $\\beta$, we can calculate how many dimensions the RoPE-based LLM has where $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ complete a period within the tuning length. If base $\\beta>\\beta_{0}$, then $\\tilde{d}_{\\text {extra }}$, the\nnumber of dimensions that cover a period during fine-tuning have already been able to traverse a complete period during pre-training, given that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =2\\left\\lceil\\frac{d}{2} \\log _{10000} \\frac{T_{\\text {train }}}{2 \\pi}\\right\\rceil=d_{\\text {extra }}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-22.jpg?height=119&width=1140&top_left_y=385&top_left_x=449)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-22.jpg?height=148&width=876&top_left_y=498&top_left_x=798)\n\nTherefore, the critical dimension remains unchanged. Referring to Theorem 2 in Section 3.3 , we can calculate the extrapolation upper bound based on the updated base and the original critical dimension as Equation 13, exactly the same as Equation 5. For LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) fine-tuned with a 16 K context, as illustrated in Figure 9, the critical base is 71738 , given Equation 12 For bases greater than 71738 , such as 80000,120000 , and 1000000 , their extrapolation upper bounds surpass 16 K and the larger base corresponds to a longer context, corroborating our theoretical framework. If base $\\beta \\leq \\beta_{0}$, then during the fine-tuning phase, the number of dimensions able to complete a period surpasses the original critical dimension, so the critical dimension is updated as Equation 14 Besides, since this dimension depends on the fine-tuning length, the extrapolation upper bound is still constrained within the fine-tuning length $T_{\\text {tune }}$. However, if $\\beta$ is so small that the input of every $\\cos (t-s) \\theta_{n}, \\sin (t-s) \\theta_{n}$ can span values from 0 to $\\pi / 2, \\pi$, or $2 \\pi$ within the fine-tuning length $T_{\\text {tune }}$, as indicated by Equation 15, similar to Theorem 1 in Section 3.1, then the extrapolation performance will get further improved, marked by a more stable perplexity growth curve. For LLaMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023b) fine-tuned with a 16K context, as shown in Figure 9 for bases smaller than the critical base 71738 , such as $60000,20000,10000$, and 500 , the performance curves become progressively more stable. Among them, although $\\beta=10000$ performs poorly in fine-tuning at the original context length, the performance gets significantly improved this time because the inputs of cos or $\\sin$ have traversed to $\\pi / 2$ within the 16 K context length. When $\\beta=500$, LLaMA2 achieved a similar terrific performance as $\\beta=1000000$, namely the design of Code LLaMA (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), a context length with at least 100 K tokens, breaking the curse of entropy explosion mentioned in Han et al. (2023). Since there exists an upper bound for extrapolation based on $\\beta=1000000$, RoPE tuned with base 500 on 16 K context length has the potential to extrapolate to an infinite context, thus answering Q3 in the Introduction. Similarly, we also use scatter plots to visualize the fluctuation of attention scores for different bases after fine-tuning with a 16 K context as illustrated in Figure 10 . For base 500, given its exposure to enough fluctuations during the training phase, the perplexity curve remains notably stable. For base 10000 , it is clear that the fluctuation of attention scores in the last 36 dimensions is somewhat limited, leading to a noticeable improvement in extrapolation performance given Equation 15 For base 40000 , the position information acquired in the fine-tuning phase shrinks further as the base increases. For base 120000, the critical dimension goes back to 92 dimensions, and the extrapolation performance is governed by the first 92 dimensions. Remarkably, the extrapolation upper bound given Equation 13 matches the maximum supported context length. For base 1000000, the period of the first 92 dimensions is further extended, corresponding to a context length expanding beyond 100K. Eventually, based on the above interpretation, we validate the correctness of Theorem 3. and provide a unified framework to explain the extrapolation of RoPE-based LLM with arbitrary base and fine-tuning context length. ## D DISCUSSION\n\nBesides, we discuss the instructive value of our theory for other extrapolation strategies focused on achieving longer context during the testing phase. These methods are still necessary given two facts. On one hand, the performance of RoPE with a smaller base is still left behind compared with RoPE with much larger bases, such as 1000000 , as shown in Figure 1 . On the other hand, for RoPE with a base that is not large enough, it still can not extrapolate to a context of 100 K or longer as shown in Figure 2. In order to further enhance RoPE's adaptability to a longer context, whatever the base\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-23.jpg?height=692&width=1355&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=383)\n\nFigure 10: The relation between attention scores in first 92 and last 36 dimensions with the extrapolation performance in LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) evaluated or fine-tuned with different bases at 16 K context length. The meaning of each row is the same as that in Figure 6except that the second row highlights the changes in the first 32 K tokens instead of the first 16 K tokens. value is, we discuss the effect of two complementary methods in the inference phase, log-scaled attention (Su, 2023b) and dynamic-scaled RoPE (bloc97, 2023a) on RoPE with different bases. Log-scaled Attention as shown in Equation 16 is a classic technique originally raised in Chiang \\& Cholak (2022) and currently applied in RoPE-based extrapolation (Su, 2023b, Alibaba, 2023). It involves multiplying the original attention matrix by the logarithm of the current inference length $t$. Traditionally, the base of the logarithm is training length $T_{\\text {train }}$. However, given Equation 13 in Theorem 3., the attention score within the max supported context length $T_{\\text {extra }}$ is reliable. So we take $T_{\\text {extra }}$ as the logarithm base and set the lower limit for the logarithmic correction value as 1 , meaning that no additional $\\log$ scale is required within the extrapolation upper bound. $$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\cdot p_{t} \\\\\np_{t}=\\max \\left(1, \\log _{T_{\\text {exta }}} t\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nBesides Log-scaled attention, window method, such as sliding window and its variant, is also a widely accepted strategy for extrapolation, used in inference or evaluation (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). Compared with the above strict window-based method, we follow the xPos method proposed in Sun et al. (2023), shown in Equation 17, originally used in the pre-training phase. In this work, we regard this method as a soft sliding window used in the inference phase as use it as a further complement to the log-scaled method. Still, we do little modification besides using the $T_{\\text {extra }}$ as the denominator instead of the original denominator $T_{\\text {train }}$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}=\\operatorname{Re}\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{d / 2-1} \\tilde{q}_{t}^{(n)} \\tilde{k}_{s}^{(n) *} \\zeta_{n}^{\\frac{t-s}{T_{\\text {extra }}}} e^{i(t-s) \\theta_{n}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\zeta_{n}=\\frac{\\gamma+2 n / d}{\\gamma+1}, n=0 \\cdots \\frac{d}{2}-1, \\gamma=0.4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDynamic-scaled RoPE namely Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) is a widely used extrapolation. Here, we only do two little modifications. One is to change the base 10000 in vanilla RoPE ( Su et al., 2021) with the base scaled in the fine-tuning phase, $\\beta$. The other is still to replace the $T_{\\text {train }}$ in Equation ?? with $T_{\\text {extra }}$ we derive given Equation 13 in Theorem 3. $$\n\\text { for } \\boldsymbol{A}_{t, s}, \\theta_{n}=\\left(\\beta \\cdot \\alpha_{t}\\right)^{-2 n / d}, \\text { where } \\alpha_{t}=\\max \\left(1,2^{\\left\\lceil\\log _{2} \\frac{t}{T_{\\text {extra }}}\\right\\rceil+1}-1\\right)\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_923a825503608314cd10g-24.jpg?height=1221&width=1329&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=396)\n\nFigure 11: Perplexity on the validation data from Books3 dataset (Presser, 2020) of LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al. 2023b) based on RoPE with different bases enhanced with log-scaled attention, xPos and dynamic-scaled RoPE and their combination. Here, wrong means calculating $\\alpha_{t}$ in Dynamic NTK (bloc97, 2023a) or $p_{t}$ in (Su, 2023b) with training length $T_{\\text {train }}$, while correct means using extrapolation upper bound $T_{\\text {extra }}$ instead of $T_{\\text {train }}$. We experiment with these two methods on LLaMA2 7B (Touvron et al. 2023b) and get the results as shown in Figure 11. Figure 11a shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with base 10000. It is clear that both log-scaled attention almost does nothing for pre-trained and fine-tuned LLaMA2, but show great improvement for fine-tuning LLaMA2 with cutting the last 36 dimensions in $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{s}$ off. This phenomenon further proves that the fluctuation coming from the dimensions of $\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{k}_{s}$ beyond the critical dimension is the root cause of the extrapolation problem of RoPE-based LLM. Figure 11b shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with bases smaller than 10000. There is a clear trend that with the reduction of the base value, the improvement obtained from the log-scaled attention is more dominant while the effect of Dynamic NTK shrinks gradually. For RoPE with base 500 , the perplexity curve of log-scaled RoPE is flat enough, indicating the extrapolation capability to support 100 K context length. On the contrary, Dynamic NTK shows a clear side effect. Hence, the position information learned in the training phase is reliable enough for LLM to extrapolate further, corresponding to Theorem 1. in Section 3.1\nFigure 11 c shows the results on LLaMA2 based on RoPE with bases larger than 10000, such as 40000, 160000, 400000, and 600000. We do not test the performance of two methods on RoPE with base 1000000 , since it already achieved the context length of 100 K . Here, we enable RoPE with bases larger than 10000 and smaller than 1000000 to extrapolate beyond the context length of 100 K in the inference phase. For RoPE with larger bases, the improvement of extrapolation performance\nobtained from Dynamic NTK is more remarkable. The working principle of Dynamic NTK has been visualized in Figure 8 and discussed in Section 3.4\n\nBesides, replacing the $T_{\\text {train }}$ with $d_{\\text {extra }}$ becomes significantly important for RoPE with larger bases. For example, if Dynamic NTK is carried out based on $T_{\\text {train }}$, the improvement will be limited and even destroyed when the base is large enough like 400000 and 600000. This phenomenon proves the guidance value of this work for other extrapolation works. In conclusion, for a base smaller than $\\beta_{3}$ defined in Equation 1, every dimension has learned complete positional information. Then the log-scaled method is sufficient to enhance extrapolation. For a base larger than $\\beta_{0}$, namely 10000 for tuning on the original context, Dynamic NTK in the correct way is a good helper for extrapolation to a much longer context. ## E TEXT CONTINUATION\n\nFinally, we execute a text continuation as our case study. For LLaMA2 7B(Touvron et al., 2023b) fine-tuned with various base values and fine-tuning lengths, we provide a context of 32 K tokens from Books3(Presser, 2020) and prompt the model to continue writing. The resulting texts, after cleaning the special characters, are shown in Figure 12. Remarkably, whether the base is set at 500 or 1000000 , the generated text remains coherent, grammatically accurate, and logically consistent. For base 500, extended tuning length or incorporating log-scaled attention $\\mathrm{Su}(2023 \\mathrm{~b}$ ) in the testing phase yields improved continuation results. Given the strict extrapolation upper bound for base 1000000, there is a compelling case that a model fine-tuned with base 500 possesses an infinite extrapolation potential. ## LIMITATION\n\nIn this work, our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which RoPE, using either smaller or larger bases, enhances extrapolation performance. Additionally, there remains a need to find whether there exist upper and lower bounds for adjusting the base. Besides, it needs additional efforts to integrate the performance of RoPE with smaller bases in the pre-training stage. Finally, since the base value and pre-training context length are keys to extrapolation, there might be an optimal pair of base and training length for RoPE-based LLM pre-training to be discovered.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In performing the NLP tasks, the maximal length of the sequences (the context window) determined by its training processes has been one of the major limits of a pretrained LLM. Being able to dynamically extend the context window via a small amount of fine-tuning (or without fine-tuning) has become more and more desirable. To this end, the position encodings of transformers are the center of the discussions. The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding [15]. Since then, relative positional encoding schemes [32] have further increased the performance of Transformers. Currently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [30], RoPE [34], XPos [35], and ALiBi [27]. One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training. While some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length [22]. Some works have been done to overcome such limitation. [9] and concurrently [21] proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative, [6] proposed the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into account. Since then, two improvements of the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation have been proposed, with different emphasis:\n\n- the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation method [14] for pre-trained models without fine-tuning. - the \"NTK-by-parts\" interpolation method [7] which performs the best when fine-tuned on a small amount of longer-context data. The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation and the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation have already seen their presence in the open-source models such as Code Llama [31] (using \"NTK-aware\" interpolation) and Qwen 7B [2] (using \"Dynamic NTK\"). In this paper, in addition to making a complete account of the previous unpublished works on the \"NTK-aware\", the \"Dynamic NTK\" and the \"NTK-by-part\" interpolations, we present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), an improved method to efficiently extend the context window of models trained with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) including the LLaMA [38], the GPTNeoX [5], and the PaLM [10] families of models. YaRN reaches state-of-the-art performances in context window extensions after fine-tuning on less than $\\sim 0.1 \\%$ of the original pre-training data. In the meantime, by combining with the inference-time technique called Dynamic Scaling, the Dynamic-YaRN allows for more than 2x context window extension without any fine-tuning. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Rotary Position Embeddings\n\nThe basis of our work is the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduced in [34]. We work on a hidden layer where the set of hidden neurons are denoted by $D$. Given a sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}$, following the notation of [34], the attention layer first converts the vectors into the query vectors and the key vectors:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{m}=f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}=f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nNext, the attention weights are calculated as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{|D|}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_{m}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ are considered as column vectors so that $\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ is simply the Euclidean inner product. In RoPE, we first assume that $|D|$ is even and identify the embedding space and the hidden states as\ncomplex vector spaces:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{|D| / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere the inner product $\\mathbf{q}^{T} \\mathbf{k}$ becomes the real part of the standard Hermitian inner product $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\mathbf{k}\\right)$. More specifically, the isomorphisms interleave the real part and the complex part\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo convert embeddings $\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}$ into query and key vectors, we are first given $\\mathbb{R}$-linear operators\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}: \\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nIn complex coordinates, the functions $f_{q}, f_{k}$ are given by\n\n$$\nf_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right)=e^{i m \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{q} \\mathbf{x}_{m}, f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)=e^{i n \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{|D| / 2}\\right)$ is the diagonal matrix with $\\theta_{d}=b^{-2 d /|D|}$ and $b=10000$. This way, RoPE associates each (complex-valued) hidden neuron with a separate frequency $\\theta_{d}$. The benefit of doing so is that the dot product between the query vector and the key vector only depends on the relative distance $m-n$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}} \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{q}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n} e^{i \\theta(m-n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn real coordinates, the RoPE can be written using the following function\n$f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\\cos m \\theta_{1} & -\\sin m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sin m \\theta_{1} & \\cos m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & -\\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\cos m \\theta_{l} & -\\sin m \\theta_{l} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\sin m \\theta_{l} & \\cos m \\theta_{l}\\end{array}\\right) \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{m}$\nso that\n\n$$\nf_{q}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{q}}, f_{k}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{k}}\n$$\n\n### 2.2 Position Interpolation\n\nAs language models are usually pre-trained with a fixed context length, it is natural to ask how to extend the context length by fine-tuning on relatively less amount of data. For language models using RoPE as the position embedding, Chen et al. [9], and concurrently kaiokendev [21] proposed the Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context length beyond the pre-trained limit. While a direct extrapolation does not perform well on sequences $w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{L}$ with $L$ larger than the pre-trained limit, they discovered that interpolating the position indicies within the pre-trained limit works well with the help of a small amount of fine-tuning. Specifically, given a pre-trained language model with RoPE, they modify the RoPE by\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\frac{m L}{L^{\\prime}}, \\theta_{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L^{\\prime}>L$ is a new context window beyond the pre-trained limit. With the original pre-trained model plus the modified RoPE formula, they fine-tuned the language model further on several orders of magnitude fewer tokens (a few billion in Chen et al. [9]) and successfully acheived context window extension. ### 2.3 Additional Notation\n\nThe ratio between the extended context length and the original context length has been of special importance, and we introduce the notation $s$ defined by\n\n$$\ns=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{L}\n$$\n\nand we call $s$ the scale factor. We also rewrite and simplify Eq. 10 into the following general form:\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ are method-dependent functions. For PI, we have $g(m)=m / s, h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)=\\theta_{d}$. In the subsequent sections, when we introduce a new interpolation method, we sometimes only specify the functions $g(m)$ and $h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$. Additionally, we define $\\lambda_{d}$ as the wavelength of the RoPE embedding at $d$-th hidden dimension:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{d}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{d}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 d}{|D|}}\n$$\n\nThe wavelength describes the length of tokens needed in order for the RoPE embedding at dimension $d$ to perform a full rotation $(2 \\pi)$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

They typically train on text segments of fewer than 4 K tokens (Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023), primarily due to the computational overhead quadratic in the input\n\n[^0]lengths of their Transformer architectures. As a result, they face challenges in generalization to inputs that are excessively longer than what they are trained on and suffer substantial deterioration in their performance (Tworkowski et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). This limits their applicability in tasks that require long-range contexts, such as encoding scientific articles, source code repository generation, or long-context dialogues. Extensive efforts have been devoted to addressing this length generalization challenge. Relative positional encodings such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021) and Alibi (Press et al., 2021) have been widely adopted by state-of-the-art LLMs, which calculate attention based on inter-token distance instead of absolute positions, hoping to avoid model failures due to unseen absolute position embeddings. Moreover, although applying a sliding-window attention pattern on the Transformer architecture can reduce the memory overhead (Beltagy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020), they are not directly applicable to pre-trained models for length generalization without further training. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, $\\S 3$ pinpoints three primary factors underlying the length generalization failures: (1) the challenge of handling unseen distances among tokens, (2) the difficulty of attending to unseen numbers of tokens, and (3) implicitly encoded absolute positional information in initial tokens. These challenges can make LLMs' computational features, such as attention logits and hidden vectors, deviate from the training distribution, leading to failures of length generalization. Existing techniques fall short of addressing these underlying issues. Answering these challenges, we propose LMInfinite, a simple and effective method to enhance Transformer LLMs' capabilities for modeling long contextswithout parameter updates. LM-Infinite consists of two major components designed to alleviate the three factors above. (1) a $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$-shaped\nattention mask and (2) a ceiling on attention distances. The former forces the model to attend to only the beginning of the sequence and the most recent tokens within a pre-defined window, ignoring the rest. The latter component caps the relative distance values to the maximum the model has seen during training. It can also optionally re-introduce top- $k$ tokens in the middle to achieve better performance in some downstream tasks. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and applies to any off-the-shelf LLMs that use relative positional encoding and does not require any finetuning. Our experiments thoroughly evaluate LMInfinite on a variety of tasks and LLMs. On ArXiv (academic papers) and OpenWebText2 (Reddit posts) LM-Infinite facilitates zero-shot generalization for a wide range of LLMs to texts up to 200 M tokens, retaining the language modeling perplexity and generation quality. Without any parameter updates, LM-Infinite improves scores compared with the original model and truncation baselines on downstream tasks including Passkey Retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023) and Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021), which are two established benchmarks for long-context evaluation. We observe a $37.2 \\%$ gain on Passkey Retrieval and a $1.2 \\%$ gain on Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite also brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves $2.7 \\times$ decoding speed up and $7.5 \\times$ GPU memory saving over the original LLMs. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Relative Positional Encodings\n\nThe traditional absolute positional encodings provide the absolute position information, usually with the help of a sequence of vectors called position embeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kenton and Toutanova, 2019; Ke et al., 2020). They, however, have trouble when the model encounters unseen positions in inputs longer than the training length. Relative positional encodings aim to address the limitations of previous-generation positional encoding methods and consider the relative distances between tokens instead of the absolute positions. Examples include a learned attention logit bias in T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019), Skyformer (Chen et al., 2021), Sketching (Chen et al., 2022) and Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023), a fixed linear attention decay (Press et al., 2021), and rotating query and key sequences based on distances such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021; Li et al.,\n2023), CAPE (Likhomanenko et al., 2021) and XPos (Sun et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2023). Despite some promising empirical evidence, length generalization failures are still widely observed when directly applied to large language models (Kaiokendev, 2023). In what follows, we briefly discuss two widely used relative positional encoding methods. They lay out the necessary context for our onward discussion and experiments. ## Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE; Su et al.,\n\n 2021) It rotates the key and query vectors based on positions before computing the inner product. Specifically, each vector $\\mathbf{x}$ (either key or query) is split into pairs of elements $\\left\\{\\left(x_{0}, x_{1}\\right),\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right), \\cdots\\right\\}$, with each pair interpreted as a 2-dimensional vector. RoPE then rotates the vector $\\left(x_{a}, x_{a+1}\\right)$ of token $i$ with angle $\\theta_{a, i}=$ $i \\omega_{a}$, where $\\omega_{a}$ is the rotating speed associated with dimension pair $(a, a+1)$. After rotation, the 2 D vector becomes $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\cos i \\omega_{a} & -\\sin i \\omega_{a} \\\\ \\sin i \\omega_{a} & \\cos i \\omega_{a}\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{x_{i}}{x_{i+1}}$. They show that the inner product between rotated query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ and rotated key $\\mathbf{k}_{j}$ is solely determined by $\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}$, and their relative distance $i-j$. We always have $i \\geq j$ due to the causal attention mask.AliBi (Press et al., 2021) It offsets all attention logits between tokens $i, j$ by a linear term $-m(i-$ $j)$ and become $\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{j}-m(i-j)$. To this end, the MPT-7B codes implement an offset matrix as an additive term in attention logits. ### 2.2 Efforts Towards Length Generalization\n\nIn light of generalization failures observed in LLMs, one straightforward solution is to finetune LLMs on longer text sequences (Chen et al., 2023a; Tworkowski et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2023; Kiyono et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2022). These approaches do not address the underlying causes of length generalization failures and require massive training resources. Other solutions propose to grant LLMs access to longer contexts without really reading them in full (Zhou et al., 2023; Bueno et al., 2022; Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Augmenting LLMs with retrieval-based memories (Wu et al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Khandelwal et al., 2019; Kaiser et al., 2016; Yogatama et al., 2021) also make LLMs applicable to a large database. These designs, however, usually need finetuning and are not directly compatible with the existing LLMs. Our work, in contrast, facilitates zero-shot length generalization.

(a) Factor 1: Unseen distances between tokens cause attention logits to explode. (b) Factor 2: An unseen number of tokens can cause attention entropy to increase beyond the training range as the length increases. (c) Factor 3: Starting few tokens occupy a distinct feature region and should not be discarded. The two blue regions at the upper center and lower right correspond to the initial tokens that are highly concentrated but also very far from later tokens. The lower-left region contains the thousands of overlapping dots corresponding to the later tokens. similar work (Ratner et al., 2023) increases context length with attention patterns without further training. However, it is limited to the in-context learning setting. ## 3 Why do Transformer LLMs Fail to Generalize to Long Contexts? Through a series of theoretical and experimental investigations, this section aims to identify the potential causes underlying current LLMs' failure in length generalization. Our discussion assumes Transformer-based LLMs that use relative positional encodings, as this design is widely adopted in today's LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023). We use Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), which is pre-trained with 4 K -length segments, for investigation. On sequences longer than the training length, we will show that the unseen inter-token distances, the increasing number of attended tokens, and the implicitly encoded position information of the starting tokens can all make certain computational features out of the training distribution. As deep models can be sensitive to input distribution shifts, these factors need to be handled for LLMs to generalize to unseen lengths. Factor 1: challenges in handling unseen distances among tokens With relative positional encoding, the impact of positions on the attention weight between two tokens depends solely on their relative distance. As the sequence length grows exceedingly long, some distance values will surpass those seen during training. We make the following informal theoretical claim:\nTheorem 1. (Informal) For an attention mechanism using relative positional encoding, the attention logits must explode to infinities to differentiate previously unseen distances apart as the sequence length increases. The formal theorem and its proof can be found in Appendix C. We also empirically verify this on Llama-2 on the ArXiv dataset truncated down to 8 K length. We extract the attention logits of all attention heads and their maximum attention logits on different sequence lengths in Figure 1(a). It shows the average and variance among attention heads. We see that the attention logits increase to substantially larger values when the sequence length exceeds the training length of 4 K . To mitigate this issue, we conjecture that it may help to cap the relative distance values to the maximum that the model has seen during training (i.e., a distance ceiling). However, as we will see from the proposition below, addressing logit explosion leads to another challenge. ## Factor 2: attending to unseen numbers of tokens\n\n On longer sequences, tokens at later positions must distribute attention weights across a larger context. We then make the following claim that, if attention logits are bounded but the number of tokens to attend to is not limited, it can cause the attention entropy to increase beyond the training range:Proposition 1. If the attention logits are bounded, as the sequence becomes longer, the attention entropy grows to infinity. A formal statement as well as the proof can be\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_11c5204fe0643ee0c075g-04.jpg?height=620&width=786&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=224)\n(a) Proposed Solution: LM-Infinite\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_11c5204fe0643ee0c075g-04.jpg?height=606&width=789&top_left_y=228&top_left_x=1022)\n(b) A Conceptual Model of Relative Positional Attention\n\nFigure 2: (a) LM-Infinite is a plug-and-play solution for various LLMs, consisting of a $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$-shaped mask and a distance ceiling during attention.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, the accuracy of these models usually drops quickly for inputs longer than the ones used during training (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Deletang et al., 2023) - which are usually relatively short (e.g. 2048 for LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b)) to avoid the expensive quadratic attention cost during training. This has led to a significant interest in improving length generalization of Transformers - where we train the model using shorter inputs (e.g. 2048) and test the models performance on longer inputs (e.g. 8192) (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Chowdhury \\& Caragea, 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Transformers are fundamentally permutation equivariant, and are agnostic to input sequence ordering (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yun et al., 2019) ${ }^{1}$. They rely on position encodings to learn the ordering of input tokens. Popular position encodings such as Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) (Vaswani et al., 2017) and more recent Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021) do not generalize to longer contexts than seen during training (Kazemnejad et al., 2023). T5's relative positional encoding (Raffel et al., 2019) generalizes to longer contexts by using the same representation for all out of distribution (OOD) sequence lengths, but suffers from slow vector operations on modern accelerators (Press et al., 2022). Another line of recent work promotes length generalization by encoding specific inductive biases on how attention should decay with sequence length (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023). More recently, Kazemnejad et al. (2023) show that having no position encodings in decoder-only models can have better length generalization, albeit for small-scale synthetic tasks. In this work we take a functional approach to learn the relative position biases ${ }^{2}$, instead of having hard coded inductive biases, towards training language models with length generalization (focusing on decoder-only models). We propose FIRE (Functional Interpolation for $\\underline{R}$ elative Positional $\\underline{E n c o d i n g}$ ) method that i) uses a learnable function to map the input positions to biases, and ii) uses a progressive\n\n[^0]interpolation technique, which ensures bounded input for the position encoding function for all input sequence lengths, thereby enabling length generalization. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d088fcacf966257ed8c9g-02.jpg?height=410&width=489&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=1254)\n\nFigure 1: Language modeling perplexity on C4 with varying evaluation sequence lengths. Models are trained on length 2048. A functional approach to learn the biases allows the model to adapt to the given task instead of always having the same inductive bias, e.g. bias towards nearby tokens as in (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023). In particular we use an MLP to learn these biases, which we theoretically prove can represent several popular methods such as T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple in a parameter efficient manner. In fact, all our experiments use a tiny MLP with a hidden size of 32 , which is also accelerator-friendly unlike T5's RPE. Next, our progressive interpolation technique normalizes the query-key relative distance by the query position. Since for causal attention in language models the relative distance is always between 0 and the query position, progressive interpolation results in an output that is always bounded between $[0,1]$. This results in\nput sequence lengths, leading to better generalization performance. As a result, with increasingly longer sequence lengths, the positional inputs will form progressively finer grids, interpolating the positional encoding function on $[0,1]$. Inspired by the existing methods, we incorporate the following two transformations into FIRE, which we find helpful to improve the model quality. i) To encourage locality bias in FIRE, we apply the popular log transformation (Raffel et al., 2019; Chi et al., 2022) to the relative distance before feeding it to the MLP, which amplifies the input differences for local tokens. ii) Next we modify progressive interpolation with a learnable threshold in the normalizer to yield exact distances for shorter contexts. Note that both these transformations do not limit the ability of the model to learn arbitrary biases. In fact we show that FIRE learns to pay more attention to far away contexts in some attention heads. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the effectiveness of FIRE for length generalization. We benchmark FIRE as well as other positional encoding approaches on a wide range of real-world language modeling ( C 4 , arXiv, and Github), long text benchmark (SCROLLS), zero-shot long-context question answering (NarrativeQA), and natural language understanding benchmarks (GLUE/SuperGLUE). Our empirical results show the strong length generalization performance and long text modeling capability of FIRE. Our experiments on standard natural language understanding benchmarks show that FIRE is competitive on short sequence tasks as well. We further visualize the learned positional encoding of FIRE showing that it learns diverse patterns, beyond just locality bias. The main contributions of our paper are summarized below:\n\n- We propose FIRE, a new functional relative positional encoding method. Using progressive interpolation, FIRE is able to transform arbitrary input lengths into bounded domain, followed by a learned mapping. - We theoretically prove that FIRE can represent popular position encodings such as T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple, thereby unifying a class of existing position encoding approaches. - We empirically show strong length generalization behavior of FIRE, significantly improving over existing methods in zero-shot and finetuning settings on a wide range of datasets and benchmarks. For instance, it consistently delivers strongest performance on C 4 language modeling across various sequence lengths, outperforming the best baseline by 2.28 perplexity points (Fig. 1). On SCROLLS long text benchmark, FIRE surpasses all the competing methods on average by over 1 point (Table 1). - We present visualization of learned position embeddings of FIRE model showing that it can learn both local and anti-local position biases. ## 2 PoSITIONAL ENCODINGS AND LENGTH GENERALIZATION\n\nWe are interested in building Transformer models with length generalization ability, i.e., we expect that the model can be trained on sequences of length $L_{\\text {train }}$ and be directly applied to sequence length $L_{\\text {test }}$ without performance degradation for $L_{\\text {test }}>L_{\\text {train }}$ (Press et al., 2022). Length generalization requires Transformers to generalize to unseen positions during training, and designing better position\nencodings is an active line of research towards improving the length generalization (Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). In this section, we review existing positional encoding approaches with an emphasis on their length generalization abilities. More discussions on related work can be found in Appendix D. ### 2.1 Absolute Positional EnCoding\n\nThe Transformer paper (Vaswani et al., 2017) proposes Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) to endow Transformers with positional information. In particular, a (learnable or fixed sinusoidal) real-valued embedding $e_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is assigned to each position $i$, leading to an Absolute Positional Encoding matrix $\\boldsymbol{E}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{e}_{n}\\right]^{\\top}$, which will be added to the input sequence. Though simple and straightforward, APE-based Transformers usually generalize poorly to longer sequences (Press et al., 2022). ### 2.2 Relative Positional Encoding\n\nRelative Positional Encoding (RPE) is an increasingly popular way to encode positional information for Transformers. Shaw et al. (2018) are the first to introduce RPE to Transformers and their proposed method adds position encodings to the key (and optionally the value) in the attention layer, instead of the input. Raffel et al. (2019) simplify the vector representations of relative positions to scalars and use them as a bias term added to the pre-softmax attention logits. They further map any OOD sequence lengths to the same position, resulting in length generalization. This form of additive RPE has proven to be highly effective in many applications (Dai et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021). Following this, multiple additive RPE methods have been proposed to improve both length generalization and efficiency, such as Alibi (Press et al., 2022), Kerple (Chi et al., 2022), and Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023). Additive RPE. For most of these additive RPE methods, the computation of the (pre-softmax) attention logits can be unified using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{* 2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Let the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ be $b(i, j)$. Different formulations and parameterizations of $b$ lead to different RPE variants. A few examples that support arbitary sequence length include:\n\n- T5's RPE (Raffel et al., 2019): $b(i, j)=r_{\\min \\{i-j, K\\}}$, where $K$ is a hyper-parameter and $\\left\\{r_{i}\\right\\}_{i=0}^{K}$ are learnable scalars. ${ }^{3}$\n- Alibi (Press et al., 2022): $b(i, j)=-r|i-j|$, where $r>0$ is a hyper-parameter. - Kerple (Chi et al., 2022): $b(i, j)=-r_{1} \\log \\left(1+r_{2}|i-j|\\right)$ (logarithmic variant) or $-r_{1}|i-j|^{r_{2}}$ (power variant), where $r_{1}, r_{2}>0$ are learnable scalars. - Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023): $b(i, j)=r_{1} \\sum_{k=1}^{r_{2}} \\cos \\left((i-j) / 10000 \\frac{k}{d^{\\prime}}\\right)$, where $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are hyper-parameters. The above methods can be applied to longer sequences than training, but they also have several limitations. T5's RPE uses the same attention bias for all query-key pairs with distance greater than $K$, lacking representational power to distinguish between different positions in long sequences. Furthermore, it relies on vector operations that are not accelerator-friendly, making its training and inference relatively slow (Press et al., 2022). Alibi, Kerple, and Sandwich significantly bias towards local attention, making it harder to attend to more distant query-key pairs (Chi et al., 2023). This property can prevent the model from capturing long-range dependencies and lead to performance degradation on some tasks. In the subsequent section, we will present our method to overcome these limitations. Rotary Positional Encoding. In addition to the aforementioned methods, there are also several non-additive RPE variants. Among them, the most popular one in large language models is Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a). RoPE\n\n[^1]rotates the query and key vectors with an angle proportional to their absolute positions before the dot product attention, which results in attention being a function of the relative distance between the tokens, capturing the relative positional information.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Consequently, developing Deep Learning (DL) sequence models capable of effectively managing long contexts is a critical objective. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), despite their current dominance in general DL tasks, still face challenges in processing long sequences. Specifically, their quadratic complexity in sequence length makes them computationally\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-01.jpg?height=453&width=780&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: Document Retrieval Over SQuAD. We present a novel decimation mechanism tailored for Mamba, enabling it to process sequences that are x 25 times longer than the ones seen during training. The purple line shows the training sequences length. Results are shown for DeciMamba-130M. demanding, restricting the ability to train them over long sequences and very large datasets. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made in order to tackle this challenge. The most significant advancements include efficient implementations that increase the model's context length during training (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023), and context-extension methods (Chen et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2023b) designed to effectively expand the context after training. However, recent studies suggest that long-range processing is still an unresolved problem (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). One promising approach in this domain is the development of attention-free networks with subquadratic complexity, which can be trained more effectively over long sequences. In a recent line of work (Gu et al., 2021b,a; Gupta et al., 2022), the family of state-space layers has been introduced. These layers can be seen as theoretically grounded linear RNNs that can be efficiently computed in parallel via convolutions, thanks to a closed-form formulation of their linear recurrent rule. A recent advancement by Gu and Dao (2023) presented Mamba, which builds on top of an expressive variant of SSMs called Selective State-Space Layers\n(S6). These layers match or exceed the performance of Transformers in several domains, such as NLP (Pi\u00f3ro et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), image classification (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), audio processing (Shams et al., 2024), genomic data (Schiff et al., 2024), and more. In this paper, we first explore the lengthgeneralization abilities of Mamba and identify that they are relatively limited. Although Mamba layers are theoretically capable of capturing global interactions at the layer level, through a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures, we show that the main barrier preventing Mamba from extrapolating is its implicit bias towards a limited effective receptive field (ERF), which is bounded primarily by the sequence length used during training. Secondly, based on the assumption that long-context data is usually sparse, we present DeciMamba, the first context-extension method specifically designed for S6. Our method relies on a dynamic data-dependent pooling method that utilizes a hidden filtering mechanism intrinsic to the Mamba layer. We leverage this mechanism to introduce a global compression operator, which expands Mamba's ERF by discarding un-important tokens before each S6 layer. Our method significantly increases the effective context length of Mamba by several orders of magnitude while requiring a smaller computational budget. Our main contributions encompass the following three aspects: (i) identify that Mamba has limited length-extrapolation capabilities, (ii) recognize via a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures that although Mamba can theoretically capture global interactions via the recurrent state, its limited ERF prevents significant lengthextrapolation. (iii) Building on this insight, we introduce DeciMamba, the first context-extension technique specifically designed for Mamba models. This approach leverages an existing filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer. As illustrated in Fig. 8, our method effectively enhances Mamba's length-extrapolation abilities by up to eightfold, and is applicable to real-world long-context NLP tasks, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, the scientific context for discussion of long-range models is described and the necessary terminology and symbols are provided. Such models evolve in two main directions: (i) first, by adapting transformers, the most dominant architec- ture today, to be more suitable for such tasks, or, alternatively, (ii) by developing architectures with sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length. Several modern examples include Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023a), Hawk (De et al., 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al., 2024), and Mamba, the latter being the focus of our paper. Mamba. Given an input sequence $U=$ $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{L}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ of length $L$ such that $u_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, a Mamba block with $d$ channels is built on top of the S6 layer via the following formula:\n$G=\\sigma(\\operatorname{Linear}(U)), \\quad X=\\operatorname{Conv1D}(\\operatorname{Linear}(U))$,\n\n$$\nY=S 6(X), \\quad O=Y \\otimes G\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ represents the gate branch, $\\otimes$ is elementwise multiplication, $\\sigma$ is the SILU activation, Linear and Conv1D are standard linear projection and 1-dimensional convolution layers. The S6 layer is based on a time-variant SSM, which can be elaborated by the following recurrent rule:\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\bar{A}_{t} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B}_{t} x_{t}, \\quad y_{t}=C_{t} h_{t}\n$$\n\nWhere $X=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{L}\\right)$ is the input sequence of a representative channel, $\\bar{A}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\bar{B}_{t} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$, and $C_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ are the system, input, and output discrete time-variant matrices, respectively. S6 conditions the discrete time-variant matrices based on the input as follows:\n$\\Delta_{t}=\\operatorname{Sft}\\left(S_{\\Delta} X_{t}\\right), \\quad B_{t}=S_{B} X_{t}, \\quad C_{t}=\\left(S_{C} X_{t}\\right)^{T}$\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{t}=\\exp \\left(A \\Delta_{t}\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}_{t}=B_{t} \\Delta_{t}\n$$\n\nsuch that $\\Delta_{t}$ is the discretization step, Sft represents the softplus function, and $S_{\\Delta}, S_{B}, S_{C}$ are linear projection layers. Ali et al. (2024) demonstrated that S6 layers, similar to attention models, can be interpreted as data-controlled linear operators. Specifically, the S6 layer computation can be represented using the following linear operator $\\alpha$, controlled by the input (via Eq. 4 and 5):\n\n$$\nY=\\alpha X, \\quad \\alpha_{i, j}=C_{i}\\left(\\prod_{k=j+1}^{i} \\bar{A}_{k}\\right) \\bar{B}_{j}\n$$\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{L}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}C_{1} \\bar{B}_{1} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ C_{2} \\bar{A}_{2} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{2} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\ C_{L} \\Pi_{k=2}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{L} \\Pi_{k=3}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & C_{L} \\bar{B}_{L}\\end{array}\\right] \\underset{(7)}{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{L}\\end{array}\\right]}$\nIn this formulation, each output $y_{i}$ is a weighted sum of all inputs, where the 'attention weights' of all inputs $x_{j}$, i.e., the set $\\left\\{\\alpha_{i, j}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{L}$, is data-driven. We utilize this perspective to further investigate the effective receptive field of Mamba layers. ## Context Extension \\& Length Extrapolation. Over the years, several methods have been proposed to enhance the effective context length of transformers and improve their ability to extrapolate over longer sequences. Traditionally, length generalization is closely related to positional encoding. Pioneering work in the domain, introduced by Press et al. (2021), demonstrates that models built on top of original sinusoidal, rotary ( Su et al., 2024), and T5 bias (Raffel et al., 2020) positional encoding have poor length generalization abilities. It proposes Alibi, which mitigates this issue by promoting locality through the incorporation of distance-based linear biases into the attention matrix. A counter-intuitive study was conducted by Kazemnejad et al. (2024), which shows that transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) exhibit better length extrapolation capabilities in downstream tasks. Two more promising approaches are the very recent CoPE (Golovneva et al., 2024), which utilizes context-aware positional encoding, and post-training positional interpolation (Peng et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). Alternatively, a recent direction involves architectural modifications to pre-trained models followed by short fine-tuning. Such works include LongLora (Chen et al., 2023b), which proposes shifted sparse attention, and Landmark Attention (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023), which applies attention in chunks and inserts global unique tokens into the input sequences between those chunks. Our method can be considered an application of this approach to Mamba models, rather than to traditional transformers.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the **MultiScaleRetention** unit in the RetNet architecture through advanced positional encoding methods, here are some key areas and specific information that would be particularly useful:\n\n## Practical Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n### Search for:\n- Case studies or empirical results from models that have successfully integrated **Resonance RoPE** or similar advanced positional encoding methods into their architectures.\n- Technical blogs, GitHub repositories, or forums where practitioners discuss the implementation details and any challenges they faced.\n- Papers or articles that provide step-by-step guides on how to integrate these methods into existing Transformer-based models.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"Implementing Resonance RoPE in Transformer models\"\n- \"Practical challenges in integrating advanced positional encodings\"\n- \"Case studies on integrating LieRE or Resonance RoPE\"\n\n## Empirical Results and Performance Metrics\n\n### Search for:\n- Experimental results and benchmarks from recent studies that have used **Resonance RoPE**, **LieRE**, **YaRN**, or other advanced positional encoding methods.\n- Comparisons of these methods in terms of performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and robustness to varied inputs.\n- Studies that evaluate the efficiency and scalability of these methods.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"Empirical results of Resonance RoPE in language models\"\n- \"Performance comparison of LieRE and Resonance RoPE\"\n- \"Efficiency and scalability of advanced positional encoding methods\"\n\n## Alternative Methods for Context Length Extension\n\n### Search for:\n- Other novel methods for extending context length in Transformer models that could complement or enhance the current approach.\n- Hybrid approaches that combine multiple positional encoding techniques.\n- Methods that address the effective context length limitations, such as **STRING** or similar techniques.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"Alternative methods for context length extension in Transformers\"\n- \"Hybrid positional encoding techniques for Transformers\"\n- \"Enhancing effective context length in large language models\"\n\n## Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics\n\n### Search for:\n- Detailed descriptions of benchmarks like **RULER** and **InfiniteBench** that are used to evaluate the performance of models with advanced positional encodings.\n- Other evaluation metrics and benchmarks that are specifically designed to test length generalization and context handling capabilities.\n- Best practices for setting up and using these benchmarks to validate the proposed modifications.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"RULER benchmark for evaluating positional encodings\"\n- \"InfiniteBench for testing context length generalization\"\n- \"Evaluation metrics for assessing positional encoding performance\"\n\n## Mathematical Foundations and Theoretical Insights\n\n### Search for:\n- In-depth mathematical explanations and derivations of the scaling laws and critical dimensions discussed in papers like **Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation**.\n- Theoretical analyses of how Lie group theory is applied in **LieRE** and its implications for positional encoding.\n- Discussions on the theoretical underpinnings of **Resonance RoPE** and how it improves interpolation for out-of-distribution positions.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"Mathematical foundations of RoPE-based extrapolation\"\n- \"Lie group theory in positional encoding\"\n- \"Theoretical insights into Resonance RoPE\"\n\n## Avoiding Redundancy with Sibling Designs\n\n### Search for:\n- Information on the **hierretnet** and **sparseretnet** architectures to ensure that the proposed modifications are distinct and do not overlap with existing work.\n- Comparisons between these sibling designs and the proposed modifications to highlight unique contributions.\n\n### Example Search Terms:\n- \"hierretnet vs RetNetMLP modifications\"\n- \"sparseretnet vs sparse computation in RetNet\"\n- \"Unique contributions of integrating Resonance RoPE in RetNet\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to solidify the proposal, address potential implementation challenges, and ensure that the modifications are both unique and effective.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors is proposed, which enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nPress et al. [51] and Kazemnejad et al. [32] found that RoPE-based language models have poor length generalization. To address this, positional interpolation (PI) [11] is proposed to extend the context window. Following the direction, there are LongLora [12], LongRope [24], YaRN [50] and CLEX [10]. Another popular direction is additive positional encoding. For most of these additive RPE methods, the computation of the (pre-softmax) attention logits can be unified using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is defined as $b(i, j)$. Different formulations and parameterizations of $b$ lead to various RPE variants. Several methodologies that facilitate arbitrary sequence lengths include T5's RPE [55], Alibi [51], Kerple [13], Sandwich [14], and FIRE [40]. Currently, additive RPE delivers relatively robust performance in length extrapolation without necessitating additional operations. Alibi constructs the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B}$ utilizing prior knowledge, resulting in a basis matrix devoid of learnable parameters [51]. Conversely, both Kerple [13] and Sandwich [14] incorporate two learnable parameters to facilitate the learning of a bias matrix while retaining some elements of priors. FIRE suggests adopting a learnable continuous function, such as MLPs, to convert input positions to biases [40]. Observing these developments, it becomes evident that the next generation of bias matrices will likely incorporate adaptivity and flexibility. Based on this insight, we propose our method CAPE, a semantically adaptive method. ## 3 Method\n\nIn this section, we formally introduce CAPE (context-adaptive positional encoding), a new relative positional encoding approach that further enhances transformer performance. Compared with previous works on static positional encoding methods, CAPE adopts semantically adaptive positional bias matrices depending on input context. We first demonstrate that most of the popular positional bias matrices are fixed once the training is finished, independent of the input sequences. To address this limitation, we then accordingly develop CAPE that captures the implicit relationships by MLPs and adjusts the bias matrices based on input context. Furthermore, we discuss a variant of CAPE with residual connections and its extensions to multi-head transformers. ### 3.1 Additive Relative Positional Encoding\n\nFor most additive RPE methods, the computation of pre-softmax attention logits can be unified under the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is defined as $b(i, j)$. Various formulations and parameterizations of $b$ give rise to different variants of RPE. Examples of additive RPE include: (1) Alibi: $b(i, j)=-r|i-j|$, with the scaler $r>0$ as a hyper-parameter; (2) Kerple: $b(i, j)=-r_{1} \\log \\left(1+r_{2}|i-j|\\right)$ with $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are two learnable parameters; (3) FIRE: $b(i, j)=f_{\\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\psi(i-j)}{\\psi(\\max \\{L, i\\})}\\right)$, where the positional encoding function $f_{\\theta}$ parameterized by $\\theta$ is learned from data and $\\psi$ is a transformation function aimed at assigning more model capacity to local positions. We observe from the formulation of those additive RPEs that they remain static once the training process is completed and depend solely on the positions, regardless of the input context. This inflexibility and lack of adaptivity can lead to performance degradation, especially in tasks involving long-context generation and reasoning. Intuitively, the learned static RPEs are optimal on average across all training samples. However, this means they are suboptimal when considering each individual instance, as they cannot adapt to specific tasks. To address these challenges and enhance model performance, it is essential to adopt an alternative approach using a semantically adaptive RPE that depends on input context. ### 3.2 Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding\n\nFor simplicity, we first consider the single-head case and the extension to the multi-head transformer will be discussed subsequently. The design of context-adaptive positional encodings in natural language tasks is motivated by the need to capture the intricate relationships between tokens. Arora et al. [5] reveals that associate recall accounts for most of the perplexity difference between transformer, RNN-based, and convolution models. For example, we consider a consistent pairing that \"Hakuna\" is always followed by \"Matata\" in a long paragraph. This pattern suggests a reduced reliance on positional information in favor of enhancing token embedding similarity, thus allowing for 'Hakuna' to be effectively linked with a preceding 'Matata'. Similarly, in tasks involving long-context understanding and search, semantic similarity should be prioritized in the attention mechanism rather than being overshadowed by positional encodings, which can be less relevant over long distances. Consequently, the transformer should preserve information without being influenced overly by positional distance. Instead, a satisfactory PE should integrate both semantic and positional information. Therefore, a semantically dependent positional encoding approach is preferable and expected to enhance model performances. Here, we use the attention $\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}$ to represent the semantic information and positional bias matrices $\\boldsymbol{B}$ (e.g., Alibi and FIRE) to capture positional details. Then the context-adaptive PE is described by $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is an implicit function that integrates both semantic and positional data into the desired positional encodings. Thus, the pre-softmax attention logit incorporated with CAPE is formulated as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{CAPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $f: \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ is an element-wise function.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In performing the NLP tasks, the maximal length of the sequences (the context window) determined by its training processes has been one of the major limits of a pretrained LLM. Being able to dynamically extend the context window via a small amount of fine-tuning (or without fine-tuning) has become more and more desirable. To this end, the position encodings of transformers are the center of the discussions. The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding [15]. Since then, relative positional encoding schemes [32] have further increased the performance of Transformers. Currently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [30], RoPE [34], XPos [35], and ALiBi [27]. One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training. While some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length [22]. Some works have been done to overcome such limitation. [9] and concurrently [21] proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative, [6] proposed the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into account. Since then, two improvements of the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation have been proposed, with different emphasis:\n\n- the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation method [14] for pre-trained models without fine-tuning. - the \"NTK-by-parts\" interpolation method [7] which performs the best when fine-tuned on a small amount of longer-context data. The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation and the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation have already seen their presence in the open-source models such as Code Llama [31] (using \"NTK-aware\" interpolation) and Qwen 7B [2] (using \"Dynamic NTK\"). In this paper, in addition to making a complete account of the previous unpublished works on the \"NTK-aware\", the \"Dynamic NTK\" and the \"NTK-by-part\" interpolations, we present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), an improved method to efficiently extend the context window of models trained with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) including the LLaMA [38], the GPTNeoX [5], and the PaLM [10] families of models. YaRN reaches state-of-the-art performances in context window extensions after fine-tuning on less than $\\sim 0.1 \\%$ of the original pre-training data. In the meantime, by combining with the inference-time technique called Dynamic Scaling, the Dynamic-YaRN allows for more than 2x context window extension without any fine-tuning. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Rotary Position Embeddings\n\nThe basis of our work is the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduced in [34]. We work on a hidden layer where the set of hidden neurons are denoted by $D$. Given a sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}$, following the notation of [34], the attention layer first converts the vectors into the query vectors and the key vectors:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{m}=f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}=f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nNext, the attention weights are calculated as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{|D|}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_{m}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ are considered as column vectors so that $\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ is simply the Euclidean inner product. In RoPE, we first assume that $|D|$ is even and identify the embedding space and the hidden states as\ncomplex vector spaces:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{|D| / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere the inner product $\\mathbf{q}^{T} \\mathbf{k}$ becomes the real part of the standard Hermitian inner product $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\mathbf{k}\\right)$. More specifically, the isomorphisms interleave the real part and the complex part\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}, \\cdots,\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right) & \\mapsto\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|-1}+i\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{m}\\right)_{|D|}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo convert embeddings $\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}$ into query and key vectors, we are first given $\\mathbb{R}$-linear operators\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}: \\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nIn complex coordinates, the functions $f_{q}, f_{k}$ are given by\n\n$$\nf_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right)=e^{i m \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{q} \\mathbf{x}_{m}, f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)=e^{i n \\theta} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\theta_{|D| / 2}\\right)$ is the diagonal matrix with $\\theta_{d}=b^{-2 d /|D|}$ and $b=10000$. This way, RoPE associates each (complex-valued) hidden neuron with a separate frequency $\\theta_{d}$. The benefit of doing so is that the dot product between the query vector and the key vector only depends on the relative distance $m-n$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}} \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{q}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n} e^{i \\theta(m-n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn real coordinates, the RoPE can be written using the following function\n$f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\\cos m \\theta_{1} & -\\sin m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sin m \\theta_{1} & \\cos m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & -\\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\cos m \\theta_{l} & -\\sin m \\theta_{l} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\sin m \\theta_{l} & \\cos m \\theta_{l}\\end{array}\\right) \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{m}$\nso that\n\n$$\nf_{q}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{q}}, f_{k}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{k}}\n$$\n\n### 2.2 Position Interpolation\n\nAs language models are usually pre-trained with a fixed context length, it is natural to ask how to extend the context length by fine-tuning on relatively less amount of data. For language models using RoPE as the position embedding, Chen et al. [9], and concurrently kaiokendev [21] proposed the Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context length beyond the pre-trained limit. While a direct extrapolation does not perform well on sequences $w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{L}$ with $L$ larger than the pre-trained limit, they discovered that interpolating the position indicies within the pre-trained limit works well with the help of a small amount of fine-tuning. Specifically, given a pre-trained language model with RoPE, they modify the RoPE by\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\frac{m L}{L^{\\prime}}, \\theta_{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L^{\\prime}>L$ is a new context window beyond the pre-trained limit. With the original pre-trained model plus the modified RoPE formula, they fine-tuned the language model further on several orders of magnitude fewer tokens (a few billion in Chen et al. [9]) and successfully acheived context window extension. ### 2.3 Additional Notation\n\nThe ratio between the extended context length and the original context length has been of special importance, and we introduce the notation $s$ defined by\n\n$$\ns=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{L}\n$$\n\nand we call $s$ the scale factor. We also rewrite and simplify Eq. 10 into the following general form:\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ are method-dependent functions. For PI, we have $g(m)=m / s, h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)=\\theta_{d}$. In the subsequent sections, when we introduce a new interpolation method, we sometimes only specify the functions $g(m)$ and $h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$. Additionally, we define $\\lambda_{d}$ as the wavelength of the RoPE embedding at $d$-th hidden dimension:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{d}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{d}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 d}{|D|}}\n$$\n\nThe wavelength describes the length of tokens needed in order for the RoPE embedding at dimension $d$ to perform a full rotation $(2 \\pi)$.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Moreover, when applied to\nYaRN, RESONANCE RoPE further improves LLM's length extrapolation ability, as evidenced by lower perplexity in upstream TSTL language modeling and enhanced outcomes in downstream tasks involving lengthy contexts. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Scaling of RoPE Position Encoding\n\nRecent efforts in extending LLMs' context window focus on manipulating position embedding (PE), particularly RoPE (Su et al., 2024), which is used in LLMs like LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023). Main strategies include embedding scaling (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2024) and randomizing token positions (Ruoss et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024). Our emphasis is on the embedding scaling strategies. Existing embedding scaling strategies adjust position embedding for longer sequences to match the pre-training range, avoiding feature extrapolation. For instance, Chen et al. (2023) compresses position indices to fit the pre-training range, extending LLaMA's (Touvron et al., 2023a) context to 16 K with 1,000 steps of fine-tuning.

CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in Transformers for Long Context Window Extending\n\n*From Search Query: \"Resonance RoPE integration\"*\n\n*Shiyi Zhu, Jingting Ye, Wei Jiang, Siqiao Xue, Qi Zhang, Yifan Wu, Jianguo Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (Collinear Constrained Attention), which enforces a collinear constraint between Q and K to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention, and provides an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention and position embedding are two key modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors harming long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention unveiled by our work. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (Collinear Constrained Attention). Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between $Q$ and $K$ to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention. While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive experiments show that CoCA performs extraordinarily well in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can seamlessly extend the context window up to 32K (60$\\times$), without any fine-tuning. Additionally, by dropping CoCA in LLaMA-7B, we achieve extrapolation up to 32K within only 2K training length.

Chaudhari*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoised Diffusion MRI (DDM$^2), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoised using diffusiondenoising generative models that integrates statistic-based denoizing theory into diffusion models and performs denoise through conditional generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common and life-saving medical imaging technique. However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM$^2$), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM$^2$ demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. A Fast and Accurate Splitting Method for Optimal Transport: Analysis and Implementation\n\n*From Search Query: \"YaRN method implementation\"*\n\n*Vien V. Mai, Jacob Lindb\u00e4ck, M. Johansson*\n\n**Abstract:** We develop a fast and reliable method for solving large-scale optimal transport (OT) problems at an unprecedented combination of speed and accuracy. Built on the celebrated Douglas-Rachford splitting technique, our method tackles the original OT problem directly instead of solving an approximate regularized problem, as many state-of-the-art techniques do. This allows us to provide sparse transport plans and avoid numerical issues of methods that use entropic regularization. The algorithm has the same cost per iteration as the popular Sinkhorn method, and each iteration can be executed efficiently, in parallel. The proposed method enjoys an iteration complexity $O(1/\\epsilon)$ compared to the best-known $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ of the Sinkhorn method. In addition, we establish a linear convergence rate for our formulation of the OT problem. We detail an efficient GPU implementation of the proposed method that maintains a primal-dual stopping criterion at no extra cost. Substantial experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, both in terms of computation times and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Chao, Yue Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training and advancing the democratization of multilingual LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely\"superficial\". We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Automatic Integration for Spatiotemporal Neural Point Processes\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE integration challenges\"*\n\n*Zihao Zhou, Rose Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel paradigm: AutoSTPP (Automatic Integration for Spatiotemporal Neural Point Processes) that extends the dual network approach to 3D STPP and introduces a decomposable parametrization for the integral network using ProdNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning continuous-time point processes is essential to many discrete event forecasting tasks. However, integration poses a major challenge, particularly for spatiotemporal point processes (STPPs), as it involves calculating the likelihood through triple integrals over space and time. Existing methods for integrating STPP either assume a parametric form of the intensity function, which lacks flexibility; or approximating the intensity with Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces numerical errors. Recent work by Omi et al. [2019] proposes a dual network approach for efficient integration of flexible intensity function. However, their method only focuses on the 1D temporal point process. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm: AutoSTPP (Automatic Integration for Spatiotemporal Neural Point Processes) that extends the dual network approach to 3D STPP. While previous work provides a foundation, its direct extension overly restricts the intensity function and leads to computational challenges. In response, we introduce a decomposable parametrization for the integral network using ProdNet. This approach, leveraging the product of simplified univariate graphs, effectively sidesteps the computational complexities inherent in multivariate computational graphs. We prove the consistency of AutoSTPP and validate it on synthetic data and benchmark real-world datasets. AutoSTPP shows a significant advantage in recovering complex intensity functions from irregular spatiotemporal events, particularly when the intensity is sharply localized.

However, previous efforts like BioT5 faced challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks and lacked a nuanced understanding of molecular structures, particularly in their textual representations (e.g., IUPAC). This paper introduces BioT5+, an extension of the BioT5 framework, tailored to enhance biological research and drug discovery. BioT5+ incorporates several novel features: integration of IUPAC names for molecular understanding, inclusion of extensive bio-text and molecule data from sources like bioRxiv and PubChem, the multi-task instruction tuning for generality across tasks, and a numerical tokenization technique for improved processing of numerical data. These enhancements allow BioT5+ to bridge the gap between molecular representations and their textual descriptions, providing a more holistic understanding of biological entities, and largely improving the grounded reasoning of bio-text and bio-sequences. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned with a large number of experiments, including \\emph{3 types of problems (classification, regression, generation), 15 kinds of tasks, and 21 total benchmark datasets}, demonstrating the remarkable performance and state-of-the-art results in most cases.

Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 9.

Many variants of pre-trained Transformers have kept breaking out, and most focus on designing different pre-training objectives or variants of self-attention. Embedding the position information in the self-attention mechanism is also an indispensable factor in Transformers however is often discussed at will. Therefore, this paper carries out an empirical study on position embeddings of mainstream pre-trained Transformers, which mainly focuses on two questions: 1) Do position embeddings really learn the meaning of positions? 2) How do these different learned position embeddings affect Transformers for NLP tasks? This paper focuses on providing a new insight of pre-trained position embeddings through feature-level analysis and empirical experiments on most of iconic NLP tasks.

Surprisingly, however, there is still no clear understanding of the relation between these two augmentation schemes. Here we propose a novel family of positional encoding schemes which draws a link between the above two approaches and improves over both. The new approach, named Random Feature Propagation (RFP), is inspired by the power iteration method and its generalizations. It concatenates several intermediate steps of an iterative algorithm for computing the dominant eigenvectors of a propagation matrix, starting from random node features. Notably, these propagation steps are based on graph-dependent propagation operators that can be either predefined or learned. We explore the theoretical and empirical benefits of RFP. First, we provide theoretical justifications for using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps, and for using multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that RFP significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple node classification and graph classification benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 11 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

One of the most popular types of encoding used\ntoday in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries\nand keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is\nuseful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance\nincreases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason.\nWe study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is\nbeing used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to\nconstruct robust \"positional\" attention patterns by exploiting the highest\nfrequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the\nlowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic\ninformation. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct\nexperiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes\nsome highlighted issues and improves performance.

ROPE: Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding for Graph-based\n  Document Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Scaling Laws of RoPE\"*\n\n*Chen-Yu Lee, Chun-Liang Li, Chu Wang, Renshen Wang, Yasuhisa Fujii, Siyang Qin, Ashok Popat, Tomas Pfister*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural reading orders of words are crucial for information extraction from\nform-like documents. Despite recent advances in Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCNs) on modeling spatial layout patterns of documents, they have limited\nability to capture reading orders of given word-level node representations in a\ngraph. We propose Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding (ROPE), a new\npositional encoding technique designed to apprehend the sequential presentation\nof words in documents. ROPE generates unique reading order codes for\nneighboring words relative to the target word given a word-level graph\nconnectivity. We study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks\nincluding word labeling and word grouping on the public FUNSD dataset and a\nlarge-scale payment dataset. We show that ROPE consistently improves existing\nGCNs with a margin up to 8.4% F1-score.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-21T00:48:04Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-21T00:48:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"YaRN method implementation\"*\n\n*Bowen Peng, Jeffrey Quesnelle, Honglu Fan, Enrico Shippole*\n\n**Abstract:** Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode\npositional information in transformer-based language models. However, these\nmodels fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We\npresent YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to\nextend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x\nless training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA\nmodels can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer\nthan their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous\nthe state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate\nthat YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of\na fine-tuning dataset.

SeerAttention: Learning Intrinsic Sparse Attention in Your LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"YaRN method implementation\"*\n\n*Yizhao Gao, Zhichen Zeng, Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Hayden Kwok-Hay So, Ting Cao, Fan Yang, Mao Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is the cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet its\nquadratic complexity limits the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, especially\nfor those with a long-context window. A promising approach addressing this\nlimitation is to leverage the sparsity in attention. However, existing\nsparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or\nheuristics to approximate sparsity. This practice falls short to fully capture\nthe dynamic nature of attention sparsity in language-based tasks. This paper\nargues that attention sparsity should be learned rather than predefined. To\nthis end, we design SeerAttention, a new Attention mechanism that augments the\nconventional attention with a learnable gate that adaptively selects\nsignificant blocks in an attention map and deems the rest blocks sparse. Such\nblock-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speedup. To enable\nefficient learning of the gating network, we develop a customized\nFlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth of\nattention map with minimum overhead. SeerAttention not only applies to\npost-training, but also excels in long-context fine-tuning. Our results show\nthat at post-training stages, SeerAttention significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods, while also\nbeing more versatile and flexible to adapt to varying context lengths and\nsparsity ratios. When applied to long-context fine-tuning with YaRN,\nSeerAttention can achieve a remarkable 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context\nlength with minimal perplexity loss, offering a 5.67x speedup over\nFlashAttention-2.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17T07:07:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-18T05:01:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Mixture of In-Context Experts Enhance LLMs' Long Context Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE integration challenges\"*\n\n*Hongzhan Lin, Ang Lv, Yuhan Chen, Chen Zhu, Yang Song, Hengshu Zhu, Rui Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** Many studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) exhibit uneven\nawareness of different contextual positions. Their limited context awareness\ncan lead to overlooking critical information and subsequent task failures.\nWhile several approaches have been proposed to enhance LLMs' context awareness,\nachieving both effectiveness and efficiency remains challenging. In this paper,\nfor LLMs utilizing RoPE as position embeddings, we introduce a novel method\ncalled \"Mixture of In-Context Experts\" (MoICE) to address this challenge. MoICE\ncomprises two key components: a router integrated into each attention head\nwithin LLMs and a lightweight router-only training optimization strategy: (1)\nMoICE views each RoPE angle as an `in-context' expert, demonstrated to be\ncapable of directing the attention of a head to specific contextual positions.\nConsequently, each attention head flexibly processes tokens using multiple RoPE\nangles dynamically selected by the router to attend to the needed positions.\nThis approach mitigates the risk of overlooking essential contextual\ninformation. (2) The router-only training strategy entails freezing LLM\nparameters and exclusively updating routers for only a few steps. When applied\nto open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral, MoICE surpasses prior methods\nacross multiple tasks on long context understanding and generation, all while\nmaintaining commendable inference efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-28T01:46:41Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-17T03:53:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7. Found in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts Better via\n  Plug-and-Play Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE integration challenges\"*\n\n*Zhenyu Zhang, Runjin Chen, Shiwei Liu, Zhewei Yao, Olatunji Ruwase, Beidi Chen, Xiaoxia Wu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper aims to overcome the \"lost-in-the-middle\" challenge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). While recent advancements have successfully enabled\nLLMs to perform stable language modeling with up to 4 million tokens, the\npersistent difficulty faced by most LLMs in identifying relevant information\nsituated in the middle of the context has not been adequately tackled. To\naddress this problem, this paper introduces Multi-scale Positional Encoding\n(Ms-PoE) which is a simple yet effective plug-and-play approach to enhance the\ncapacity of LLMs to handle the relevant information located in the middle of\nthe context, without fine-tuning or introducing any additional overhead. Ms-PoE\nleverages the position indice rescaling to relieve the long-term decay effect\nintroduced by RoPE, while meticulously assigning distinct scaling ratios to\ndifferent attention heads to preserve essential knowledge learned during the\npre-training step, forming a multi-scale context fusion from short to long\ndistance. Extensive experiments with a wide range of LLMs demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach. Notably, Ms-PoE achieves an average accuracy gain of\nup to 3.8 on the Zero-SCROLLS benchmark over the original LLMs. Code are\navailable at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Ms-PoE.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-05T04:58:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-05T04:58:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 8.

Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"RetNet MultiScaleRetention enhancement\"*\n\n*Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Shuming Ma, Yuqing Xia, Jilong Xue, Jianyong Wang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation\narchitecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training\nparallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive\nthe connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention\nmechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms,\ni.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel\nrepresentation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation\nenables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency,\nand GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent\nrepresentation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear\ncomplexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently\nsummarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that\nRetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost\ndeployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a\nstrong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Which Encoding is the Best for Text Classification in Chinese, English,\n  Japanese and Korean?\n\n*From Search Query: \"Positional encoding empirical comparisons\"*\n\n*Xiang Zhang, Yann LeCun*\n\n**Abstract:** This article offers an empirical study on the different ways of encoding\nChinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK) and English languages for text classification.\nDifferent encoding levels are studied, including UTF-8 bytes, characters,\nwords, romanized characters and romanized words. For all encoding levels,\nwhenever applicable, we provide comparisons with linear models, fastText and\nconvolutional networks. For convolutional networks, we compare between encoding\nmechanisms using character glyph images, one-hot (or one-of-n) encoding, and\nembedding. In total there are 473 models, using 14 large-scale text\nclassification datasets in 4 languages including Chinese, English, Japanese and\nKorean. Some conclusions from these results include that byte-level one-hot\nencoding based on UTF-8 consistently produces competitive results for\nconvolutional networks, that word-level n-grams linear models are competitive\neven without perfect word segmentation, and that fastText provides the best\nresult using character-level n-gram encoding but can overfit when the features\nare overly rich.\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-08T21:24:44Z  (*Updated: 2017-08-17T00:34:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 11. Fair NLP Models with Differentially Private Text Encoders\n\n*From Search Query: \"Positional encoding empirical comparisons\"*\n\n*Gaurav Maheshwari, Pascal Denis, Mikaela Keller, Aur\u00e9lien Bellet*\n\n**Abstract:** Encoded text representations often capture sensitive attributes about\nindividuals (e.g., race or gender), which raise privacy concerns and can make\ndownstream models unfair to certain groups. In this work, we propose FEDERATE,\nan approach that combines ideas from differential privacy and adversarial\ntraining to learn private text representations which also induces fairer\nmodels. We empirically evaluate the trade-off between the privacy of the\nrepresentations and the fairness and accuracy of the downstream model on four\nNLP datasets. Our results show that FEDERATE consistently improves upon\nprevious methods, and thus suggest that privacy and fairness can positively\nreinforce each other.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-12T14:58:38Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-12T14:58:38Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Scaling Laws of RoPE\"*\n\n*Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu, Chenxin An, Shuo Zhang, Hang Yan, Xiaoran Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The extrapolation capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Rotary Position Embedding is currently a topic of considerable interest. The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at Any Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"Scaling Laws of RoPE\"*\n\n*Junyang Lin, Jingren Zhou, Chang Zhou, Dayiheng Liu, Rui Men, Xuancheng Ren, Mengfei Du, Kai Dang, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Jialin Wang, Xuejing Liu, Keqin Chen, Jinze Bai, Zhihao Fan, Shijie Wang, Sinan Tan, Shuai Bai, Peng Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

Fast Linking Numbers for Topology Verification of Loopy Structures\n\n*From Search Query: \"YaRN method implementation\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** It is increasingly common to model, simulate, and process complex materials based on loopy structures, such as in yarn-level cloth garments, which possess topological constraints between inter-looping curves. While the input model may satisfy specific topological linkages between pairs of closed loops, subsequent processing may violate those topological conditions. In this paper, we explore a family of methods for efficiently computing and verifying linking numbers between closed curves, and apply these to applications in geometry processing, animation, and simulation, so as to verify that topological invariants are preserved during and after processing of the input models. Our method has three stages: (1) we identify potentially interacting loop-loop pairs, then (2) carefully discretize each loop's spline curves into line segments so as to enable (3) efficient linking number evaluation using accelerated kernels based on either counting projected segment-segment crossings, or by evaluating the Gauss linking integral using direct or fast summation methods (Barnes-Hut or fast multipole methods). We evaluate CPU and GPU implementations of these methods on a suite of test problems, including yarn-level cloth and chainmail, that involve significant processing: physics-based relaxation and animation, user-modeled deformations, curve compression and reparameterization. We show that topology errors can be efficiently identified to enable more robust processing of loopy structures.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods for Real-Time Modeling of Deformable Linear Objects\n\n*From Search Query: \"RoPE integration challenges\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the task of modeling Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), such as ropes and cables, during dynamic motion over long time horizons. This task presents significant challenges due to the complex dynamics of DLOs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods For deformable linear Objects with Real-time Modeling (DEFORM), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to model DLOs accurately and in real-time. The performance of DEFORM is evaluated in an experimental setup involving two industrial robots and a variety of sensors. A comprehensive series of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of DEFORM in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability when compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. To further demonstrate the utility of DEFORM, this paper integrates it into a perception pipeline and illustrates its superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art methods while tracking a DLO even in the presence of occlusions. Finally, this paper illustrates the superior performance of DEFORM when compared to state-of-the-art methods when it is applied to perform autonomous planning and control of DLOs.

Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?\n\n*From Search Query: \"Positional encoding empirical comparisons\"*\n\n*Qiang Xu, Lei Zhang, Muxi Chen, Ailing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the \\emph{permutation-invariant} self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.

RCMHA: Relative Convolutional Multi-Head Attention for Natural Language Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Positional encoding empirical comparisons\"*\n\n*Husni Mubarok, Aradea, Herman Sugiharto*\n\n**Abstract:** The Attention module finds common usage in language modeling, presenting distinct challenges within the broader scope of Natural Language Processing. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) employs an absolute positional encoding, which imposes limitations on token length and entails substantial memory consumption during the processing of embedded inputs. The current remedy proposed by researchers involves the utilization of relative positional encoding, similar to the approach adopted in Transformer-XL or Relative Multi-Head Attention (RMHA), albeit the employed architecture consumes considerable memory resources. To address these challenges, this study endeavors to refine MHA, leveraging relative positional encoding in conjunction with the Depth-Wise Convolutional Layer architecture, which promises heightened accuracy coupled with minimized memory usage. The proposed RCMHA framework entails the modification of two integral components: firstly, the application of the Depth-Wise Convolutional Layer to the input embedding, encompassing Query, Key, and Value parameters; secondly, the incorporation of Relative Positional Encoding into the attention scoring phase, harmoniously integrated with Scaled Dot-Product Attention. Empirical experiments underscore the advantages of RCMHA, wherein it exhibits superior accuracy, boasting a score of 0.572 in comparison to alternative attention modules such as MHA, Multi-DConv-Head Attention (MDHA), and RMHA. Concerning memory utilization, RMHA emerges as the most frugal, demonstrating an average consumption of 2.98 GB, surpassing RMHA which necessitates 3.5 GB.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate advanced positional encoding methods like **Resonance RoPE**, **Scaling Laws of RoPE**, and **YaRN** into the **MultiScaleRetention** unit of RetNet, here are the most relevant and useful insights from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Resonance RoPE Integration\n\n- **Resonance RoPE** is designed to refine the interpolation of RoPE features for out-of-distribution positions, which can improve context length generalization without additional online computational costs.

It involves adjusting the RoPE scaling by introducing position interpolation and adjusted scaling factors. YaRN has been shown to effectively extend the context window up to 128K tokens.\n\n## Practical Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n- **Integration Challenges:**\n  - Integrating these advanced positional encodings requires careful adjustment of the RoPE base value and possibly fine-tuning with extended context lengths. For example, smaller base values can facilitate extrapolation by allowing more dimensions to complete a full period within the training context length.\n  - Implementing YaRN involves adjusting the scaling factors and may require modifications to the attention mechanism to ensure compatibility with the existing model architecture.\n\n- **Empirical Results:**\n  - Models integrating Scaling Laws of RoPE or YaRN have demonstrated significant improvements in context length generalization. Fine-tuning with adjusted base values and context lengths is crucial for achieving these results.\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\n- **Functional Interpolation with FIRE:**\n  - FIRE uses a learnable function with progressive interpolation to map input positions to biases, which can represent popular positional encodings and shows improved length generalization. This method does not rely on specific base values and can be an alternative or complementary approach.\n\n- **LM-Infinite:**\n  - LM-Infinite enhances LLMs' capabilities of handling long contexts without parameter updates, using a \u039b-shaped attention mask and a ceiling on attention distances. This method can be used in conjunction with other positional encoding techniques to further improve generalization.\n\n## Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics\n\n- **Benchmarks:**\n  - Benchmarks like **L-Eval**, **SCROLLS**, and datasets like **Books3** and **C4** are used to evaluate the extrapolation capabilities of models. These benchmarks help in assessing the performance of the integrated methods.\n\n- **Evaluation Metrics:**\n  - Key metrics include perplexity on validation datasets and performance on downstream tasks like QA and summarization. These metrics will help in evaluating the success of the modifications made to the **MultiScaleRetention** unit.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Understanding the Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation\n\n- The critical dimension for extrapolation is a key concept, determined by the base value and the training context length. Adjusting this base value can significantly enhance the model's ability to generalize to longer contexts.\n\n### Implementing YaRN in RetNet's MultiScaleRetention\n\n- YaRN modifies the RoPE scaling by introducing position interpolation and adjusted scaling factors. This method requires significantly less data and training steps to extend the context window effectively. Fine-tuning the model on a small amount of data with extended context lengths is necessary.\n\n### Applying Resonance RoPE\n\n- Resonance RoPE improves context length generalization by refining the interpolation of RoPE features. It does not introduce additional online computational costs but may require adjustments to the model to handle the modified positional embeddings without affecting performance on shorter sequences.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\nTo further support the researcher, the following search plan can be implemented:\n\n### Keywords\n```keywords\n\"RoPE integration challenges\", \"RetNet MultiScaleRetention enhancement\", \"Positional encoding empirical comparisons\", \"YaRN implementation details\", \"Resonance RoPE practical implementation\"\n```\n\n### Description\n```description\nLooking for detailed implementation guides, empirical results, and practical challenges associated with integrating advanced positional encoding methods like Resonance RoPE, Scaling Laws of RoPE, and YaRN into models similar to RetNet's MultiScaleRetention unit.

However, the accuracy of these models usually drops quickly for inputs longer than the ones used during training (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Deletang et al., 2023) - which are usually relatively short (e.g. 2048 for LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b)) to avoid the expensive quadratic attention cost during training. This has led to a significant interest in improving length generalization of Transformers - where we train the model using shorter inputs (e.g. 2048) and test the models performance on longer inputs (e.g. 8192) (Press et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Chowdhury \\& Caragea, 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Transformers are fundamentally permutation equivariant, and are agnostic to input sequence ordering (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yun et al., 2019) ${ }^{1}$. They rely on position encodings to learn the ordering of input tokens. Popular position encodings such as Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) (Vaswani et al., 2017) and more recent Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021) do not generalize to longer contexts than seen during training (Kazemnejad et al., 2023). T5's relative positional encoding (Raffel et al., 2019) generalizes to longer contexts by using the same representation for all out of distribution (OOD) sequence lengths, but suffers from slow vector operations on modern accelerators (Press et al., 2022). Another line of recent work promotes length generalization by encoding specific inductive biases on how attention should decay with sequence length (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023). More recently, Kazemnejad et al. (2023) show that having no position encodings in decoder-only models can have better length generalization, albeit for small-scale synthetic tasks. In this work we take a functional approach to learn the relative position biases ${ }^{2}$, instead of having hard coded inductive biases, towards training language models with length generalization (focusing on decoder-only models). We propose FIRE (Functional Interpolation for $\\underline{R}$ elative Positional $\\underline{E n c o d i n g}$ ) method that i) uses a learnable function to map the input positions to biases, and ii) uses a progressive\n\n[^0]interpolation technique, which ensures bounded input for the position encoding function for all input sequence lengths, thereby enabling length generalization. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d088fcacf966257ed8c9g-02.jpg?height=410&width=489&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=1254)\n\nFigure 1: Language modeling perplexity on C4 with varying evaluation sequence lengths. Models are trained on length 2048. A functional approach to learn the biases allows the model to adapt to the given task instead of always having the same inductive bias, e.g. bias towards nearby tokens as in (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023). In particular we use an MLP to learn these biases, which we theoretically prove can represent several popular methods such as T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple in a parameter efficient manner. In fact, all our experiments use a tiny MLP with a hidden size of 32 , which is also accelerator-friendly unlike T5's RPE. Next, our progressive interpolation technique normalizes the query-key relative distance by the query position. Since for causal attention in language models the relative distance is always between 0 and the query position, progressive interpolation results in an output that is always bounded between $[0,1]$. This results in\nput sequence lengths, leading to better generalization performance. As a result, with increasingly longer sequence lengths, the positional inputs will form progressively finer grids, interpolating the positional encoding function on $[0,1]$. Inspired by the existing methods, we incorporate the following two transformations into FIRE, which we find helpful to improve the model quality. i) To encourage locality bias in FIRE, we apply the popular log transformation (Raffel et al., 2019; Chi et al., 2022) to the relative distance before feeding it to the MLP, which amplifies the input differences for local tokens. ii) Next we modify progressive interpolation with a learnable threshold in the normalizer to yield exact distances for shorter contexts. Note that both these transformations do not limit the ability of the model to learn arbitrary biases. In fact we show that FIRE learns to pay more attention to far away contexts in some attention heads. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the effectiveness of FIRE for length generalization. We benchmark FIRE as well as other positional encoding approaches on a wide range of real-world language modeling ( C 4 , arXiv, and Github), long text benchmark (SCROLLS), zero-shot long-context question answering (NarrativeQA), and natural language understanding benchmarks (GLUE/SuperGLUE). Our empirical results show the strong length generalization performance and long text modeling capability of FIRE. Our experiments on standard natural language understanding benchmarks show that FIRE is competitive on short sequence tasks as well. We further visualize the learned positional encoding of FIRE showing that it learns diverse patterns, beyond just locality bias. The main contributions of our paper are summarized below:\n\n- We propose FIRE, a new functional relative positional encoding method. Using progressive interpolation, FIRE is able to transform arbitrary input lengths into bounded domain, followed by a learned mapping. - We theoretically prove that FIRE can represent popular position encodings such as T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple, thereby unifying a class of existing position encoding approaches. - We empirically show strong length generalization behavior of FIRE, significantly improving over existing methods in zero-shot and finetuning settings on a wide range of datasets and benchmarks. For instance, it consistently delivers strongest performance on C 4 language modeling across various sequence lengths, outperforming the best baseline by 2.28 perplexity points (Fig. 1). On SCROLLS long text benchmark, FIRE surpasses all the competing methods on average by over 1 point (Table 1). - We present visualization of learned position embeddings of FIRE model showing that it can learn both local and anti-local position biases. ## 2 PoSITIONAL ENCODINGS AND LENGTH GENERALIZATION\n\nWe are interested in building Transformer models with length generalization ability, i.e., we expect that the model can be trained on sequences of length $L_{\\text {train }}$ and be directly applied to sequence length $L_{\\text {test }}$ without performance degradation for $L_{\\text {test }}>L_{\\text {train }}$ (Press et al., 2022). Length generalization requires Transformers to generalize to unseen positions during training, and designing better position\nencodings is an active line of research towards improving the length generalization (Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Kazemnejad et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). In this section, we review existing positional encoding approaches with an emphasis on their length generalization abilities. More discussions on related work can be found in Appendix D. ### 2.1 Absolute Positional EnCoding\n\nThe Transformer paper (Vaswani et al., 2017) proposes Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) to endow Transformers with positional information. In particular, a (learnable or fixed sinusoidal) real-valued embedding $e_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is assigned to each position $i$, leading to an Absolute Positional Encoding matrix $\\boldsymbol{E}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{e}_{n}\\right]^{\\top}$, which will be added to the input sequence. Though simple and straightforward, APE-based Transformers usually generalize poorly to longer sequences (Press et al., 2022). ### 2.2 Relative Positional Encoding\n\nRelative Positional Encoding (RPE) is an increasingly popular way to encode positional information for Transformers. Shaw et al. (2018) are the first to introduce RPE to Transformers and their proposed method adds position encodings to the key (and optionally the value) in the attention layer, instead of the input. Raffel et al. (2019) simplify the vector representations of relative positions to scalars and use them as a bias term added to the pre-softmax attention logits. They further map any OOD sequence lengths to the same position, resulting in length generalization. This form of additive RPE has proven to be highly effective in many applications (Dai et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021). Following this, multiple additive RPE methods have been proposed to improve both length generalization and efficiency, such as Alibi (Press et al., 2022), Kerple (Chi et al., 2022), and Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023). Additive RPE. For most of these additive RPE methods, the computation of the (pre-softmax) attention logits can be unified using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{* 2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Let the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ be $b(i, j)$. Different formulations and parameterizations of $b$ lead to different RPE variants. A few examples that support arbitary sequence length include:\n\n- T5's RPE (Raffel et al., 2019): $b(i, j)=r_{\\min \\{i-j, K\\}}$, where $K$ is a hyper-parameter and $\\left\\{r_{i}\\right\\}_{i=0}^{K}$ are learnable scalars. ${ }^{3}$\n- Alibi (Press et al., 2022): $b(i, j)=-r|i-j|$, where $r>0$ is a hyper-parameter. - Kerple (Chi et al., 2022): $b(i, j)=-r_{1} \\log \\left(1+r_{2}|i-j|\\right)$ (logarithmic variant) or $-r_{1}|i-j|^{r_{2}}$ (power variant), where $r_{1}, r_{2}>0$ are learnable scalars. - Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023): $b(i, j)=r_{1} \\sum_{k=1}^{r_{2}} \\cos \\left((i-j) / 10000 \\frac{k}{d^{\\prime}}\\right)$, where $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are hyper-parameters. The above methods can be applied to longer sequences than training, but they also have several limitations. T5's RPE uses the same attention bias for all query-key pairs with distance greater than $K$, lacking representational power to distinguish between different positions in long sequences. Furthermore, it relies on vector operations that are not accelerator-friendly, making its training and inference relatively slow (Press et al., 2022). Alibi, Kerple, and Sandwich significantly bias towards local attention, making it harder to attend to more distant query-key pairs (Chi et al., 2023). This property can prevent the model from capturing long-range dependencies and lead to performance degradation on some tasks. In the subsequent section, we will present our method to overcome these limitations. Rotary Positional Encoding. In addition to the aforementioned methods, there are also several non-additive RPE variants. Among them, the most popular one in large language models is Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a). RoPE\n\n[^1]rotates the query and key vectors with an angle proportional to their absolute positions before the dot product attention, which results in attention being a function of the relative distance between the tokens, capturing the relative positional information.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In performing the NLP tasks, the maximal length of the sequences (the context window) determined by its training processes has been one of the major limits of a pretrained LLM. Being able to dynamically extend the context window via a small amount of fine-tuning (or without fine-tuning) has become more and more desirable. To this end, the position encodings of transformers are the center of the discussions. The original Transformer architecture used an absolute sinusoidal position encoding, which was later improved to a learnable absolute position encoding [15]. Since then, relative positional encoding schemes [32] have further increased the performance of Transformers. Currently, the most popular relative positional encodings are T5 Relative Bias [30], RoPE [34], XPos [35], and ALiBi [27]. One reoccurring limitation with positional encodings is the inability to generalize past the context window seen during training. While some methods such as ALiBi are able to do limited generalization, none are able to generalize to sequences significantly longer than their pre-trained length [22]. Some works have been done to overcome such limitation. [9] and concurrently [21] proposed to extend the context length by slightly modifying RoPE via Position Interpolation (PI) and fine-tuning on a small amount of data. As an alternative, [6] proposed the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation by taking the loss of high frequency into account. Since then, two improvements of the \"NTK-aware\" interpolation have been proposed, with different emphasis:\n\n- the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation method [14] for pre-trained models without fine-tuning. - the \"NTK-by-parts\" interpolation method [7] which performs the best when fine-tuned on a small amount of longer-context data. The \"NTK-aware\" interpolation and the \"Dynamic NTK\" interpolation have already seen their presence in the open-source models such as Code Llama [31] (using \"NTK-aware\" interpolation) and Qwen 7B [2] (using \"Dynamic NTK\"). In this paper, in addition to making a complete account of the previous unpublished works on the \"NTK-aware\", the \"Dynamic NTK\" and the \"NTK-by-part\" interpolations, we present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), an improved method to efficiently extend the context window of models trained with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) including the LLaMA [38], the GPTNeoX [5], and the PaLM [10] families of models. YaRN reaches state-of-the-art performances in context window extensions after fine-tuning on less than $\\sim 0.1 \\%$ of the original pre-training data. In the meantime, by combining with the inference-time technique called Dynamic Scaling, the Dynamic-YaRN allows for more than 2x context window extension without any fine-tuning. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Rotary Position Embeddings\n\nThe basis of our work is the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduced in [34]. We work on a hidden layer where the set of hidden neurons are denoted by $D$. Given a sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}$, following the notation of [34], the attention layer first converts the vectors into the query vectors and the key vectors:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{m}=f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}=f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|D|}\n$$\n\nNext, the attention weights are calculated as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}}{\\sqrt{|D|}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_{m}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ are considered as column vectors so that $\\mathbf{q}_{m}^{T} \\mathbf{k}_{n}$ is simply the Euclidean inner product. In RoPE, we first assume that $|D|$ is even and identify the embedding space and the hidden states as\ncomplex vector spaces:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{|D|} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{|D| / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere the inner product $\\mathbf{q}^{T} \\mathbf{k}$ becomes the real part of the standard Hermitian inner product $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\mathbf{k}\\right)$.

This way, RoPE associates each (complex-valued) hidden neuron with a separate frequency $\\theta_{d}$. The benefit of doing so is that the dot product between the query vector and the key vector only depends on the relative distance $m-n$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}} \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle f_{q}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m\\right), f_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}, n\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{q}^{*} \\mathbf{W}_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{n} e^{i \\theta(m-n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & g\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbf{x}_{n}, m-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn real coordinates, the RoPE can be written using the following function\n$f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\\cos m \\theta_{1} & -\\sin m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sin m \\theta_{1} & \\cos m \\theta_{1} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & -\\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin m \\theta_{2} & \\cos m \\theta_{2} & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\cos m \\theta_{l} & -\\sin m \\theta_{l} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\sin m \\theta_{l} & \\cos m \\theta_{l}\\end{array}\\right) \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{m}$\nso that\n\n$$\nf_{q}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{q}}, f_{k}=f_{\\mathbf{W}_{k}}\n$$\n\n### 2.2 Position Interpolation\n\nAs language models are usually pre-trained with a fixed context length, it is natural to ask how to extend the context length by fine-tuning on relatively less amount of data. For language models using RoPE as the position embedding, Chen et al. [9], and concurrently kaiokendev [21] proposed the Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context length beyond the pre-trained limit. While a direct extrapolation does not perform well on sequences $w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{L}$ with $L$ larger than the pre-trained limit, they discovered that interpolating the position indicies within the pre-trained limit works well with the help of a small amount of fine-tuning. Specifically, given a pre-trained language model with RoPE, they modify the RoPE by\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\frac{m L}{L^{\\prime}}, \\theta_{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L^{\\prime}>L$ is a new context window beyond the pre-trained limit. With the original pre-trained model plus the modified RoPE formula, they fine-tuned the language model further on several orders of magnitude fewer tokens (a few billion in Chen et al. [9]) and successfully acheived context window extension. ### 2.3 Additional Notation\n\nThe ratio between the extended context length and the original context length has been of special importance, and we introduce the notation $s$ defined by\n\n$$\ns=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{L}\n$$\n\nand we call $s$ the scale factor. We also rewrite and simplify Eq. 10 into the following general form:\n\n$$\nf_{\\mathbf{W}}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, m, \\theta_{d}\\right)=f_{\\mathbf{W}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{m}, g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $g(m), h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$ are method-dependent functions. For PI, we have $g(m)=m / s, h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)=\\theta_{d}$. In the subsequent sections, when we introduce a new interpolation method, we sometimes only specify the functions $g(m)$ and $h\\left(\\theta_{d}\\right)$. Additionally, we define $\\lambda_{d}$ as the wavelength of the RoPE embedding at $d$-th hidden dimension:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{d}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\theta_{d}}=2 \\pi b^{\\frac{2 d}{|D|}}\n$$\n\nThe wavelength describes the length of tokens needed in order for the RoPE embedding at dimension $d$ to perform a full rotation $(2 \\pi)$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation (Avg.

For each position, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding. The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute positional encoding. The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative positional encoding. Theoretical analysis shows this disentanglement of positional information makes learning more effective. The empirical results also show that our BiPE has superior length extrapolation capabilities across a wide range of tasks in diverse text modalities.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/42 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nHere we provide a literature review of existing approaches related to this problem. ### 2.1. Improved Positional Encodings for Length Extrapolation\n\nThe original Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) encodes position information via Absolute Positional Encoding (APE), where each position is equipped with a (learnable or fixed sinusoidal) real-valued embedding. But neither the learnable nor the fixed sinusoidal embedding can generalize well to longer sequences. Different from APE that assigns an embedding for each position $i$, Shaw et al. (2018) introduced Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) which encodes the relative distance $i-j$ for each position pair $(i, j)$. Most methods incorporate RPE as an additive term in the attention module (Raffel et al., 2020; Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023). These methods can mitigate the length extrapolation problem to some extent but still have several limitations. For example, Raffel et al. (2020) uses the same attention bias for all query-key pairs with a relative distance larger than $K$, which limits its ability to distinguish different positions in long sequences. One of the most popularly used relative positional encoding in recent large language models is Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). RoPE rotates the query and key vectors with an angle proportional to their absolute positions before the attention, which results in the attention being a function of the relative distance between tokens. While encoder-only Transformers (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b)) are permutation equivariant without positional encoding, Haviv et al. (2022) show that decoder-only Transformers with causal attention masks can learn positional information even without any explicit positional encoding. Recently, Kazemnejad et al. (2023) discovered that the no positional encoding (NoPE) model also can handle longer sequences to some extent on small-scale synthetic tasks, but there is no strongly positive evidence on large-scale settings. ### 2.2. Improved Algorithms for Length Extrapolation\n\nTo help positional encodings handle longer sequences, Ruoss et al. (2023b) recently proposed a way to randomly select a subset of positions from a much larger range than those observed during training. The positional information of longer sequences can thus be simulated. Zhu et al. (2023) proposed a similar idea called positional skip-wise fine-tuning (PoSE), which requires additional efforts for fine-tuning large-scale models. Relative positional encoding, especially RoPE, can capture the relative positional information well, but its length extrapolation capability is not satisfactory yet. Due to this, one line of works introduces priors biased toward local window attention via additive RPEs (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022; 2023; Sun et al., 2023) or hard constraints (Ratner et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023) to boost length extrapolation capabilities. Another line of works tailored to RoPE called positional embedding scaling (Chen et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023) adjusts the range of either the position index or the frequency basis in RoPE, achieving promising extrapolation performance. Recently, a concurrent work (Jin et al., 2024) proposed a bilevel attention mechanism for better length extrapolation of RoPE-based language models. It keeps the exact attention computation within a pre-defined neighbor range and uses the floor operation to group and map unseen large relative positions. BiPE aims to develop a new positional encoding scheme, which is orthogonal to all the methods above. All these advancements can be seamlessly combined with BiPE for better length extrapolation. Our experiments (Section 4) on several representative algorithms provide strong evidence supporting the compatibility of BiPE. ## 3. Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce BiPE (Bilevel Positional Encoding), a new positional encoding scheme for better length extrapolation capabilities. First, we formally describe the modular segments of text sequence in Section 3.1. Based on this segment representation, we thoroughly illustrate the derivation of our BiPE method in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, we conduct a theoretical study on the expressiveness of our BiPE to further demonstrate its soundness. ### 3.1. Modular Segments of Text Sequence\n\nFormally, we use $\\mathbf{S}=\\left[w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{l}, \\ldots, w_{L}\\right]$ to denote the input text sequence, i.e., an ordered collection of text tokens where $w_{l}$ denotes the $l$-th token and $L$ denotes the total sequence length. As previously introduced, text sequences can be decomposed into a series of non-overlapping modular segments, i.e., $\\mathbf{S}=S_{1} \\oplus S_{2} \\oplus \\ldots S_{n} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus S_{N}$ where $S_{n}$ is the $n$-th segment, $N$ is the total number of segments, and $\\oplus$ is the concatenation operation. Each segment $S_{n}$ is defined by $S_{n}=\\left[w_{a_{n}}, w_{a_{n}+1}, \\ldots, w_{b_{n}}\\right]$. Here, $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ denote the starting and ending indices. The segmentation strategy can simply use symbol detection (e.g., newline and full stop). ### 3.2. Bilevel Positional Encoding\n\nAs stated in the introduction, in many practical scenarios, the number of tokens in each segment $S_{n}$ follows a similar distribution regardless of the value $L$, and the sequence length $L$ has a major impact on the segment number $N$. Consequently, we believe modeling the length extrapolation for $N$ is a more effective approach than that for actual length $L$. To this end, we propose BiPE, a novel bilevel positional encoding that blends two distinct encoding schemes at each position for better length extrapolation: an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding. (See Figure 2). Intra-Segment Encoding. In a text sequence, each modular segment describes an independent statement, and the intra-segment positional encoding serves as an anchor to identify the location of each token in the segment for capturing semantic information therein. Formally, within each segment $S_{n}=\\left[w_{a_{n}}, w_{a_{n}+1}, \\ldots, w_{b_{n}}\\right]$, we encode the (local) position $i$ for token $w_{a_{n}+i}$, where $1 \\leq i \\leq b_{n}-a_{n}+1$. Note that the number of tokens within a segment is usually bounded, i.e., there are few sentences that are extremely long. We find using the original absolute positional encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017) is enough. For each token $w_{a_{n}+i}$ in $S_{n}$, we assign a real-valued embedding $e_{i}$ to it, which will be added to the input token embedding. $e_{i}$ is shared among tokens at the same local position $i$ in different $S_{n}$. Inter-Segment Encoding. Though the intra-segment encoding can provide the location of tokens within each segment, the locations across segments are mixed, and the contextual relationships between segments are not captured. As a complement, we use the inter-segment positional encoding to specify the segment to which each token belongs. Keeping in mind that this encoding will play another role in handling longer sequences that are unseen during training, we employ relative positional encodings (Shaw et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Press et al., 2022). Different from previous RPEs that are defined using the distance between token indexes, the inter-segment encoding is defined using\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9b94b3803fb420366468g-04.jpg?height=390&width=1691&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 2. Left: The schematic comparison of Standard Positional Encoding (top) and our proposed Bilevel Positional Encoding (BiPE, bottom). BiPE differentiates positions using both intra-segment and inter-segment encodings. Right: Absolute positional encoding is used as Intra-Segment Encoding added to the input embedding and relative positional encoding (e.g., RoPE and ALiBi) is used as Inter-Segment Encoding in the Transformer attention module. the distance between segment indexes. Instantiation. BiPE uses absolute positional information for the intra-segment encoding and can leverage any RPE approaches for the inter-segment encoding. In this work, we instantiate two BiPE variants, BiPE-RoPE and BiPE-ALiBi. BiPE-RoPE leverages RoPE (Su et al., 2021) as the intersegment encoding. For a pair of tokens $\\left(w_{l_{1}}, w_{l_{2}}\\right)$ which are in the $n$-th segment and the $m$-th segment respectively, two rotation matrices $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}$ are assigned, where $\\Theta$ denotes the pre-defined parameters of the rotation matrix (Su et al., 2021). Given query-key pair $q_{l_{1}}, k_{l_{2}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the attention score is computed by $\\frac{q_{l_{1}} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n}\\left(k_{l_{2}} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, m}\\right)^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}=$ $\\frac{q_{l_{1}} \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\Theta, n-m} k_{l_{2}}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}$. BiPE-ALiBi uses ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) as the inter-segment encoding. Similarly, the relative segment distance $n-m$ is calculated for token pair $\\left(w_{l_{1}}, w_{l_{2}}\\right)$. The attention score between the two tokens is computed by $\\frac{q_{l_{1}} k_{l_{2}}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}+r|n-m|$, where $r$ is a pre-defined hyper-parameter. Discussion. The original BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a) also includes two encodings for representing positions, but its approach differs significantly from BiPE. Primarily, BERT only needs to specify two segments using absolute encoding, tailored for the next sentence prediction task not for length extrapolation. Furthermore, BERT treats a sequence as a flat array of tokens and defines the segments in an arbitrary way, ignoring intrinsic segmentation of language data.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Even with the help of memory-efficient attention (Rabe and Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022), the maximum supported input length of current open-source pretrained Transformer language models are capped at 4,096 tokens (Touvron et al., 2023), limiting their efficacy in handling long-context tasks. One notable research topic aiming to lift the input length restriction is Length Extrapolation (Press et al., 2022). Ideally, a lengthextrapolatable Transformer language model is trained on short sequences and can perform equally\n\n[^0]| Retrieval Tasks |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Criteria | Topic |  | Line |  | Passkey |  |\n|  | 512 | 15 k | 512 | 15k | 512 | 15k |\n| $\\mathrm{P}_{\\max }$ | 0.28 | 0.12 | 0.27 | 0.11 | 0.32 | 0.24 |\n| H | 3.47 | 6.63 | 3.47 | 7.04 | 3.09 | 5.97 |\n\nTable 1: The Dispersed Attention Issue of Flan-T5-\nXL Encoder. $P_{\\text {max }}$ is the average maximum probability and H is the average entropy. After increasing the sequence length from 512 to 15 k , we observe larger entropy and smaller maximum probability, implying a flatter self-attention distribution. well on longer ones without any further fine-tuning. This is made possible with carefully designed positional embeddings (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022, 2023). Unfortunately, existing approaches are tailored for natural language modeling, a task known to have strong recency bias, and they often do not perform well on other seemingly simple tasks such as passkey, topic, and line retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Li et al., 2023). To circumvent the recency bias, we sift through the positional embeddings of existing open-source large pre-trained Transformer language models, shown in Table 2, to find a flexible design, and the T5 family (Raffel et al., 2020) comes to our attention. As visualized in Figure 1, the flexibility of T5's positional embeddings allows it to encourage recency bias on one head and discourage that on another head. However, there is no free lunch: T5 suffers from the dispersed attention issue as shown in Table 1. That is, the attention distributions of long input sequences tend to be flatter than those of short input sequences. As a remedy, we propose two fine-tuning-free attention alignment strategies via Softmax temperature scaling (Yao et al., 2021; $\\mathrm{Su}, 2021$ ) to mitigate the dispersed attention issue: maximum probability $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\max }\\right)$ and entropy $(\\mathrm{H})$ alignment. We validate the effectiveness of our alignment\n\n| Models | T5 (2020) | OPT (2022) | ChatGLM (2022) | LLaMA (2023) | Falcon (2023) | Pythia (2023) | XGen (2023) | BLOOM (2022) | MPT (2023) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| PE. | Learned | Learned | Rotary | Rotary | Rotary | Rotary | Rotary | ALiBi | ALiBi |\n|  | Relative | Absolute | Relative | Relative | Relative | Relative | Relative | Relative | Relative |\n\nTable 2: Open-source Transformer language models and their positional embeddings. T5 is the only model equipped with learnable relative positional embeddings, which enable its long-context utilization capability. strategies on tasks including language modeling, retrieval, multi-document question answering, and code completion. We also provide a theoretical analysis of how the alignment strategies work under the hood by investigating the relation between the Softmax temperature and data distribution. ## 2 Related Work\n\n## Transformer Positional Embeddings\n\nTransformer-based models rely on positional embeddings to encode positional information. We summarize open-source large pre-trained Transformer language models and their positional embeddings in Table 2. The relative variants are widely adopted due to their better empirical performance ( Su et al., 2021) and possible length-extrapolation capability (Press et al., 2022). In this work, we place special focus on the T5 positional embeddings due to their flexibility as shown in Figure 1. Transformer Length Extrapolation Existing research on Transformer length extrapolation is mostly confined to the task of natural language modeling (Press et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2022, 2023). Unfortunately, the reported positive results do not carry over to long-context retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Li et al., 2023). This contrastive observation can be explained by models' short empirical receptive field (Chi et al., 2023). In short, the strong decaying prior of positional embeddings prevents models from accessing distant tokens that may be necessary for retrieval tasks. In this work, we improve the flexible positional embeddings of T5 to get around this limitation. Transformer Position Interpolation Instead of performing direct length extrapolation, a different line of research conducts model fine-tuning on long input sequences (Chen et al., 2023), where the main focus is to identify the most efficient fine-tuning scheme that can improve long-context utilization. Positive results have been reported on retrieval tasks (Li et al., 2023). However, we argue that fine-tuning incurs additional costs since it needs\n\n1) GPU resources to perform long sequence finetuning with large models and 2) a pre-defined target sequence length, which still imposes a sequence length upper limit. Our proposed methods can circumvent these two limitations. ## Retrieval Tasks with Transformers\n\n Transformer-based approaches often consist of a retriever and a reader to overcome the context length restriction (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard and Grave, 2021; Borgeaud et al., 2022). The retriever retrieves relevant text snippets from a very large database and the reader digests the retrieved information to generate the correct output. Our proposed attention alignment strategy can be used to significantly increase the input sequence length of the reader, thereby allowing more retrieved information to participate in the decision process. For small-scale retrieval problems, our methods even obviate the need for context segmentation and the external key-value store used in prior work (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023), serving as a more elegant approach.Softmax Temperature Scaling To increase the length extrapolation capability of Transformers, previous work (Yao et al., 2021; Su, 2021) scales the temperature of Softmax logarithmically w.r.t the sequence length to ensure invariant entropy. Our entropy alignment strategy is also inspired by this line of research except that we adopt a different procedure outlined below in Algorithm 1. Interestingly, our results in $\\S 7$ show that the logarithmic temperature scaling scheme is more similar to our proposed maximum probability alignment strategy. ## 3 Long-context Retrieval Tasks with T5\n\n### 3.1 Why Retrieval? As suggested by recent work (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Li et al., 2023), the task of longcontext retrieval serves as a controllable benchmark to measure how well a Transformer language model utilizes long-context inputs. One prominent characteristic of retrieval tasks is that only a subset of the input is of interest, requiring a model to accu-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_0dede2f48b16f59a9502g-03.jpg?height=580&width=1393&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=333)\n\nFigure 1: Visualization of T5 Positional Embeddings. To plot figures of $b_{m, n}$, we set $m=7500$ and vary the value of $n$ from 0 to 15 k . Each attention head of a Flan-T5-XL encoder learns a set of positional embeddings that capture different attention bias. For example, the positional embeddings in the left figure encourage the model to focus on nearby tokens. In contrast, the ones in the right figure let the model focus on only remote tokens. rately pick up the necessary information. The other characteristic is that the key information can sit anywhere in an input, requiring a model to attend flexibly. Finally, the controllable aspect allows us to gradually increase the input sequence length to test the models' length extrapolation capability. ### 3.2 Why T5? To solve retrieval tasks using Transformer language models, it is necessary to choose a positional embedding design that permits accurate and flexible length-extrapolatable attention. After checking through the existing positional embeddings in Table 2, we find that the T5 family (Raffel et al., 2020) fits our needs. As for other candidates, learnable absolute positional embeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2022) must be evaluated within the training length. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) and Rotary (Su et al., 2021) have a recency bias; they cannot extrapolate easily without fine-tuning.

Score: 0.93)\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors is proposed, which enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/29 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nDiscussion. We can also interpret the proposed method from an alternative perspective. In the standard transformer architecture, the pre-softmax attention typically involves the key-query similarity and the positional encoding by either addition (in the form of $a+b$, e.g., Alibi and Kerple) or multiplication (in the form of $a * b$, e.g., RoPE). Here, we propose a unified approach by replacing them with\nlearnable MLPs, i.e., $\\operatorname{MLP}(a, b)$. This configuration allows the model to learn the desired relationship between the pre-softmax attention, the key-query similarity and the positional encoding. It can also be regarded as a new transformer architecture that empower the transformer with additional MLPs on pre-softmax attentions. A variant of CAPE with residual connections. It is well-known that deep neural networks may suffer from gradient vanishing. To further enhance the practical performances, we introduce the residual connection for positional information. Consequently, Equation 2 is modified as follows:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{CAPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}+f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this reformulation, $f(\\cdot)$ acts as adaptive correction term to the traditionally fixed RPE, dynamically adjusting the positional bias matrices $\\boldsymbol{B}$ based on both semantic and positional inputs. In Section 4, we empirically explore the impact of residual connections in CAPE. Our observations reveal that for well-behaved bias matrices $\\boldsymbol{B}$, the CAPE model with residual connections, as specified in Equation 3, is preferable. Conversely, if the bias matrix is underperforming but still conveys positional information, the original implementation in Equation 2 is more effective. Multi-head CAPE. In its simplest form, CAPE is considered for a single-head case as described in Equation 2 and Equation 3. However, adopting a multi-head mechanism significantly enhances model capabilities. To effectively combine both semantic and positional information, the CAPE in a multi-head setup processes the key-query similarities and bias matrices from all heads. Specifically, for an $h$-head layer, the function $f(\\cdot)$ inputs a $2 h$-dimensional concatenation of key-query similarities and positional biases. It then outputs $h$-dimensional vectors, where each element corresponds to the CAPE for the respective head. Importantly, semantic and positional information across different heads are processed simultaneously within the same MLPs, rather than sequentially. This approach not only improves computational efficiencies through parallel processing but also capitalizes on the richer semantic information available across all heads. Compared to the key-query similarity derived from a single head, the comprehensive attention from all heads yields more substantial semantic information. Computational costs analysis. Here, we evaluate the additional computational costs introduced by the CAPE method, compared with the classical positional encoding methods (e.g., Alibi and Kerple). We consider a transformer model with $h$ heads and assume a sequence length of $N$ and all hidden dimensions in the attention layer being $d$. Then the total computational cost for a standard transformer equipped with classical PEs is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(h N^{2} d+h N d^{2}\\right)$. When incorporating the proposed CAPE, which employs two-layer MLPs with hidden dimension $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$, the additional computational costs are $\\mathcal{O}\\left(h N^{2} D_{\\text {CAPE }}\\right)$. If the hidden dimensions $D_{\\text {CAPE }} \\ll d$, the incremental computational cost introduced by CAPE is not significant. ## 4 Experiment\n\nBaselines. We evaluate the proposed CAPE against a range of established baselines, including NoPE [32], RoPE [61], YaRN [50], Randomized RoPE [56, 30], T5's Bias [55], Alibi [51], Kerple [13], and FIRE [40]. For RoPE, the randomized positional encoding [56,30] is applied to enhance the model performance, extending the randomized length to four times that of the training length. Datasets. Our analysis involves training language models on the Arxiv and Books3 datasets, which are frequently used benchmarks for evaluating model performance [51, 13, 40, 24]. We start our evaluation by comparing the last 256 tokens' zero-shot perplexity across different input lengths. Besides perplexity as evaluation metrics, we also employ the downstream datasets in randomized positional encoding [56] to evaluate CAPE, where details are included in Appendix D. Experiment settings. Initially, we compare CAPE with other baselines at training lengths of 128, 512, and 1024, with model size 125M decoder-only Transformers [9], whose configuration is shown in Appendix B. Subsequently, we evaluate the performance of larger model size 350M, CAPE variants and explore the impact of hidden dimension of MLPs $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$. We also examine the computational efficiency of CAPE, focusing on processing times. Additionally, we provide visualizations of the CAPE bias in the Appendix F. Finally, we also evaluate CAPE on algorithmic reasoning datasets via accuracy metrics. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_775f543e27a1d21a8d2ag-06.jpg?height=720&width=1277&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=421)\n\nFigure 2: Comparisons with baselines: performance with training lengths 128 and 512 on Arxiv and Books3 datasets. ### 4.1 Comparisons with Baselines\n\nCAPE's superior performance within training length and beyond training length, compared to all baselines. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 5, CAPE consistently outperforms established baselines such as RoPE, Alibi, and Kerple across various settings. Notably, CAPE-Kerple (the positional information in CAPE comes from Kerple bias matrices) outstands in both short and long training lengths (128 and 512), compared to previous RoPE, T5's bias, and so on. It demonstrates that the semantic adaptivity of CAPE significantly enhances its state-of-the-art performance against all other static positional encoding methods. The performance on longer training length 1024. As shown in Figure 3, the proposed method consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance for the training length of 1024. When the evaluation extends to 2048, both CAPEKerple and CAPE-FIRE achieve notable results, recording performances of 3.91 and 3.93 perplexity scores, respectively. Remarkably, CAPEFIRE behaves well at the longer evaluation length of 8192, achieving a performance of 3.91 scores and surpassing Alibi's score of 4.28. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_775f543e27a1d21a8d2ag-06.jpg?height=394&width=700&top_left_y=1511&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: Results on the training length 1024. These findings reveal that CAPE sustains robust performance with a longer training length of 1024. CAPE enhances intra-length performance, indicating that its lower perplexity may come from thorough utilization of entire sentences but not disregarding long-distance information (Also proved in Figure 1). Compared to Alibi, Kerple, and FIRE, the adapted versions CAPEAlibi, CAPE-Kerple, and CAPE-FIRE demonstrate consistently and significantly better intra-length performance. With the growing sequence length, the Alibi tends to transition from full attention to almost local attention, and this is why Alibi is worse than most baselines within training length but better beyond training lengths. The results (as shown in Table 5) indicate that the superior intralength performance of CAPE is statistically significant, with a p-value less than 0.05 . Therefore, the consistent intra-length performances across various training lengths indicate that the lower perplexity of CAPE results from effectively utilizing the entire sequence, rather than focusing on local parts and neglecting long-distance information. CAPE significantly improves length extrapolation performance, compared to ALibi, Kerple, and FIRE. CAPE-Kerple significantly surpasses competitors like vanilla Kerple when training and evaluating at different lengths. On the Arxiv dataset trained at a length of 128, CAPE-Kerple achieves a remarkably low perplexity of 5.00 at an evaluation length of 8192 , in stark contrast to Kerple's 31.93 . Similarly, on the Books3 dataset with a training length of 512, CAPE-Kerple records a perplexity of 17.88 at the same extended evaluation length, far outperforming Kerple's 39.31. These results affirm that CAPE, through its semantic adaptivity and flexibility, consistently enhances performance beyond training lengths, eclipsing static positional encoding methods. ### 4.2 The Effect of Model Size\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_775f543e27a1d21a8d2ag-07.jpg?height=423&width=1270&top_left_y=664&top_left_x=426)\n\nFigure 4: The effect of model size: for the 350M model, the performance with training lengths 128 and 512 on the Arxiv dataset. CAPE enhances performance with increasing model sizes. As the model size grows (as shown in Figure 4), CAPE consistently demonstrates an improvement in performance metrics. When the model size is augmented from 125 M to 350 M , the perplexity at an evaluation sequence length of 8192 (with a training length of 512) for CAPE-Alibi shows a notable decrease from 3.82 to 3.57 . These numbers are appreciably smaller than those recorded for original Alibi, which decreases from 4.54 to 4.21 in perplexity, indicating a robust performance improvement. Additionally, CAPE-Kerple significantly reduces the perplexity for Kerple, bringing it down from an initial 22.76 to an impressive 3.43. These results confirm that CAPE retains its efficacy and continues to perform well even as the model size is increased, mainly due to the adoption of semantically adaptive PEs. CAPE methods almost are ranked top- 3 with large model size. With the incremental model size, CAPE-FIRE begins to match, and nearly approach, the performance levels of Alibi. Initially, at a model size of 125 M and a training length of 512, CAPE-FIRE achieves a perplexity of 5.71 at an evaluation sequence length of 8192 , while Alibi stands at a perplexity of 4.54 . However, as the model size is increased to 350 M , the performance gap significantly narrows. Specifically, CAPE-FIRE outperforms Alibi regarding the perplexity scores when the evaluation length is smaller than 4096, as the model size grows for evaluation. In conclusion, as shown in Figure 4, we observe that the CAPE methods almost win the top-3 among all positional encoding methods. This trend underlines the scalability and adaptability of CAPE, emphasizing its potential to handle more substantial computation challenges. ### 4.3 Different Variants of CAPE\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of CAPE across its various forms. Our analysis focuses on CAPE-Kerple. Notably, as shown in Figure 5, all variants of CAPE surpass the baseline performance of Kerple. The Addition_Residual variant of CAPE, while requiring less computational effort, delivers relatively inferior results. As illustrated in Figure 5, concatenation methods (either Concat or Concat_Residual) outperform the Addition_Residual approach, for both the training length of 128 and 512. Furthermore, both Concat and Concat_Residual exhibit comparable performance metrics. Specifically, at a training length of 128, Concat_Residual records a score of 5.00 and Concat scores 5.03 at an evaluation length of 8192, whereas Add_Residual posts a 5.17 perplexity score. With a training length of 512, Concat_Residual achieves a score of 3.70, and Concat scores 3.69 at an evaluation length of 8192, compared to Add_Residual's 3.75. Based on the current observation, the different variants of CAPE show comparable performances, compared to baselines. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_775f543e27a1d21a8d2ag-08.jpg?height=366&width=1273&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=425)\n\nFigure 5: Different variants of CAPE: the CAPE-Alibi performance under different variants.

The experiments are conducted with Alibi and CAPE-Alibi. As shown in Appendix Figure 6, when considering the training length 128 and $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ is set as 4 , the CAPE-Alibi achieves 8.25 at evaluation length 128 and 5.67 at length 8192 , which is better than Alibi's 8.31 and 5.85 . Whatever $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ is 4,1632 , or 64 , the performance is always better than the original Alibi at all evaluation lengths. This suggests the effectiveness of CAPE, even with smaller $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$\n\nThe choice of $D_{\\text {CAPE }} . \\quad$ Based on the experiment, overly small values of $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ can degrade performance, although they still perform better than the baseline. Conversely, larger values of $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ increase computational costs. The function $f(\\cdot)$ is implemented as a two-layer MLP, where the input dimension is either the head number or twice the head number, and the output dimension is the head number. Therefore, we recommend setting the hidden dimension to the head number to prevent information loss and ensure the capacity of $f(\\cdot)$. ### 4.5 The Time Cost\n\nTable 1: The computation cost under different testing lengths, with $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ as 32 and default batch size 32. | Method | $D_{\\text {CAPE }}$ | Length 128 |  | Length 512 |  | Length 2048 |  |  | Length 2048 \\& Batch 1 |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  |  | Forward | Backward | Forward | Backward | Forward | Backward | Memory (GB) | Forward | Backward |\n| Rope | - | 19.65 | 50.34 | 50.85 | 168.72 | 371.69 | 1237.55 | 22.1 | 26.79 | 67.62 |\n| T5's bias | - | 17.16 | 44.74 | 54.11 | 181.43 | 684.78 | 2010.62 | 21.9 | 36.22 | 424.04 |\n| Alibi | - | 16.68 | 41.05 | 53.34 | 139.23 | 463.00 | 1052.32 | 23.2 | 21.40 | 53.58 |\n| CAPE-Alibi | 16 | 21.20 | 50.58 | 117.05 | 256.53 | 1685.45 | 3492.63 | 31.4 | 53.67 | 107.16 |\n| CAPE-Alibi | 32 | 22.12 | 52.49 | 133.51 | 285.55 | 1950.39 | 3960.20 | 41.4 | 61.41 | 121.32 |\n| Kerple | - | 18.17 | 44.34 | 54.17 | 145.95 | 463.74 | 1103.53 | 22.3 | 28.41 | 74.23 |\n| CAPE-Kerple | 16 | 22.04 | 54.35 | 117.15 | 292.76 | 1683.95 | 4045.51 | 30.5 | 60.51 | 132.69 |\n| CAPE-Kerple | 32 | 23.38 | 54.48 | 133.36 | 320.44 | 1950.80 | 4508.87 | 40.6 | 60.69 | 133.34 |\n| FIRE | - | 21.08 | 53.71 | 64.12 | 162.19 | 734.01 | 1406.39 | 22.3 | 52.02 | 113.91 |\n| CAPE-FIRE | 16 | 25.78 | 65.90 | 130.85 | 312.98 | 2192.95 | 4603.17 | 30.7 | 87.91 | 166.26 |\n| CAPE-FIRE | 32 | 26.80 | 66.03 | 146.54 | 342.65 | 2457.05 | 5091.79 | 41.1 | 100.59 | 195.41 |\n\nPractical additional time cost. The theoretical analysis of the computational cost for CAPE is presented in Section 3.2. For relatively short training lengths (e.g., 128), as detailed in Table 1, the forward step times are $16.68 \\mathrm{~ms}, 18.17 \\mathrm{~ms}$, and 21.08 ms for Alibi, Kerple, and FIRE, respectively. Incorporating CAPE increases these times slightly to $22.12 \\mathrm{~ms}, 23.38 \\mathrm{~ms}$, and 26.80 ms , respectively. As training length extends to 512, the forward and backward times increase to approximately 2.5 to 3 times those of the baselines. With a batch size reduction from 32 to 1, the forward step time for FIRE escalates to 52.02 ms , while CAPE reaches 100.59 ms . Future optimizations may focus on enhancing the efficiency of MLP and I/O operations to further accelerate CAPE. ### 4.6 The Visualization of CAPE\n\nIn this subsection, we present the visualization of learned positional encoding biases from a CAPEKerple model pretrained on Arxiv (training length is 512). We plot the learned positional encoding bias for the query token at the 8192 th position, for all the attention heads from selected layers in\n\nTable 2: Train on length 40 with 200k steps, and test from lengths 41 to 500.

We would like to highlight two features of CAPE. First, in different attention heads, the bias matrix of CAPE learns both local and \"anti-local\" attention patterns that emphasize more on far-away keys (just like FIRE), compared to a fixed local inductive bias (such as Kerple and Alibi). Secondly, the bias matrix can be dynamically adjusted with different attention values, compared to the static bias fixed for all attentions. We have shown more examples, including different layers and different samples, in Appendix F. ### 4.7 Experiments on CHE Benchmark\n\nBesides employing perplexity as an evaluation metric, we also evaluated CAPE on downstream Chomsky Hierarchy Evaluation Benchmark (CHE) [21] (need to utilize the whole sentence information to generate correct answers) to further discuss its effects. The experimental setup follows randomized positional encodings [56], detailed in Table 4, with the experiment setting shown in Appendix Section D. Overall, FIRE outperforms Kerple in 9 out of 14 tasks, while Kerple outperforms Alibi in 11 out of 14 tasks. This observation aligns with findings in [40], suggesting that the experiments in Table 2 are reliable and reflect the performance of positional encoding in downstream tasks. CAPE works better on permutation-variant tasks. CAPE (with Kerple and FIRE) presented the best performance in 10 out of 11 permutation-variant tasks (which require positional information), achieving the second-best performance in the SOLVE EQUATION task. This underscores the efficacy of CAPE with semantic adaptivity in handling permutation-variant challenges. CAPE's performance on permutation-invariant tasks. In tasks that are permutation-invariant, where positional information is non-critical, CAPE demonstrated comparable performance. Notably, CAPE-Alibi achieved scores of 50.30 on PARITY CHECK and 99.38 on BUCKET SORT tasks, compared to the highest scores of 50.97 and 99.57 , respectively, demonstrating competitive performances. Comparative performance improvements. CAPE consistently enhanced performance across various tasks, especially on permutation-variant tasks. Specifically, CAPE improved upon Alibi and FIRE's results in all 11 tested permutation-invariant tasks. Similarly, it outperformed Kerple in 10 of these tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of CAPE over static positional encoding methods like Alibi, Kerple, and FIRE, resulting from its dynamic adaptivity. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we propose the context-adaptive positional encoding (CAPE) by incorporating both the semantic and the positional information to improve the model performance. We show that the additional computation introduced by CAPE is not significant under proper choices of hyperparameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Arxiv, Books3, and CHE to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing that the adaptive PE method has advantages over static PEs. We believe that the CAPE could benefit the whole community, especially on length generalization tasks. ## References\n\n[1] Muhammad Adnan, Akhil Arunkumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant J Nair, Ilya Soloveychik, and Purushotham Kamath.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.75)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.53)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Score: 0.36)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Tianle Cai, Yuhong Li, Zhengyang Geng, Hongwu Peng, Jason D. Lee, De-huai Chen, Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel using a tree-based attention mechanism, and proposes several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) employ auto-regressive decoding that requires sequential computation, with each step reliant on the previous one's output. This creates a bottleneck as each step necessitates moving the full model parameters from High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the accelerator's cache. While methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue, their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mechanism, Medusa constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them simultaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, Medusa substantially reduces the number of decoding steps required. We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for Medusa to meet the needs of different use cases: Medusa-1: Medusa is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM, enabling lossless inference acceleration. Medusa-2: Medusa is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling better prediction accuracy of Medusa heads and higher speedup but needing a special training recipe that preserves the backbone model's capabilities. Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa, including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while maintaining generation quality. We evaluate Medusa on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our experiments demonstrate that Medusa-1 can achieve over 2.2x speedup without compromising generation quality, while Medusa-2 further improves the speedup to 2.3-3.6x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 142  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 3. Break the Sequential Dependency of LLM Inference Using Lookahead Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Yichao Fu, Peter D. Bailis, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lookahead decoding is introduced, an exact, parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates LLM decoding without needing auxiliary models or data stores, is more parallelizable on single or multiple modern accelerators, and is compatible with concurrent memory-efficient attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive decoding of large language models (LLMs) is memory bandwidth bounded, resulting in high latency and significant wastes of the parallel processing power of modern accelerators. Existing methods for accelerating LLM decoding often require a draft model (e.g., speculative decoding), which is nontrivial to obtain and unable to generalize. In this paper, we introduce Lookahead decoding, an exact, parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates LLM decoding without needing auxiliary models or data stores. It allows trading per-step log(FLOPs) to reduce the number of total decoding steps, is more parallelizable on single or multiple modern accelerators, and is compatible with concurrent memory-efficient attention (e.g., FlashAttention). Our implementation of Lookahead decoding can speed up autoregressive decoding by up to 1.8x on MT-bench and 4x with strong scaling on multiple GPUs in code completion tasks.

On Model Parallelization and Scheduling Strategies for Distributed Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Seunghak Lee, Jin Kyu Kim, Xun Zheng, Qirong Ho, Garth A. Gibson, E. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs, which enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models, and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed machine learning has typically been approached from a data parallel perspective, where big data are partitioned to multiple workers and an algorithm is executed concurrently over different data subsets under various synchronization schemes to ensure speed-up and/or correctness. A sibling problem that has received relatively less attention is how to ensure efficient and correct model parallel execution of ML algorithms, where parameters of an ML program are partitioned to different workers and undergone concurrent iterative updates. We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design, algorithmic adjustment, and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we develop a system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs. STRADS enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models, and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML. We demonstrate the efficacy of model-parallel algorithms implemented on STRADS versus popular implementations for topic modeling, matrix factorization, and Lasso.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 112  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. GateLoop: Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet attention implementation parallelization*\n\n*Tobias Katsch*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear Recurrence has proven to be a powerful tool for modeling long sequences efficiently. In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, such as RetNet, focusing on its multi-head attention variant, parallelization techniques, memory optimization, integration with positional encodings, and performance analysis, here are some key points and references:\n\n## RetNet's Multi-Head Attention Variant Implementation Details\n- RetNet uses a variant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, which is made feasible by its special case of linear State Space Models (SSMs). This approach allows for efficient parallelization of computations.\n- The multi-head attention in RetNet splits the dimensionality into multiple heads, each computing attention independently. This enhances the model's capacity to capture diverse sequential information while reducing computational costs for matrix operations.\n\n## Parallelization Techniques in RetNet and Similar Architectures\n- RetNet achieves parallelization through its multi-head attention mechanism, which allows the computation of attention for each head in parallel. This is particularly beneficial for large language models where parallel training is crucial.\n- The use of structured arrangements, such as integrating the SSM block (token mixer) into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, helps in increasing the state size without adding extra parameters, facilitating efficient parallelization.\n\n## Memory Optimization Methods in Attention-Based Models\n- To optimize memory, techniques like sharing-based attention can be employed, where key and value heads are shared among multi-query heads. This reduces the number of parameters and memory consumption, especially when dealing with long sequence lengths.\n- Another approach is using sparse attention methods, such as those described in the SeerAttention paper, which downsample the query and key matrices to reduce the size of the attention map, significantly lowering memory usage during inference.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Attention Mechanisms with Positional Encodings\n- Integrating different positional encoding methods, such as functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation (FIRE), requires careful consideration to preserve the efficiency and benefits of RetNet's architecture. This involves ensuring that the new encoding methods do not compromise the parallelization capabilities and memory efficiency of the model.\n- The use of a two-hop residual approach can help balance the interdependence between attention mechanisms and FFN layers, allowing for a global perspective while maintaining local context understanding.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Different Attention Implementations in Long-Sequence Processing\n- Performance analysis involves comparing different attention implementations, such as sparse attention methods (e.g., SeerAttention) and traditional multi-head attention. Studies show that sparse attention can significantly reduce computational costs and memory usage while maintaining performance, especially in long-sequence processing.\n- Evaluating the impact of different positional encoding methods on the model's ability to generalize to longer contexts is also crucial. For example, the FIRE method has been shown to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory Efficiency and Stability**: Ensuring that the model's memory efficiency is maintained is critical, especially when dealing with long sequences. Techniques like pruning (e.g., SynFlow) and efficient optimizer updates can help reduce memory load and improve training stability.\n- **Parallel Training**: Efficient parallel training is essential for large language models. Methods that allow for parallel computation of attention heads and other components can significantly speed up training times.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can improve the design of autoregressive language models like RetNet, enhancing their performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors is proposed, which enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.13572, 2024.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLeo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, et al. 2020.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/19 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

Besides algorithms manipulating explicit position features, the success of Transformers without position encodings (NoPE) provides a new way to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE's generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads' best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE's context size.

The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: RoPE positional encoding context length*\n\n*Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Inkit Padhi, K. Ramamurthy, Payel Das, Siva Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, and NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2.

Csord\u00e1s, Mehdi Abbana Bennani, S. Legg, J. Veness*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work demonstrates that this failure mode is linked to positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences (even for relative encoding) and introduces a novel family of positional encodes that can overcome this problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have impressive generalization capabilities on tasks with a fixed context length. However, they fail to generalize to sequences of arbitrary length, even for seemingly simple tasks such as duplicating a string. Moreover, simply training on longer sequences is inefficient due to the quadratic computation complexity of the global attention mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate that this failure mode is linked to positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences (even for relative encodings) and introduce a novel family of positional encodings that can overcome this problem. Concretely, our randomized positional encoding scheme simulates the positions of longer sequences and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the sequence\u2019s length. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of 6000 models across 15 algorithmic reasoning tasks shows that our method allows Transformers to generalize to sequences of unseen length (increasing test accuracy by 12.0% on average).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3. PoSE: Efficient Context Window Extension of LLMs via Positional Skip-wise Training\n\n*From Search Query: RoPE positional encoding context length*\n\n*Dawei Zhu, Nan Yang, Liang Wang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training that smartly simulates long inputs using a fixed context window is proposed, and can potentially support infinite length, limited only by memory usage in inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with a pre-defined context length, restricting their use in scenarios requiring long inputs. Previous efforts for adapting LLMs to a longer length usually requires fine-tuning with this target length (Full-length fine-tuning), suffering intensive training cost. To decouple train length from target length for efficient context window extension, we propose Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training that smartly simulates long inputs using a fixed context window. This is achieved by first dividing the original context window into several chunks, then designing distinct skipping bias terms to manipulate the position indices of each chunk. These bias terms and the lengths of each chunk are altered for every training example, allowing the model to adapt to all positions within target length. Experimental results show that PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead compared with Full-length fine-tuning, with minimal impact on performance. Leveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMA model to 128k tokens using a 2k training context window. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that PoSE is compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and position interpolation strategies. Notably, our method can potentially support infinite length, limited only by memory usage in inference. With ongoing progress for efficient inference, we believe PoSE can further scale the context window beyond 128k.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models beyond a Fixed-Length Context\n\n*From Search Query: RoPE positional encoding context length*\n\n*Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, R. Salakhutdinov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence, which consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3435  (*Influential: 403*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: RoPE positional encoding context length*\n\n*Enrico Shippole, Honglu Fan, Jeffrey Quesnelle, Bowen Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode positional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset.

LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: RoPE positional encoding context length*\n\n*Sujian Li, Furu Wei, Wenhao Wu, YiFan Song, Nan Yang, Liang Wang, Dawei Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of multiple positional encoding methods, computational efficiency, context length extension, stability analysis, and memory efficiency, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Integration of Multiple Positional Encoding Methods\n\n- The concept of integrating multiple positional encoding methods, such as Resonance RoPE, RoPE Scaling Laws, and YaRN, into a single architecture like RetNet's MultiScaleRetention is novel and promising. Research papers like \"Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models\" (Wang et al., 2024) provide insights into how Resonance RoPE can be integrated and its theoretical framework for feature interpolation.\n- The interaction between these methods and the existing retention mechanism in RetNet needs careful analysis. For instance, understanding how different positional encoding methods affect the model's ability to handle varying sequence lengths is crucial. This can be explored by analyzing the compatibility and potential implementation challenges of these methods within RetNet's architecture.\n\n## Computational Efficiency of Different Positional Encoding Approaches\n\n- The computational efficiency of different positional encoding methods is a critical factor. For example, sinusoidal positional encoding, as used in traditional transformers, is computationally efficient due to its ability to handle shifts through linear transformations.\n- Advanced methods like Resonance RoPE may offer better context length generalization but could come with additional computational costs. Investigating the theoretical computational complexity and potential bottlenecks of these methods is essential. Papers like \"Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding\" (Yen et al., 2024) can provide insights into parallel processing approaches that might enhance efficiency.\n\n## Context Length Extension Techniques\n\n- Extending the context length in language models is a significant area of research. Techniques such as those described in \"LM-Infinite: Zero-Shot Extreme Length Generalization for Large Language Models\" (Han et al., 2023) and \"Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models\" (Wang et al., 2024) offer methods for extreme length generalization and improved context length handling.\n- The effectiveness of combined positional encoding approaches on context length generalization needs thorough analysis. This includes studying the limitations and trade-offs between context length and model performance.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Positional Encoding Modifications\n\n- Ensuring the stability of the model after integrating multiple positional encoding methods is crucial. This involves analyzing the potential interactions between different methods and verifying the stability of the combined approach.\n- Research on similar architectural modifications, such as those discussed in \"Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models\" (Sun et al., 2023), can provide valuable insights into maintaining model stability.\n\n## Memory Efficiency in Long-Sequence Processing\n\n- Memory efficiency is a significant concern when processing long sequences. The integration of multiple positional encoding methods should be analyzed for its impact on memory usage.\n- Papers like \"Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding\" (Yen et al., 2024) discuss parallel processing approaches that can help in reducing memory requirements while handling long sequences.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating multiple positional encoding methods can be complex. Researching existing implementations and identifying potential challenges is essential. This includes ensuring that the combined approach does not introduce significant implementation overhead.\n- **Performance Trade-offs**: Investigating the theoretical impact on computational efficiency and memory usage, as well as the potential trade-offs between context length and model performance, is critical. This will help in balancing the benefits of advanced positional encoding methods with the practical constraints of model training and deployment.\n- **Scalability**: The behavior of the model with very long sequences and different model sizes needs to be verified. Assessing resource requirements at scale is also necessary to ensure that the model remains efficient and scalable.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and leveraging the insights from the referenced papers, the researchers can develop a more robust and efficient autoregressive language model that excels in handling long sequences and varying context lengths.\n",

CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation (Avg.

Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors.

However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors.

The transformer mainly consists of attention block, feed-forward block, and positional encoding. Recent works [8] have proved that quadratic-cost attention from the softmax is necessary for better performance, especially in long-context processing. The attention block was originally designed by applying softmax to the key-query multiplication, which requires quadratic computational cost. To address such challenges, some efficient transformers were proposed, including sliding window transformers (e.g., Streaming LLMs [76]), linear transformers (e.g., Performer [17]), and sparse transformers (e.g., Reformer and sparse Sinkhorn transformer [65]), etc. However, some negative results exist regarding efficient transformers' performances [79]. It has been noticed recently that well-designed positional encoding significantly improves the model performances, especially in the long-context tasks [32]. While transformer-based models exhibit satisfying performances in tasks of consistent length and distribution, their effectiveness tends to diminish sharply when the input length exceeds the training length, e.g., long document summarization, \"needle in a haystack\" search, and long text generation. To avoid the expensive computation in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_775f543e27a1d21a8d2ag-02.jpg?height=354&width=1360&top_left_y=228&top_left_x=381)\n\nFigure 1: Visualization of CAPE learned positional biases for the 8192th query position with key positions between 1 and 8192, while the training length is 512 . We notice that CAPE learns both local and anti-local position patterns. The model is trained with Equation 2: (1) The Attention is $\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}$; (2) The Kerple bias is $\\boldsymbol{B}$; (3) The CAPE (with Kerple) bias is $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)$. More examples are shown in Appendix F\ntraining, the training length is usually preferred to be relatively small due to the quadratic cost of softmax-based transformers. However, real-world applications often require processing longer input sequences, posing a significant challenge. Therefore, there is a growing interest in evaluating model performance by training on shorter sequences while testing on longer inputs. Standard transformers may not distinguish the ordering of tokens without external assistance. In practice, they depend on positional encoding to incorporate positional information, enabling the model to make meaningful token predictions. Without these encodings, token generation would lack the necessary contextual order, rendering the outputs nonsensical. The RoPE [61] positional encoding method demonstrated a notable performance degradation, failing entirely when the input length is double that of the training length [50, 10, 24]. A common characteristic among these positional encodings is their pre-defined and static nature. Specifically, they are fixed across various tasks and models, which may lead to their inability to adapt to varying input lengths and contexts effectively. To address this issue, recent works have introduced Functional Interpolation for Relative Positional Encoding (FIRE) [40], which utilizes a neural network to learn an implicit mapping from input positions to positional bias. A functional approach to positional encoding that dynamically adjusts positional biases based on semantic information (input context) allows the model to empower adaptability beyond the fixed inductive bias as adopted in previous studies (such as RoPE [61] and Alibi [51]). Although FIRE utilizes MLPs to learn positional embeddings, these embeddings remain fixed across different tasks once the training is completed. Intuitively, the learned static positional encoding (such as Kerple and FIRE) is an average optimal solution across all training samples. Consequently, while they might be generally effective, they are inherently suboptimal for any specific instance. This static nature limits their flexibility and applicability in various real-world scenarios that deviate from the training context. In this paper, we introduce a context-adaptive positional encoding (CAPE) method, inspired by the limitations of static PEs. CAPE dynamically adjusts the PE based on the semantic information (e.g., the current attention value) $a$ and the positional indicator $b$. The proposed PE is represented by MLPs due to their universal approximatability, i.e., $\\operatorname{MLPs}(a, b)$. We note that CAPE is compatible with all additive relative PEs and offers advantages in terms of interpretability and ease of implementation. The proposed CAPE incorporates both the semantic and the positional information, making the PE adaptive with the input context. The adaptivity allows CAPE to overcome the inflexibility and achieve relatively optimal performance for each individual instance by dynamically adjusting on each specific input context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantically dependent and adaptive positional encoding method introduced in transformer architectures. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some related works on positional encoding methods, including absolute and relative positional encodings as well as the potentially no positional encoding in some transformer models. In Section 3, we introduce the proposed CAPE method with implementation on multi-head attention and analysis on computational costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CAPE, validating its effectiveness and performances on various language tasks and datasets, as reported in Section 4. In Section 5, some concluding remarks and potential future works are presented. ## 2 Related Works\n\nNo positional encoding. Haviv et al. [29] show that decoder-only Transformers with causal attention masks can learn positional information even without any explicit positional encoding. Recently,\n\nKazemnejad et al. [32] proved the effectiveness of no positional encoding (NoPE) [70]. Although the NoPE can implicitly catch the positional information, it performs poorly compared with some explicit positional encoding methods [40]. Absolute positional encoding. Vaswani et al. [68] proposed Absolute positional encoding (APE) to endow transformers with positional information. In particular, in the first layer, a (learnable or fixed sinusoidal) real-valued encoding $[68,34,41,69,46] e_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is assigned to each position $i$, leading to an APE matrix $\\boldsymbol{E}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{e}_{n}\\right]^{\\top}$, which will be added to the input sequence. Though simple and straightforward, APE-based Transformers usually generalize poorly to longer sequences [51]. Relative positional encoding. Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) is another popular way to encode positional information [57, 55, 51], One popular RPE method in large language models is rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [61, 18, 66]. RoPE rotates the query and key vectors with an angle proportional to their absolute positions before the dot product attention, which results in attention being a function of the relative distance between the tokens, capturing the relative positional information.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nPress et al. [51] and Kazemnejad et al. [32] found that RoPE-based language models have poor length generalization. To address this, positional interpolation (PI) [11] is proposed to extend the context window. Following the direction, there are LongLora [12], LongRope [24], YaRN [50] and CLEX [10]. Another popular direction is additive positional encoding. For most of these additive RPE methods, the computation of the (pre-softmax) attention logits can be unified using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is defined as $b(i, j)$. Different formulations and parameterizations of $b$ lead to various RPE variants. Several methodologies that facilitate arbitrary sequence lengths include T5's RPE [55], Alibi [51], Kerple [13], Sandwich [14], and FIRE [40]. Currently, additive RPE delivers relatively robust performance in length extrapolation without necessitating additional operations. Alibi constructs the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B}$ utilizing prior knowledge, resulting in a basis matrix devoid of learnable parameters [51]. Conversely, both Kerple [13] and Sandwich [14] incorporate two learnable parameters to facilitate the learning of a bias matrix while retaining some elements of priors. FIRE suggests adopting a learnable continuous function, such as MLPs, to convert input positions to biases [40]. Observing these developments, it becomes evident that the next generation of bias matrices will likely incorporate adaptivity and flexibility. Based on this insight, we propose our method CAPE, a semantically adaptive method. ## 3 Method\n\nIn this section, we formally introduce CAPE (context-adaptive positional encoding), a new relative positional encoding approach that further enhances transformer performance. Compared with previous works on static positional encoding methods, CAPE adopts semantically adaptive positional bias matrices depending on input context. We first demonstrate that most of the popular positional bias matrices are fixed once the training is finished, independent of the input sequences. To address this limitation, we then accordingly develop CAPE that captures the implicit relationships by MLPs and adjusts the bias matrices based on input context. Furthermore, we discuss a variant of CAPE with residual connections and its extensions to multi-head transformers. ### 3.1 Additive Relative Positional Encoding\n\nFor most additive RPE methods, the computation of pre-softmax attention logits can be unified under the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{RPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\n\nwhere the bias matrix $\\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is induced by the position encoding function $b: \\mathbb{N}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and the $(i, j)$-th entry of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is defined as $b(i, j)$. Various formulations and parameterizations of $b$ give rise to different variants of RPE. Examples of additive RPE include: (1) Alibi: $b(i, j)=-r|i-j|$, with the scaler $r>0$ as a hyper-parameter; (2) Kerple: $b(i, j)=-r_{1} \\log \\left(1+r_{2}|i-j|\\right)$ with $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are two learnable parameters; (3) FIRE: $b(i, j)=f_{\\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\psi(i-j)}{\\psi(\\max \\{L, i\\})}\\right)$, where the positional encoding function $f_{\\theta}$ parameterized by $\\theta$ is learned from data and $\\psi$ is a transformation function aimed at assigning more model capacity to local positions. We observe from the formulation of those additive RPEs that they remain static once the training process is completed and depend solely on the positions, regardless of the input context. This inflexibility and lack of adaptivity can lead to performance degradation, especially in tasks involving long-context generation and reasoning. Intuitively, the learned static RPEs are optimal on average across all training samples. However, this means they are suboptimal when considering each individual instance, as they cannot adapt to specific tasks. To address these challenges and enhance model performance, it is essential to adopt an alternative approach using a semantically adaptive RPE that depends on input context. ### 3.2 Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding\n\nFor simplicity, we first consider the single-head case and the extension to the multi-head transformer will be discussed subsequently. The design of context-adaptive positional encodings in natural language tasks is motivated by the need to capture the intricate relationships between tokens. Arora et al. [5] reveals that associate recall accounts for most of the perplexity difference between transformer, RNN-based, and convolution models. For example, we consider a consistent pairing that \"Hakuna\" is always followed by \"Matata\" in a long paragraph. This pattern suggests a reduced reliance on positional information in favor of enhancing token embedding similarity, thus allowing for 'Hakuna' to be effectively linked with a preceding 'Matata'. Similarly, in tasks involving long-context understanding and search, semantic similarity should be prioritized in the attention mechanism rather than being overshadowed by positional encodings, which can be less relevant over long distances. Consequently, the transformer should preserve information without being influenced overly by positional distance. Instead, a satisfactory PE should integrate both semantic and positional information. Therefore, a semantically dependent positional encoding approach is preferable and expected to enhance model performances. Here, we use the attention $\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}$ to represent the semantic information and positional bias matrices $\\boldsymbol{B}$ (e.g., Alibi and FIRE) to capture positional details. Then the context-adaptive PE is described by $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is an implicit function that integrates both semantic and positional data into the desired positional encodings. Thus, the pre-softmax attention logit incorporated with CAPE is formulated as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mathrm{CAPE}}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}+f\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\\right)^{\\top}, \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $f: \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ is an element-wise function.\n```\n\n#### 2.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/27 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nLeo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, et al. 2020.

Marina*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experiments demonstrate that SPE, without hyperparameter tuning, consistently achieves enhanced fidelity and faster training across various tasks, including 3D view synthesis, Text-to-Speech generation, and 1D regression.\n\n**Abstract:** Fourier features based positional encoding (PE) is commonly used in machine learning tasks that involve learning high-frequency features from low-dimensional inputs, such as 3D view synthesis and time series regression with neural tangent kernels. Despite their effectiveness, existing PEs require manual, empirical adjustment of crucial hyperparameters, specifically the Fourier features, tailored to each unique task. Further, PEs face challenges in efficiently learning high-frequency functions, particularly in tasks with limited data. In this paper, we introduce sinusoidal PE (SPE), designed to efficiently learn adaptive frequency features closely aligned with the true underlying function. Our experiments demonstrate that SPE, without hyperparameter tuning, consistently achieves enhanced fidelity and faster training across various tasks, including 3D view synthesis, Text-to-Speech generation, and 1D regression.

RECOMBINER: Robust and Enhanced Compression with Bayesian Implicit Neural Representations\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive positional encoding implementation efficiency*\n\n*Jiajun He, Gergely Flamich, Zongyu Guo, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.\n\n**Abstract:** COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters' initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.

Previous work has extended recurrent neural networks to model lattice inputs and achieved improvements in various tasks, but these models suffer from very slow computation speeds. This paper extends the recently proposed paradigm of self-attention to handle lattice inputs. Self-attention is a sequence modeling technique that relates inputs to one another by computing pairwise similarities and has gained popularity for both its strong results and its computational efficiency. To extend such models to handle lattices, we introduce probabilistic reachability masks that incorporate lattice structure into the model and support lattice scores if available. We also propose a method for adapting positional embeddings to lattice structures. We apply the proposed model to a speech translation task and find that it outperforms all examined baselines while being much faster to compute than previous neural lattice models during both training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

Recent spiking neuron models like the adaptive Spike Response Model implement adaptation as additive fixed-size fast spike-triggered threshold dynamics and slow spike-triggered currents. Such adaptation accurately models neural spiking behavior over a limited dynamic input range. To extend efficient coding over large changes in dynamic input range, we propose a multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model where the spike-triggered adaptation dynamics are scaled multiplicatively by the adaptation state at the time of spiking. We show that, unlike the additive adaptation model, the firing rate in our multiplicative adaptation model saturates to a realistic maximum spike-rate regardless of input magnitude. Additionally, when simulating variance switching experiments, the model quantitatively fits experimental data over a wide dynamic range. Dynamic threshold models of adaptation furthermore suggest a straightforward interpretation of neural activity in terms of dynamic differential signal encoding with shifted and weighted exponential kernels. We show that when thus encoding rectified filtered stimulus signals, the multiplicative adaptive Spike Response Model achieves a high coding efficiency and maintains this efficiency over changes in the dynamic signal range of several orders of magnitude, without changing model parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2012\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Stratified Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive positional encoding implementation efficiency*\n\n*Jiaya Jia, Xiaojuan Qi, Shu Liu, Hengshuang Zhao, LiWei Wang, Li Jiang, Jianhui Liu, Xin Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** 3D point cloud segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. Most current methods focus on aggregating local features, but fail to directly model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose Stratified Transformer that is able to capture long-range contexts and demonstrates strong generalization ability and high performance. Specifically, we first put forward a novel key sampling strategy. For each query point, we sample nearby points densely and distant points sparsely as its keys in a stratified way, which enables the model to enlarge the effective receptive field and enjoy long-range contexts at a low computational cost. Also, to combat the challenges posed by irregular point arrangements, we propose first-layer point embedding to aggregate local information, which facilitates convergence and boosts performance. Besides, we adopt contextual relative position encoding to adaptively capture position information. Finally, a memory-efficient implementation is introduced to overcome the issue of varying point numbers in each window. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on S3DIS, ScanNetv2 and ShapeNetPart datasets.

Recoil: Parallel rANS Decoding with Decoder-Adaptive Scalability\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive positional encoding implementation efficiency*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Entropy coding is essential to data compression, image and video coding, etc. The Range variant of Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) is a modern entropy coder, featuring superior speed and compression rate. As rANS is not designed for parallel execution, the conventional approach to parallel rANS partitions the input symbol sequence and encodes partitions with independent codecs, and more partitions bring extra overhead. This approach is found in state-of-the-art implementations such as DietGPU. It is unsuitable for content-delivery applications, as the parallelism is wasted if the decoder cannot decode all the partitions in parallel, but all the overhead is still transferred. To solve this, we propose Recoil, a parallel rANS decoding approach with decoder-adaptive scalability. We discover that a single rANS-encoded bitstream can be decoded from any arbitrary position if the intermediate states are known. After renormalization, these states also have a smaller upper bound, which can be stored efficiently. We then split the encoded bitstream using a heuristic to evenly distribute the workload, and store the intermediate states and corresponding symbol indices as metadata. The splits can then be combined simply by eliminating extra metadata entries. The main contribution of Recoil is reducing unnecessary data transfer by adaptively scaling parallelism overhead to match the decoder capability. The experiments show that Recoil decoding throughput is comparable to the conventional approach, scaling massively on CPUs and GPUs and greatly outperforming various other ANS-based codecs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Local Feature Aggregation for Learning on Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive positional encoding implementation efficiency*\n\n*Ran Wei, Hui Yuan, Pan Gao, Zihao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing point cloud learning methods aggregate features from neighbouring points relying on constructing graph in the spatial domain, which results in feature update for each point based on spatially-fixed neighbours throughout layers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic feature aggregation (DFA) method that can transfer information by constructing local graphs in the feature domain without spatial constraints. By finding k-nearest neighbors in the feature domain, we perform relative position encoding and semantic feature encoding to explore latent position and feature similarity information, respectively, so that rich local features can be learned. At the same time, we also learn low-dimensional global features from the original point cloud for enhancing feature representation. Between DFA layers, we dynamically update the constructed local graph structure, so that we can learn richer information, which greatly improves adaptability and efficiency.

This approach allows for a balance between computational efficiency and context length, which is crucial for long sequence processing.\n- \"The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization\" also explores the combination of different positional encoding methods, highlighting the theoretical benefits of methods like NoPE, which can represent both absolute and relative positional encodings without additional computation.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- The \"YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension\" paper introduces a method that requires significantly fewer tokens and training steps than previous methods, which helps in reducing memory usage. This approach effectively utilizes and extrapolates to context lengths much longer than the original pre-training context.\n- Adaptive batching techniques, as discussed in the Restackio article, can also help in optimizing memory usage by dynamically adjusting batch sizes based on incoming requests, ensuring that each request is processed within acceptable time frames while maximizing throughput.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis for Positional Encoding Modifications\n\n- The paper \"Randomized Positional Encodings\" analyzes the stability issues associated with positional encodings, particularly for longer sequences. It introduces a novel family of positional encodings that can overcome the out-of-distribution problem for longer sequences, ensuring better stability during training.\n- The use of layer normalization before multi-headed attention and feedforward layers, as mentioned in the Transformer Wikipedia article, can also stabilize training and reduce the need for learning rate warmup, which is beneficial when modifying positional encoding methods.\n\n## Resource Utilization and Scaling Characteristics of Different Positional Encoding Approaches\n\n- The \"CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation\" paper provides insights into the resource utilization of different positional encoding approaches. It highlights the importance of adaptive methods that can scale efficiently with longer sequences and larger models.\n- The Restackio article on transformer models discusses the importance of batch processing and dynamic batching in optimizing resource utilization. It emphasizes the need to balance batch size with GPU memory limits to ensure efficient scaling.\n\n## Technical Solutions for Integration Challenges in Positional Encoding Combinations\n\n- The integration of multiple positional encoding methods requires careful balance and stability analysis. Papers like \"The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization\" and \"CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation\" provide insights into how different methods can be combined effectively while managing integration complexity.\n- The use of hybrid approaches, as mentioned in the analysis note, involves combining techniques like Resonance RoPE, YaRN, and position-free methods.

We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/43 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32: 8026-8037, 2019.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/27 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nLeo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, et al. 2020.

Score: 0.32)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/74 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4 layer to a special case where the state dimension is $N=1$. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be viewed as a special case of a linear SSM. Its primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large head dimension, which can be viewed as another method to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context of linear attention variants was first done by H 3 , but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation. RetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case of SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 0 related papers from 0 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: RetNet implementation memory efficiency stability\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on RetNet and related aspects such as memory efficiency, stability, and positional encoding strategies, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## RetNet Architecture Implementation Details and Optimizations\n\n- RetNet, as a successor to Transformer models, is designed to handle large language models efficiently. The architecture involves modifications to the traditional Transformer structure to improve performance on long sequences. For instance, RetNet uses a combination of recurrent and attention mechanisms to reduce the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- Memory efficiency is crucial for processing long sequences. Techniques such as block-sparse attention, as seen in SeerAttention, can be beneficial. SeerAttention introduces a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel that demonstrates linear speedup over various sparsity levels, which can be integrated into RetNet-like architectures to improve memory efficiency.\n\n- Another approach is the use of gated linear attention (GLA) in Transformers, which allows for efficient parallel training and linear-time inference complexity. GLA Transformers, like those described in Lina-Speech, can generalize well to longer sequences without significant perplexity degradation, which is important for memory management in long sequence processing.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis with Modified Positional Encodings\n\n- Training stability can be enhanced by using adaptive positional encoding methods. For example, Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) dynamically adjusts the positional encoding based on semantic information, which improves generalization to longer sequences and stability during training[Analysis Note].\n\n- Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE) is another method that improves Transformer generalization to longer contexts through progressive interpolation of relative position encodings. This approach can help in maintaining training stability by providing a more robust positional encoding scheme[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Different Positional Encoding Approaches\n\n- Combining multiple positional encoding methods requires careful balance. For instance, integrating semantic information with positional encoding, as in CAPE, can enhance position representation. Additionally, using a combination of relative position encodings like those in FIRE and adaptive methods can provide better generalization capabilities[Analysis Note].\n\n- In the context of RetNet, integrating different positional encoding approaches, such as using both CAPE and FIRE, would require managing the integration complexity to ensure stability and memory efficiency. This could involve using separate RoPE within the attention gate, similar to the approach in SeerAttention, to maintain positional information across different block lengths.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different Positional Encoding Strategies\n\n- Performance comparisons between different positional encoding strategies are crucial. For example, the CAPE paper shows that dynamic adjustment of positional encoding improves performance and generalization to longer sequences. Similarly, the FIRE paper demonstrates that functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation enhances Transformer performance on long contexts[Analysis Note].\n\n- In the context of RetNet, comparing the performance of different positional encoding strategies, such as CAPE, FIRE, and traditional RoPE, would help in identifying the most effective approach for long sequence processing. This comparison should consider metrics such as perplexity, training stability, and memory efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to improve RetNet and similar autoregressive language models, researchers should focus on:\n\n- Implementing block-sparse attention and gated linear attention to enhance memory efficiency.\n- Using adaptive positional encoding methods like CAPE and FIRE to improve generalization and stability.\n- Carefully integrating multiple positional encoding approaches to balance performance and complexity.\n- Conducting thorough performance comparisons to identify the best strategies for long sequence processing.\n",

While the Retentive Network (RetNet) architecture introduces an efficient sequence modeling mechanism with its MultiScaleRetention unit, it inherits limitations in context length generalization due to its reliance on Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Models using RoPE often struggle with sequences longer than those encountered during training, leading to performance degradation when processing longer inputs.

This limitation arises due to:\n\n- **Fixed Base Value**: The choice of the base value in RoPE determines the frequency spectrum of the positional embeddings. A fixed base value restricts the model's capacity to encode positional information for longer sequences.\n\n- **Extrapolation Issues**: RoPE's periodic nature causes embeddings at unseen positions to be out-of-distribution, leading to degradation in attention mechanisms and overall model performance.\n\n### Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nThe core idea is to integrate advanced positional encoding methods into the MultiScaleRetention unit to improve context length generalization by:\n\n1. **Adjusting the RoPE Base Value**: Utilizing insights from the Scaling Laws of RoPE to select an appropriate base value that enhances extrapolation capabilities.\n\n2. **Implementing Resonance RoPE**: Refining the interpolation of RoPE features for out-of-distribution positions, ensuring smoother transitions and better generalization.\n\n3. **Incorporating YaRN's Scaling Techniques**: Efficiently extending the context window with minimal additional training data by adjusting scaling factors in the positional encoding.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\n#### Scaling Laws of RoPE\n\nThe extrapolation upper bound \\( T_{\\text{extra}} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{extra}} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\beta^{d_{\\text{extra}} / d}\n\\]\n\n- \\( \\beta \\): RoPE base value.\n- \\( d_{\\text{extra}} \\): Critical dimension for extrapolation.\n- \\( d \\): Model dimension.\n\nBy adjusting \\( \\beta \\), we can increase \\( T_{\\text{extra}} \\), allowing the model to generalize to longer sequences.\n\n#### Resonance RoPE Interpolation\n\nResonance RoPE modifies the positional embeddings by refining the interpolation for out-of-distribution positions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{RoPE}_{\\text{Res}}(p) = \\cos(\\theta_p) + \\sin(\\theta_p)\n\\]\n\n- \\( \\theta_p \\): Adjusted positional angle based on position \\( p \\) and scaling factors.\n\nThis ensures that the model smoothly transitions to embeddings for unseen positions.\n\n#### Integration of YaRN Scaling\n\nYaRN introduces an adjusted scaling of the positional encodings:\n\n\\[\n\\theta_p' = \\theta_p \\cdot s\n\\]\n\n- \\( s \\): Scaling factor determined by the ratio of extended context length to original context length.\n\nBy scaling the positional angles, we effectively extend the context window.\n\n### Trade-Offs and Solutions\n\n- **Performance on Short Sequences**: Adjusting the base value may affect performance on shorter sequences. Careful selection and validation are necessary to balance performance across sequence lengths.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating these methods adds complexity. However, since modifications are localized within the positional encoding mechanism, the overall architectural changes are minimal.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection MultiScaleRetention```\n\n### Overview of Modifications\n\n1. **Adjust the RoPE Base Value**: Modify the base value \\( \\beta \\) in the RoPE implementation to enhance extrapolation capacity based on the Scaling Laws.\n\n2. **Integrate Resonance RoPE**: Replace the standard RoPE with Resonance RoPE to refine interpolation for out-of-distribution positions.\n\n3. **Incorporate YaRN's Scaling**: Adjust the scaling of positional angles in the RoPE to effectively extend the context window without extensive retraining.\n\n### Detailed Descriptions\n\n#### Adjusting RoPE Base Value\n\n- **Objective**: Increase the critical dimension for extrapolation, \\( d_{\\text{extra}} \\), thus enlarging \\( T_{\\text{extra}} \\).\n\n- **Implementation**: Change the base value \\( \\beta \\) in the RoPE frequency calculations.\n\n- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\theta_d = \\frac{1}{\\beta^{2d / d_{\\text{model}}}}\n  \\]\n\n  Adjust \\( \\beta \\) to a value \\( \\beta' \\) such that:\n\n  \\[\n  \\beta' = \\beta \\cdot k\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( k \\) is a scaling constant determined empirically.\n\n#### Integrating Resonance RoPE\n\n- **Objective**: Improve interpolation of positional embeddings for unseen positions.\n\n- **Implementation**:\n  -
