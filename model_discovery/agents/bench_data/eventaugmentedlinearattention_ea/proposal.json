Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Since the green keys $k_{2}, k_{5}$ map to the same code, they have the same attention weights in this attention head. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nTransformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) language models would ideally scale to long sequences, since their predictive abilities often improve as context length increases (Dai et al., 2019, Kaplan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the standard transformer uses a self-attention mechanism with a quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length. This limits the practicality of applying transformers to very long sequences, since increasing the sequence length by a factor of $10^{n}$ increases the attention computations by a factor of $100^{n}$. Transformer variants that overcome this efficiency bottleneck have the potential to facilitate new long-context applications and enable new breakthroughs. Up to this point, a variety of efficient transformers (Tay et al., 2020b) have been proposed to scale to long sequences. Techniques include sparsity (Child et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020. Kitaev et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020; Roy et al.| 2021; Tay et al., 2020a; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, Wu et al.||2022|, Liu et al.|| 2023; Zhang et al.||2023), compression (Liu et al.||2018; Rae et al. 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Zhu et al.| 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Nawrot et al., 2021; 2023), low-rank approximations (Wang et al. 2020; Vyas et al., 2020, Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2021, Tay et al. 2021, Choromanski et al., 2021), and cross-attention operations (Dai et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2021; Hutchins et al., 2022;, Hawthorne et al., 2022). Other efficient sequence models have also been proposed (Gu et al., 2022; Lee-Thorp et al. 2022; Mehta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022, Hasani et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/43 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. $1631-1642,2013$.

Interpretable Relevant Emotion Ranking with Event-Driven Attention\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven attention*\n\n*Yang Yang, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He, Meng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel interpretable relevant emotion ranking model with the event information incorporated into a deep learning architecture using the event-driven attentions is proposed and interpretable results can be obtained to shed light on the events which trigger certain emotions.\n\n**Abstract:** Multiple emotions with different intensities are often evoked by events described in documents. Oftentimes, such event information is hidden and needs to be discovered from texts. Unveiling the hidden event information can help to understand how the emotions are evoked and provide explainable results. However, existing studies often ignore the latent event information. In this paper, we proposed a novel interpretable relevant emotion ranking model with the event information incorporated into a deep learning architecture using the event-driven attentions. Moreover, corpus-level event embeddings and document-level event distributions are introduced respectively to consider the global events in corpus and the document-specific events simultaneously. Experimental results on three real-world corpora show that the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the state-of-the-art emotion detection approaches and multi-label approaches. Moreover, interpretable results can be obtained to shed light on the events which trigger certain emotions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. EvTexture: Event-driven Texture Enhancement for Video Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven attention*\n\n*Dachun Kai, Jiayao Lu, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the first VSR method that utilizes event signals for texture enhancement, which leverages high-frequency details of events to better recover texture regions in VSR.\n\n**Abstract:** Event-based vision has drawn increasing attention due to its unique characteristics, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. It has been used in video super-resolution (VSR) recently to enhance the flow estimation and temporal alignment. Rather than for motion learning, we propose in this paper the first VSR method that utilizes event signals for texture enhancement. Our method, called EvTexture, leverages high-frequency details of events to better recover texture regions in VSR. In our EvTexture, a new texture enhancement branch is presented. We further introduce an iterative texture enhancement module to progressively explore the high-temporal-resolution event information for texture restoration. This allows for gradual refinement of texture regions across multiple iterations, leading to more accurate and rich high-resolution details. Experimental results show that our EvTexture achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets. For the Vid4 dataset with rich textures, our method can get up to 4.67dB gain compared with recent event-based methods.

CLaM-TTS: Improving Neural Codec Language Model for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization in attention*\n\n*Jaehyeon Kim, Keon Lee, Seungjun Chung, Jaewoong Cho*\n\n**TL;DR:** CLaM-TTS is presented that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to achieve superior compression in the token length, and allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams.\n\n**Abstract:** With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Grounded Object-Centric Learning\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization in attention*\n\n*A.

Learning grounded representations of objects that are guaranteed to be stable and invariant promises robust performance across different tasks and environments. Slot Attention (SA) learns object-centric representations by assigning objects to \\textit{slots}, but presupposes a \\textit{single} distribution from which all slots are randomly initialised. This results in an inability to learn \\textit{specialized} slots which bind to specific object types and remain invariant to identity-preserving changes in object appearance. To address this, we present \\emph{\\textsc{Co}nditional \\textsc{S}lot \\textsc{A}ttention} (\\textsc{CoSA}) using a novel concept of \\emph{Grounded Slot Dictionary} (GSD) inspired by vector quantization. Our proposed GSD comprises (i) canonical object-level property vectors and (ii) parametric Gaussian distributions, which define a prior over the slots. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in multiple downstream tasks such as scene generation, composition, and task adaptation, whilst remaining competitive with SA in popular object discovery benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

However, mechanisms to explain its capabilities are not well understood. Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process within the Transformer.

Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error, measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments.

Melo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture and shows that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture and variants presented remarkable success across many machine learning tasks in recent years. This success is intrinsically related to the capability of handling long sequences and the presence of context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism. We argue that these capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven attention*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Spike-driven Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven attention*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Bo Xu, Yonghong Tian, Li Yuan, Zhaokun Zhou, Jiakui Hu, Man Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient deep learning option due to their unique spike-based event-driven (i.e., spike-driven) paradigm. In this paper, we incorporate the spike-driven paradigm into Transformer by the proposed Spike-driven Transformer with four unique properties: 1) Event-driven, no calculation is triggered when the input of Transformer is zero; 2) Binary spike communication, all matrix multiplications associated with the spike matrix can be transformed into sparse additions; 3) Self-attention with linear complexity at both token and channel dimensions; 4) The operations between spike-form Query, Key, and Value are mask and addition. Together, there are only sparse addition operations in the Spike-driven Transformer. To this end, we design a novel Spike-Driven Self-Attention (SDSA), which exploits only mask and addition operations without any multiplication, and thus having up to $87.2\\times$ lower computation energy than vanilla self-attention. Especially in SDSA, the matrix multiplication between Query, Key, and Value is designed as the mask operation. In addition, we rearrange all residual connections in the vanilla Transformer before the activation functions to ensure that all neurons transmit binary spike signals. It is shown that the Spike-driven Transformer can achieve 77.1\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.

TorchSparse: Efficient Point Cloud Inference Engine\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization in attention*\n\n*Song Han, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization in attention*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Younes Belkada, Mike Lewis, Tim Dettmers*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have been widely adopted but require significant GPU memory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance. With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme, which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix multiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation. This result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible to use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs. We open-source our software.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

For example, the Routing Transformers mentioned in the analysis note use content-based sparse attention, which can be a starting point for developing event-driven mechanisms.\n\n### Vector Quantization\n- Vector Quantization (VQ) is a crucial component for reducing memory usage and computational requirements.

The rotation trick can help in preserving the relative angular distances and magnitudes in the gradient, improving codebook usage and reducing quantization error.\n\n### Adaptive Linear Attention\n- Adaptive linear attention mechanisms are key to reducing computational complexity. The work by Katharopoulos et al. on \"Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\" demonstrates how linear attention can be formulated as a recurrent operation, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length.\n- The concept of adaptive positional encodings, as discussed by Ke et al., can also enhance the model's ability to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training, which is crucial for adaptive attention mechanisms.\n\n### Meta-Learning\n- Meta-learning is essential for dynamic model adaptation. The work by Chen et al. on \"Meta-Learning for Dynamic Model Adaptation\" provides a framework for how models can learn to adapt quickly to new tasks, which can be applied to adjust event detection thresholds and attention weights based on the input context.\n\n### Integration and Benefits\n\n- **Event-Driven Linear Attention with Vector Quantization (EDLAVQ)**:\n  - Use an event detection module to identify important tokens.\n  - Apply linear attention mechanisms only to the detected events.\n  - Compress less important tokens using vector quantization.\n  - Implement a meta-learning module to dynamically adjust event detection thresholds and attention weights.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**:\n  - By focusing attention computation on significant events and compressing or skipping less important information, the model can achieve significant computational efficiency.\n  - Linear attention mechanisms enable handling longer sequences efficiently.\n  - Vector quantization reduces the memory footprint.\n\n- **Adaptability**:\n  - Meta-learning allows the model to adjust to new contexts and improve event detection over time.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**:\n  - Explore how sparse attention models like Routing Transformers manage computational resources and how their strategies can enhance the proposed design.\n\n- **Hierarchical Models**:\n  - Review architectures that use hierarchical processing to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Meta-Learning Techniques**:\n  - Study specific meta-learning algorithms suitable for adjusting attention mechanisms and event detection thresholds.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n1. **Katharopoulos et al.

Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/41 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nFor linear attention, we utilize the kernelization proposed by Katharopoulos et al. [38]. Additionally, we compare our methods to recent linear attention works that employ their own architectures rather than the GPT-2 architecture: GLA [77] and RetNet [67]. As the smallest GLA and RetNet is 340 M , We modify their hyperparameters to align with our setting. Detailed hyperparameters and results of other configurations can be found in Appendix C.1. We trained all models on the OpenWebText ${ }^{3}$ corpus for 10,000 steps, varying the context length. The results are presented in Table 1. Our SPARSEK+SW method consistently outperforms all previously\n\n[^2]established efficient attention methods. Particularly, SparseK+SW offers superior performance and has lower time complexity compared to previous learnable sparse attention methods, such as hash attention. Furthermore, linear attention methods, such as Linear+SW, GLA, and RetNet, demonstrate limitations, particularly in modeling long contexts. However, when combining linear attention with SPARSEK attention, we observed additional performance gains over SPARSEK+SW, even surpassing full attention. This suggests the potential of exploring a mixture of different attention methods for more efficient modeling. ### 4.2 Fine-tuning Existing Models\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-08.jpg?height=349&width=1354&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=381)\n\nFigure 2: Perplexity on the held-out set of fine-tuned models. L denotes the training context length. We replace the standard full attention in Pythia 160M, Pythia 410M [6] and TinyLlama 1.1B [80] with our SPARSEK attention and sliding window attention. The models are then fine-tuned over a few steps to ensure compatibility with the modified attention modules. Here we only consider sliding window attention because other efficient attention methods often require additional changes of the model architecture and sliding window attention is reported to be efficient in Chen et al. [11]. In fine-tuning, the NTK-aware interpolation [7] is adopted to extend the limit of pretrained positional encodings. For the Pythia models, we utilize a $1 \\%$ sampled subset of the SlimPajama dataset ${ }^{4}$ [63] to perform fine-tuning on moderate-length settings (i.e., 4 k and 8 k ). In contrast, we use an upsampled dataset comprising long documents [25] to fine-tune the TinyLlama models on long-length settings (i.e., 8 k and 16 k ). Training hyperparameters are listed in Appendix C.2. In Figure 2, we report the perplexity on the held-out set across various levels of sparsity and training context lengths. Extending the training context length and increasing the context size generally benefit all types of attention mechanisms. When matching the KV size, our SparseK+SW attention consistently outperforms sliding window attention. For the TinyLlama models, SparseK+SW attention achieves comparable perplexity using only half the KV size required by sliding window attention. These results underscore the advantages of a more adaptable context as implemented in SparseK+SW. We further evaluate TinyLlama 1.1B, fine-tuned with an 8 k context window, across additional tasks as presented in the following sections. ### 4.3 Retrieval-based Evaluation and Length Extrapolation\n\nA common concern with sparse attention is its potential to neglect informative history. To investigate this, we evaluated our fine-tuned models on the passkey retrieval task [47], along with two baseline methods that require no training: dynamic NTK [7, 23] and LM-Infinite [33]. The results are presented in Figure 3a. It is evident that the sliding window approach fails even within the trained context length. Furthermore, among the training-free methods, NTK utilizes full attention and extends the context length by a factor of four, whereas the memory-efficient method LM-Infinite fails in extrapolation. In contrast, SPARSEK+SW is memory-efficient while maintaining performance for context lengths well beyond four times longer. We also analyze the perplexity of tokens in various positional buckets within a long context, as depicted in Figure 3b. In the language modeling task, SW demonstrates the ability to effectively manage contexts four times longer than standard models, although it is less competitive in relatively short contexts. While SPARSEK+SW fails at contexts extending to 26 k tokens, it outperforms both NTK and fine-tuned full attention models.

The choice of language is based on the fact that the training corpus of TinyLlama is primarily in English. We test all models using greedy decoding, with the evaluation context size set to 8192 . All results are presented in Table 2. Full attention offers the best performance but incurs the highest memory cost. Sliding window attention is memory-efficient; however, it results in significant performance degradation. In contrast, our SPARSEK+SW attention not only demonstrates strong performance but also achieves high memory efficiency. Notably, SPARSEK+SW outperforms the training-free method, NTK, and the inference-time KV cache compression method, H2O [81]. This suggests the benefits of maintaining consistency between training and inference. However, SparseK+SW underperforms fine-tuned full attention, representing a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Table 2: Results on LongBench. * denotes that the method is training-free. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ We use 512 globel (heavy-hitter) KV cache and 512 local KV cache in H2O. | Model | Single-Doc QA |  |  | Multi-Doc QA |  |  | Summarziation |  |  | Few-shot Learning |  |  | Synthetic |  | Code |  | Avg. |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| NTK $^{*}$ <br> $w=8192$ | 4.34 | 10.30 | 14.54 | 6.49 | 9.19 | 3.49 | 11.77 | 7.84 | 3.62 | 49.5 | 55.17 | 22.66 | 1.21 | 3.38 | 52.19 | 48.90 | 19.04 |\n| Full <br> $w=8192$ | 3.95 | 13.07 | 13.16 | 6.81 | 10.77 | 3.51 | 15.17 | 6.12 | 8.30 | 61.00 | 65.15 | 26.02 | 0.39 | 2.37 | 56.72 | 50.36 | 21.42 |\n| SW <br> $w=1024$ | 1.34 | 8.69 | 5.41 | 2.76 | 4.46 | 0.48 | 11.78 | 4.25 | 2.39 | 25.50 | 13.43 | 5.33 | 2.3 | 0.50 | 52.22 | 27.50 | 10.52 |\n| SparseK+SW <br> $k=w=512$ | 5.19 | 14.29 | 13.24 | 6.85 | 9.21 | 3.83 | 14.11 | 5.97 | 5.85 | 55.00 | 52.06 | 24.79 | 0.61 | 2.61 | 53.90 | 50.89 | 19.90 |\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe propose SpArSEK attention, a new approach to sparse attention that achieves both computational and memory efficiency. Within self-attention, we use an additional scoring network evaluating the importance of each key-value pair and select the top- $k$ pairs. We propose the differentiable SPARSEK operator, a relaxation of TOPK, to enable gradient-based optimization. Experiments on language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate consistent improvements compared to previous efficient attention methods. ## References\n\n[1] Joshua Ainslie, Tao Lei, Michiel de Jong, Santiago Ontan'on, Siddhartha Brahma, Yury Zemlyanskiy, David C.

Each model is trained with 1M tokens batches. Vanilla softmax attention goes out-of-memory (OOM) for context lengths $>8 \\mathrm{k}$. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017) are stateof-the-art for many natural language tasks, leading to breakthroughs in machine translation, language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019), and language modeling (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023). However, the quadratic time and space complexity of the attention mechanism limits scalability for long context lengths. Numerous \"efficient transformers\" have been proposed to address this issue (Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Han et al., 2023). These variants approximate ${ }^{2}$ the standard attention mechanism. A survey by Tay et al. (2022) provides a broad overview of these techniques. While many efficient transformer constructions achieve linear theoretical training complexity, the survey observes that practical training speedups are often less significant, with potential losses in model quality. This explains the continued dominance of vanilla transformers. In this work, we focus on improving training latency for transformer models in decoding-only tasks, specifically language modeling trained via next-word prediction. Our techniques are generalizable to encoding-only and encoderdecoder transformers, with potential applications beyond language modeling. We will first briefly discuss existing approaches to make training of transformer models faster and then place our contributions in context. [^1]Memory efficient and I/O aware approach. Recent work by (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) on FlashAttention and FlashAttention-2 seeks to enable vanilla transformer training on long contexts. This is achieved through I/O-aware optimizations like blocking/tiling and rematerialization, significantly improving memory efficiency. While this reduces the $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)^{3}$ HBM (High-Bandwidth Memory) requirements of accelerators (GPUs/TPUs), enabling training on thousands of tokens, the computational cost per step remains $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ (see Figure 1), and this remains a barrier to further scaling the context length. Approximate softmax attention via sparsification. Another line of work tries to approximate softmax attention and avoid $n \\times n$ attention matrix computation by focusing on a smaller set of pairs of query and key vectors. Techniques include utilizing locality/positional information (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2023), hashing/bucketing (Kitaev et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Han et al., 2023), low-rank projection (Wang et al., 2020), or other sparsification methods. In these cases, there is usually some trade-off between model quality and sparsity, i.e., denser attentions improve quality but decrease speed. Hence, an efficient high-quality $n \\times n$ attention mechanism may potentially improve on these sparsification-based techniques. Efficient $n \\times n$ attention by kernel-based methods. The kernel-based view of attention was taken by a series of earlier works (Tsai et al., 2019; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). In particular, let $\\left\\{\\mathbf{q}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]}$ be sets of query, key and value vectors respectively, the output of the attention mechanism for query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ is computed as $\\operatorname{Attn}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\right\\}\\right)=\\sum_{j \\in[n]} \\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[n]} \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}$. When the similarity kernel function $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}):=\\exp (\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle)$, the above attention is exactly the softmax attention ${ }^{4}$. If there exists a feature map $\\phi$ such that $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) \\equiv\\langle\\phi(\\mathbf{x}), \\phi(\\mathbf{y})\\rangle$, the attention output for query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Attn}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\right\\}\\right) & =\\sum_{j \\in[n]} \\frac{\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[n]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\sum_{j \\in[n]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}}{\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[n]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $\\phi(\\cdot)$ has a finite dimension $h^{\\prime}$, one can first compute $\\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[n]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)$ and $\\sum_{j \\in[n]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}$ in $O\\left(n h h^{\\prime}\\right)$ time, and then compute $\\operatorname{Attn}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\right\\}\\right)$ for all $i \\in[n]$ in another $O\\left(n h h^{\\prime}\\right)$ time, which is linear in the context length $n$. Most of existing works such as (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Bolya et al., 2022; Tsai et al., 2019; Babiloni et al., 2023;\n\n[^2]Yang et al., 2023; Kasai et al., 2021) only considers similarity functions $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$ with low dimensional feature mapping (e.g., $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})=\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle,\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle^{2},\\langle\\mathrm{elu}(\\mathrm{x})+\\mathbf{1}, \\mathrm{elu}(\\mathbf{y})+\\mathbf{1}\\rangle$, etc.). Hua et al. (2022) proposed to use a mixed strategy based on the positions of the tokens: If positions $i, j \\in[n]$ are close enough, they use $\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)=\\operatorname{relu}^{2}\\left(\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle\\right)$. Otherwise, they use $\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle$, which again has a low dimensional feature mapping. These simple similarity kernel functions $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ either suffer from some loss of model quality (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) or require additional tweaks of network structures (e.g., significantly increasing the number of attention layers (Hua et al., 2022), introducing decay factors for earlier tokens (Yang et al., 2023)) to achieve comparable model quality as softmax attention. Some other previous works try to approximate the regular softmax attention via approximate feature mappings for the exponential similarity function. Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021) uses random Fourier features to produce an approximate feature mapping but without provable approximation guarantees. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) provides a low dimensional approximate non-negative feature mapping $\\phi^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ via positive orthogonal random features. It has provable approximation to the pairwise similarities, i.e., the maximum error $\\max _{i, j \\in[n]}\\left|\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right), \\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle-\\exp \\left(\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle\\right)\\right|$ is small. However, the dimension of their feature mapping has to grow exponentially in $\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}$ and $\\left\\|\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}$ to have a small error. In other words, consider a single query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ and two keys $\\mathbf{k}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}$ such that all $\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right\\|_{2},\\left\\|\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\|_{2},\\left\\|\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq R$, then $\\exp \\left(\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle\\right) / \\exp \\left(\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\rangle\\right) \\leq \\exp \\left(2 R^{2}\\right)$. Thus, the maximum relative probability masses that can be assigned while guaranteeing the approximation factor is limited by the dimension of the feature mapping used. In fact, a recent work (Alman \\& Song, 2023) implies that it is actually impossible to get above approximation for pairwise exponential similarity under Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH (Impagliazzo et al., 2001)) when the query and key vectors have large entries. Furthermore, it was observed empirically (Choromanski et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2022) (also see Figure 2) that there is a clear model quality drop in comparison with the exact softmax attention. Given barriers above, a natural question arises: Does there exist a similarity kernel function that achieves similar model quality as softmax attention while also admitting proper approximation by a low-dimensional feature mapping? ### 1.1. Our Contributions\n\nPolynomial similarity kernel function of high degree. To tackle the first part of the above question, we explore the power of the polynomial kernel function $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})=\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle^{p}$ for large even degrees $p \\geq 4$ empirically for language modelling tasks. In particular, we look at the standard GPT-\n2 (Radford et al., 2019) architecture (from the small size to the large size) and the strongest known Transformer recipe (a.k.a. Transformer++) which is a common baseline model studied in many previous works as well (Hua et al., 2022; Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). We compare the models with vanilla softmax attention to the models that simply replace the attention mechanism with degree- $p$ polynomial attention. We consider context lengths ranging from 512 to 32k. As shown in Figure 2 and our other empirical studies (see Section 4 and Appendix), for all synthetic tasks (including tasks for measuring content aware reasoning and memorization capabilities, see Appendix F), autoregressive pre-training metrics (perplexity) and few-shot evaluations that we studied, the models with degree- $p$ polynomial attention $(p \\geq 4)$ achieve comparable performance as the models with the vanilla softmax attention. In addition, we discuss the behavioral similarities between softmax attention and polynomial attention in Section 2.1 to provide more intuitions why they had similar empirical outcomes. Approximate feature mapping for polynomial kernel. Unlike exponential kernel whose exact feature mapping has infinite dimension, the feature mapping of degree- $p$ polynomial kernel over $\\mathbb{R}^{h}$ has a finite feature mapping of dimension $h^{p}$ (see e.g., (Avron et al., 2014)). In practice, the head size $h$ is usually 64,128 or even 256 (Chowdhery et al., 2023). Therefore, computing the exact feature mapping for $p \\geq 4$ is still expensive. To address this issue, we apply the sketching technique from the numerical linear algebra literature to compute a low-dimensional approximate feature mapping $\\phi^{\\prime}$ such that $\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x}), \\phi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\rangle \\approx\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle^{p}$. Sketching polynomial kernels (Avron et al., 2014; Ahle et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021; Meister et al., 2019) has been extensively studied in the literature, and the techniques are used in many applications such as kernel regression (Song et al., 2021), kernel PCA (Avron et al., 2014), evaluating elementwise matrix functions (Han et al., 2020), and etc. However, though $\\langle\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\rangle^{p}$ is guaranteed to be non-negative for even integer $p$, none of the approximate feature mappings provided by previous work guarantees $\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x}), \\phi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\rangle \\geq 0$. This is undesired in practice since the original normalized attention weights $\\frac{\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{1}\\right\\rangle^{p}}{\\sum_{j \\in[n]}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle^{p}}, \\frac{\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{2}\\right\\rangle^{p}}{\\sum_{j \\in[n]}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle^{p}}, \\cdots, \\frac{\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{n}\\right\\rangle^{p}}{\\sum_{j \\in[n]}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle^{p}}$ naturally represent a probability distribution, but the property does not hold when there exists some negative attention weight $\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right), \\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle$. More importantly, previous work (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020) found that negative attention weights make the training process unstable, potentially causing non-convergence. To address this issue, we open the construction of (Ahle et al., 2020) and develop an approximate feature mapping with desired non-negativity property. Theorem 1.1. Let $p \\geq 2$ be an even integer, $\\varepsilon \\in(0,0.5)$ be an error parameter. Let $h$ be the dimension of the vectors to be mapped. There is a randomized feature mapping $\\phi^{\\prime}$ : $\\mathbb{R}^{h} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{r^{2}}$ for $r=\\Theta\\left(p \\varepsilon^{-2} \\log 1 / \\delta\\right)$, such that given any set of vectors $\\left\\{\\mathbf{q}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]}$ :\n\n1. $\\forall i, j \\in[n],\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right), \\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle \\geq 0$. 2. $\\sum_{i, j}\\left|\\left\\langle\\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right), \\phi^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle-\\left\\langle\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\rangle^{p}\\right|^{2} \\leq \\varepsilon^{2} \\sum_{i, j}\\left\\|\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right\\|_{2}^{2 p}\\left\\|\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}^{2 p}$ holds with probability $1-\\delta$. 3. Computing $\\phi^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x})$ only requires $p / 2$ matrix-vector multiplications of matrix size $h \\times r,(p / 2-2)$ matrixvector multiplications of matrix size $r \\times r,(p / 2-1)$ Hadamard products of $r$-dimensional vectors, and 1 self-Kronecker product of an r-dimensional vector. The first property above is the desired non-negativity property that we discussed earlier. We achieve this property by providing a \"self-tensoring\" technique stated in Theorem 2.4. The second property states our error bound. Unlike the approximation guarantee of (Choromanski et al., 2020), though our error bound is still in terms of $\\ell_{2}$ norms query and key vectors, it allows a larger ratio between attention weights due to the difference between exponential kernel and polynomial kernel (See more discussions in Appendix B). The third property implies that the computation of $\\phi^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ only requires a small number of standard matrix/vector operations which can be implemented to run quickly on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs). Inspired by the literature of learned sketches (Hsu et al., 2019; Aamand et al., 2019), we also propose a heuristic which replaces each random projection matrix used in $\\phi^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ constructed in Theorem 1.1 with a comparable size learnable multi-layer dense network. Since each random matrix used in $\\phi^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ has size only $h \\times r$ or $r \\times r$, the number of parameters that we add to the model is negligible in comparison with the model size. We observe significant model quality improvements (see Figure 2) by learning the sketches through training instead of using randomly sampled sketches. Block-based lower triangular multiplication for handling causal masks. Another bottleneck in applying attention linearization techniques in training transformer models with causal masking on long contexts is to handle a huge number of sequential gradients update due to RNN-style sequential state updates (Hua et al., 2022). When causal masking is applied, the attention between the query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ and the key $\\mathbf{k}_{j}$ is masked out when $j>i$ (i.e., the $j$-th token appears later). More precisely, $\\operatorname{Attn}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\right\\}\\right)=$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in[i]} \\frac{\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right)}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[i]} \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\sum_{j \\in[i]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}}{\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\cdot \\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[i]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nDuring the training, to compute the output of the attention mechanism in time linear in context length, one has to compute the prefix sums $\\sum_{j \\in[i]} \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{j}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j}^{\\top}$ for all $i$ and then multiply the $i$-th prefix sum with the corresponding vector\n$\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top}$. This RNN-style sequential state updates make the training process fail in fully utilizing the parallelism strength of modern accelerators. To resolve above issue, we propose a general block-based approach to compute $\\mathrm{It}_{\\triangle}\\left(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{C}^{5}$ for arbitrary matrices $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}$ without materializing $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}^{\\top}$, and it only requires a small number of prefix updates. By working more carefully with our block-based approach, we observe that instead of using the approximate polynomial attention weight via approximate feature mapping, we are able to compute the exact polynomial attention weight between $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{j}$ if the $i$-th token and the $j$-th token are close in position. After applying exact polynomial attention weight for local tokens, we see improvements in model qualities (see Figure 2, Section 4 and other empirical results in Appendix). Empirical studies. We empirically evaluate all our approaches. The models equipped with high degree polynomial attention and sketched polynomial attention achieve comparable or better quality on all our evaluation metrics in comparison with models equipped with vanilla softmax attention, and achieve significantly better quality than models with approximate softmax attention provided by Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020). For GPT-2 style small size models, the models with sketched polynomial attention achieve 2x speedup in comparison with FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) of the fastest configuration for 32k context length.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 17 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: sparse attention mechanisms transformer, hierarchical language models, meta-learning in attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms transformer*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

Sinop*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.

Efficient Hierarchical Domain Adaptation for Pretrained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical language models*\n\n*Alexandra Chronopoulou, Matthew E. Peters, Jesse Dodge*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a method to permit domain adaptation to many diverse domains using a computationally efficient adapter approach based on the observation that textual domains are partially overlapping, and represents domains as a hierarchical tree structure where each node in the tree is associated with a set of adapter weights.\n\n**Abstract:** The remarkable success of large language models has been driven by dense models trained on massive unlabeled, unstructured corpora. These corpora typically contain text from diverse, heterogeneous sources, but information about the source of the text is rarely used during training. Transferring their knowledge to a target domain is typically done by continuing training in-domain. In this paper, we introduce a method to permit domain adaptation to many diverse domains using a computationally efficient adapter approach. Our method is based on the observation that textual domains are partially overlapping, and we represent domains as a hierarchical tree structure where each node in the tree is associated with a set of adapter weights. When combined with a frozen pretrained language model, this approach enables parameter sharing among related domains, while avoiding negative interference between unrelated ones. Experimental results with GPT-2 and a large fraction of the 100 most represented websites in C4 show across-the-board improvements in-domain. We additionally provide an inference time algorithm for a held-out domain and show that averaging over multiple paths through the tree enables further gains in generalization, while adding only a marginal cost to inference.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Large Language Models are Complex Table Parsers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical language models*\n\n*Bowen Zhao, Changkai Ji, Yuejie Zhang, Wen He, Yingwen Wang, Qing Wang, Rui Feng, Xiaobo Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper enhances the prompt template with an explanatory description of the meaning of each tuple and the logical reasoning process of the task, which effectively improves the hierarchical structure awareness capability of GPT-3.5 to better parse the complex tables.\n\n**Abstract:** With the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5) exhibiting remarkable reasoning and comprehension abilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), most Question Answering (QA) research has primarily centered around general QA tasks based on GPT, neglecting the specific challenges posed by Complex Table QA. In this paper, we propose to incorporate GPT-3.5 to address such challenges, in which complex tables are reconstructed into tuples and specific prompt designs are employed for dialogues. Specifically, we encode each cell's hierarchical structure, position information, and content as a tuple. By enhancing the prompt template with an explanatory description of the meaning of each tuple and the logical reasoning process of the task, we effectively improve the hierarchical structure awareness capability of GPT-3.5 to better parse the complex tables.

Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. One Meta-tuned Transformer is What You Need for Few-shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in attention mechanisms*\n\n*Xuehan Yang, Huaxiu Yao, Ying Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, is designed, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision transformers have revolutionized few-shot image classification, and it has been recently demonstrated that the previous common practice of meta-learning in synergy with these pre-trained transformers still holds significance. In this work, we design a new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance. Leveraging the intrinsical property of ViTs in handling local patch relationships, we propose Masked Sample Attention (MSA) to efficiently embed the sample relationships into the network, where an adaptive mask is attached for enhancing task-specific feature consistency and providing flexibility in switching between few-shot learning setups. To encapsulate task relationships while filtering out background noise, Patch-grained Task Attention (PTA) is designed to maintain a dynamic knowledge pool consolidating diverse patterns from historical tasks. MetaFormer demonstrates coherence and compatibility with off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers and shows significant improvements in both inductive and transductive few-shot learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 8 . 77% and 6 . 25% on 12 in-domain and 10 cross-domain datasets, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Fast and Slow Learning of Recurrent Independent Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in attention mechanisms*\n\n*Kanika Madan, Rosemary Nan Ke, Anirudh Goyal, B. Scholkopf, Y. Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that meta-learning the modular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster adaptation in a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a partially observed grid world with image-level input and reversing the role of parameters and meta-parameters does not work nearly as well, suggesting a particular role for fast adaptation of the dynamically selected modules.\n\n**Abstract:** Decomposing knowledge into interchangeable pieces promises a generalization advantage when there are changes in distribution. A learning agent interacting with its environment is likely to be faced with situations requiring novel combinations of existing pieces of knowledge. We hypothesize that such a decomposition of knowledge is particularly relevant for being able to generalize in a systematic manner to out-of-distribution changes. To study these ideas, we propose a particular training framework in which we assume that the pieces of knowledge an agent needs and its reward function are stationary and can be re-used across tasks. An attention mechanism dynamically selects which modules can be adapted to the current task, and the parameters of the selected modules are allowed to change quickly as the learner is confronted with variations in what it experiences, while the parameters of the attention mechanisms act as stable, slowly changing, meta-parameters. We focus on pieces of knowledge captured by an ensemble of modules sparsely communicating with each other via a bottleneck of attention. We find that meta-learning the modular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster adaptation in a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a partially observed grid world with image-level input. We also find that reversing the role of parameters and meta-parameters does not work nearly as well, suggesting a particular role for fast adaptation of the dynamically selected modules.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Memory Efficient Neural Processes via Constant Memory Attention Block\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in attention mechanisms*\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Y. Bengio, M. O. Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Modelling Suspense in Short Stories as Uncertainty Reduction over Neural\n  Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical language models*\n\n*David Wilmot, Frank Keller*\n\n**Abstract:** Suspense is a crucial ingredient of narrative fiction, engaging readers and\nmaking stories compelling. While there is a vast theoretical literature on\nsuspense, it is computationally not well understood. We compare two ways for\nmodelling suspense: surprise, a backward-looking measure of how unexpected the\ncurrent state is given the story so far; and uncertainty reduction, a\nforward-looking measure of how unexpected the continuation of the story is.\nBoth can be computed either directly over story representations or over their\nprobability distributions. We propose a hierarchical language model that\nencodes stories and computes surprise and uncertainty reduction. Evaluating\nagainst short stories annotated with human suspense judgements, we find that\nuncertainty reduction over representations is the best predictor, resulting in\nnear-human accuracy. We also show that uncertainty reduction can be used to\npredict suspenseful events in movie synopses.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-30T16:03:06Z  (*Updated: 2020-04-30T16:03:06Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. PS-Transformer: Learning Sparse Photometric Stereo Network using Self-Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms transformer*\n\n*Satoshi Ikehata*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing deep calibrated photometric stereo networks basically aggregate observations under different lights based on the pre-defined operations such as linear projection and max pooling. While they are effective with the dense capture, simple first-order operations often fail to capture the high-order interactions among observations under small number of different lights. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a deep sparse calibrated photometric stereo network named {\\it PS-Transformer} which leverages the learnable self-attention mechanism to properly capture the complex inter-image interactions. PS-Transformer builds upon the dual-branch design to explore both pixel-wise and image-wise features and individual feature is trained with the intermediate surface normal supervision to maximize geometric feasibility. A new synthetic dataset named CyclesPS+ is also presented with the comprehensive analysis to successfully train the photometric stereo networks. Extensive results on the publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the surface normal prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with the same number of input images and is even comparable to that of dense algorithms which input 10$\\times$ larger number of images.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms transformer*\n\n*Anirudh Ravula, Santiago Ontanon, Manzil Zaheer, Chris Alberti, Avinava Dubey, Philip Pham, Joshua Ainslie, Amr Ahmed, Qifan Wang, Li Yang, Guru Guruganesh*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical language models*\n\n*Henryk Michalewski, Christian Szegedy, Yuhuai Wu, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Szymon Tworkowski, Piotr Nawrot*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-transformers-are-more-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Prompting Assists Large Language Model on Web Navigation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical language models*\n\n*Shuyan Zhou, Hao Zhu, Frank F. Xu, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) struggle on processing complicated observations in interactive decision making tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple hierarchical prompting approach. Diverging from previous prompting approaches that always put the full observation (e.g. a web page) to the prompt, we propose to first construct an action-aware observation which is more condensed and relevant with a dedicated SUMMARIZER prompt. The ACTOR prompt then predicts the next action based on the summarized observation. While our method has broad applicability, we particularly demonstrate its efficacy in the complex domain of web navigation where a full observation often contains redundant and irrelevant information. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art prompting mechanics by 6.2% on task success rate, demonstrating its potential on interactive decision making tasks with long observation traces.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 5. Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chuan Shi, Xiao Wang, Yanfang Ye, Peng Cui, P. Yu, Houye Ji, Bai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.\n\n**Conference:** heterogeneous-graph-attention-network-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 6. Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Implicitly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in attention mechanisms*\n\n*Zhifang Sui, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei, Yaru Hao, Li Dong, Yutao Sun, Damai Dai*\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained language models have shown surprising in-context learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, its working mechanism still remains an open question. In this paper, we explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand in-context learning as implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. We comprehensively compare the behaviors of in-context learning and explicit finetuning on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. Experimental results show that in-context learning behaves similarly to explicit finetuning from multiple perspectives. Inspired by the dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with gradient descent with momentum. The improved performance over vanilla attention further supports our understanding from another perspective, and more importantly, shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model design.

The **Sparse Focus Transformer (SFT)** described in uses a sparse attention mechanism to locate and capture changing regions in images, which can be adapted for text-based tasks. This approach reduces the parameter count and computational complexity.\n- **Differential Transformer** introduced in,, and uses a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. This method cancels out noise and promotes sparse attention patterns, which is beneficial for focusing on relevant context and mitigating hallucinations.\n\n## Hierarchical Language Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss hierarchical language models, the idea of hierarchical structures can be inferred from models that use multiple layers or modules to handle different aspects of the input. For example, the **SFT** in uses a combination of CNN, sparse focus attention, and a description decoder, which can be seen as a hierarchical approach.\n- To explore hierarchical models further, researching architectures like the **Transformer-XL** or **Longformer**, which are designed to handle long sequences efficiently, could be beneficial.\n\n## Meta-Learning in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Meta-learning** can be integrated into transformers to enable dynamic adaptation. The concept of transformers as meta-learners is discussed in, where it is shown that transformers can perform meta-learning by adjusting representations dynamically through self-attention mechanisms.\n- **Memory-Based Meta-Learning** on non-stationary distributions, as mentioned in the analysis, can help the model adapt to new contexts and input distributions, enhancing performance on varied inputs.\n\n## Integration Strategy\n\n### Event-Driven Sparse Attention\n\n- The idea of **event-driven processing** can be adapted from spiking neural networks like **SpikeGPT**, where only significant tokens incur computational overhead. This can be combined with sparse attention mechanisms to focus on relevant tokens.\n\n### Vector Quantization\n\n- **Vector Quantization (VQ)** can be used to compress token representations, reducing memory and computational overhead. This is demonstrated in **Transformer-VQ** and **CLaM-TTS**.\n\n### Adaptive Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Linear attention mechanisms** can be made efficient through techniques like those described in **When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding** and **CHELA**. These approaches ensure compatibility with speculative decoding and offer hardware-efficient implementations.\n\n### Meta-Learning Module\n\n- Integrating **meta-learning** can help the model adjust to new contexts dynamically. This can be achieved by using memory-based meta-learning or transformers as meta-learners to adapt attention weights and event detection thresholds based on input distributions.\n\n## Key Insights and References\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: This architecture is particularly promising as it addresses the issue of noise in attention mechanisms and promotes sparse attention patterns, which is crucial for focusing on relevant context.\n- **Sparse Focus Transformer**: This model demonstrates how sparse attention can be integrated into a transformer architecture to reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: The design of hardware accelerators for sparse transformer models, as discussed in, highlights the potential for optimizing performance, energy efficiency, and scalability.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Study Hardware-Efficient Sparse Attention Implementations**: Investigate how models like Spike-driven Transformers implement event-driven sparse attention efficiently and explore the potential of neuromorphic hardware.\n- **Examine Hierarchical and Memory-Augmented Models**: Research models that use hierarchical structures or external memory to handle long sequences and maintain relevant information.\n- **Deep Dive into Meta-Learning Algorithms**: Investigate specific meta-learning algorithms suitable for adjusting attention mechanisms and assess how these algorithms can be integrated into transformers without incurring significant computational overhead.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researcher can design a GAU that leverages event-driven sparse attention, vector quantization, adaptive linear attention mechanisms, and meta-learning to achieve low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and excellent scalability.\n\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nVol. 34. 2020.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials.

We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.76)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models.

Spikformer: When Spiking Neural Network Meets Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven sparse attention*\n\n*Zhaokun Zhou, Yuesheng Zhu, Chao He, Yaowei Wang, Shuicheng Yan, Yonghong Tian, Liuliang Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel Spiking Self Attention (SSA) as well as a powerful framework, named Spiking Transformer (Spikformer), and shows that Spikformer with SSA can outperform the state-of-the-art SNNs-like frameworks in image classification on both neuromorphic and static datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider two biologically plausible structures, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) and the self-attention mechanism. The former offers an energy-efficient and event-driven paradigm for deep learning, while the latter has the ability to capture feature dependencies, enabling Transformer to achieve good performance. It is intuitively promising to explore the marriage between them. In this paper, we consider leveraging both self-attention capability and biological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self Attention (SSA) as well as a powerful framework, named Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism in Spikformer models the sparse visual feature by using spike-form Query, Key, and Value without softmax. Since its computation is sparse and avoids multiplication, SSA is efficient and has low computational energy consumption. It is shown that Spikformer with SSA can outperform the state-of-the-art SNNs-like frameworks in image classification on both neuromorphic and static datasets. Spikformer (66.3M parameters) with comparable size to SEW-ResNet-152 (60.2M,69.26%) can achieve 74.81% top1 accuracy on ImageNet using 4 time steps, which is the state-of-the-art in directly trained SNNs models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 159  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 2. Interpretable Relevant Emotion Ranking with Event-Driven Attention\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven sparse attention*\n\n*Yang Yang, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He, Meng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel interpretable relevant emotion ranking model with the event information incorporated into a deep learning architecture using the event-driven attentions is proposed and interpretable results can be obtained to shed light on the events which trigger certain emotions.\n\n**Abstract:** Multiple emotions with different intensities are often evoked by events described in documents. Oftentimes, such event information is hidden and needs to be discovered from texts. Unveiling the hidden event information can help to understand how the emotions are evoked and provide explainable results. However, existing studies often ignore the latent event information. In this paper, we proposed a novel interpretable relevant emotion ranking model with the event information incorporated into a deep learning architecture using the event-driven attentions. Moreover, corpus-level event embeddings and document-level event distributions are introduced respectively to consider the global events in corpus and the document-specific events simultaneously. Experimental results on three real-world corpora show that the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the state-of-the-art emotion detection approaches and multi-label approaches. Moreover, interpretable results can be obtained to shed light on the events which trigger certain emotions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. A Meta-Learning Perspective on Transformers for Causal Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in transformers*\n\n*Xinbo Wu, L.

However, mechanisms to explain its capabilities are not well understood. Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process within the Transformer. Further, within the inner optimization, we discover and theoretically analyze a special characteristic of the norms of learned token representations within Transformer-based causal language models.

Veness*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that various types of memory-based neural models can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based meta-learning is a technique for approximating Bayes-optimal predictors. Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error, measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments. We show that various types of memory-based neural models, including Transformers, LSTMs, and RNNs can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in transformers*\n\n*L. Melo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture and shows that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture and variants presented remarkable success across many machine learning tasks in recent years. This success is intrinsically related to the capability of handling long sequences and the presence of context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism. We argue that these capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. One Step of Gradient Descent is Provably the Optimal In-Context Learner with One Layer of Linear Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention vector quantization*\n\n*Arvind V. Mahankali, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Tengyu Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work theoretically study transformers with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data and mathematically shows that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the pre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares linear regression objective.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have empirically analyzed in-context learning and shown that transformers trained on synthetic linear regression tasks can learn to implement ridge regression, which is the Bayes-optimal predictor, given sufficient capacity [Aky\\\"urek et al., 2023], while one-layer transformers with linear self-attention and no MLP layer will learn to implement one step of gradient descent (GD) on a least-squares linear regression objective [von Oswald et al., 2022]. However, the theory behind these observations remains poorly understood. We theoretically study transformers with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. First, we mathematically show that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the pre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares linear regression objective. Then, we find that changing the distribution of the covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has a strong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of the pre-training loss now implements a single step of $\\textit{pre-conditioned}$ GD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then this does not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the response comes from a more general family of $\\textit{nonlinear}$ functions, the global minimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on a least-squares linear regression objective.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7. GradiVeQ: Vector Quantization for Bandwidth-Efficient Gradient Aggregation in Distributed CNN Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention vector quantization*\n\n*Mingchao Yu, Zhifeng Lin, Krishnagiri Narra, Songze Li, Youjie Li, N. Kim, A. Schwing, M. Annavaram, A. Avestimehr*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper empirically demonstrate the strong linear correlations between CNN gradients, and proposes a gradient vector quantization technique, named GradiVeQ, to exploit these correlations through principal component analysis (PCA) for substantial gradient dimension reduction.\n\n**Abstract:** Data parallelism can boost the training speed of convolutional neural networks (CNN), but could suffer from significant communication costs caused by gradient aggregation. To alleviate this problem, several scalar quantization techniques have been developed to compress the gradients. But these techniques could perform poorly when used together with decentralized aggregation protocols like ring all-reduce (RAR), mainly due to their inability to directly aggregate compressed gradients. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the strong linear correlations between CNN gradients, and propose a gradient vector quantization technique, named GradiVeQ, to exploit these correlations through principal component analysis (PCA) for substantial gradient dimension reduction. GradiVeQ enables direct aggregation of compressed gradients, hence allows us to build a distributed learning system that parallelizes GradiVeQ gradient compression and RAR communications. Extensive experiments on popular CNNs demonstrate that applying GradiVeQ slashes the wall-clock gradient aggregation time of the original RAR by more than 5X without noticeable accuracy loss, and reduces the end-to-end training time by almost 50%. The results also show that GradiVeQ is compatible with scalar quantization techniques such as QSGD (Quantized SGD), and achieves a much higher speed-up gain under the same compression ratio.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven sparse attention*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Spike-driven Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: event-driven sparse attention*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Bo Xu, Yonghong Tian, Li Yuan, Zhaokun Zhou, Jiakui Hu, Man Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient deep learning option due to their unique spike-based event-driven (i.e., spike-driven) paradigm. In this paper, we incorporate the spike-driven paradigm into Transformer by the proposed Spike-driven Transformer with four unique properties: 1) Event-driven, no calculation is triggered when the input of Transformer is zero; 2) Binary spike communication, all matrix multiplications associated with the spike matrix can be transformed into sparse additions; 3) Self-attention with linear complexity at both token and channel dimensions; 4) The operations between spike-form Query, Key, and Value are mask and addition. Together, there are only sparse addition operations in the Spike-driven Transformer. To this end, we design a novel Spike-Driven Self-Attention (SDSA), which exploits only mask and addition operations without any multiplication, and thus having up to $87.2\\times$ lower computation energy than vanilla self-attention. Especially in SDSA, the matrix multiplication between Query, Key, and Value is designed as the mask operation. In addition, we rearrange all residual connections in the vanilla Transformer before the activation functions to ensure that all neurons transmit binary spike signals. It is shown that the Spike-driven Transformer can achieve 77.1\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.

Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning in transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

Linear-Time Self Attention with Codeword Histogram for Efficient Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention vector quantization*\n\n*Hongxia Yang, Jingren Zhou, Mingyang Yin, Lu Yin, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Defu Lian, Yongji Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has become increasingly popular in a variety of sequence modeling tasks from natural language processing to recommendation, due to its effectiveness. However, self-attention suffers from quadratic computational and memory complexities, prohibiting its applications on long sequences. Existing approaches that address this issue mainly rely on a sparse attention context, either using a local window, or a permuted bucket obtained by locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or sorting, while crucial information may be lost. Inspired by the idea of vector quantization that uses cluster centroids to approximate items, we propose LISA (LInear-time Self Attention), which enjoys both the effectiveness of vanilla self-attention and the efficiency of sparse attention. LISA scales linearly with the sequence length, while enabling full contextual attention via computing differentiable histograms of codeword distributions. Meanwhile, unlike some efficient attention methods, our method poses no restriction on casual masking or sequence length. We evaluate our method on four real-world datasets for sequential recommendation. The results show that LISA outperforms the state-of-the-art efficient attention methods in both performance and speed; and it is up to 57x faster and 78x more memory efficient than vanilla self-attention.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 6.

For instance, **content-based sparse attention** as described in can be highly effective. This approach, used in Routing Transformers, routes information based on content, which aligns well with event-driven processing.\n- **Selective State Spaces** as introduced in Mamba can be integrated to enable content-based reasoning in linear time, which is crucial for focusing on significant tokens (events) efficiently.\n\n## Vector Quantization\n\n- **Vector Quantization (VQ)** can be used to compress representations of less important tokens, reducing memory usage and computational overhead. The integration of VQ within attention mechanisms, as suggested by the use of linearization techniques, can be particularly beneficial.\n- The idea of using VQ to reduce memory and computational demands is supported by the efficiency gains seen in sparse sequence-to-sequence models.\n\n## Adaptive Linear Attention\n\n- **Adaptive Linear Attention** can be achieved through techniques like those described in SPADE, which augments Transformers with State Space Models (SSMs) to capture global information efficiently.\n- The work on **linear attention with constant cost per token** provides a method to apply attention mechanisms with constant time and space complexity, which is essential for scalability.\n\n## Meta-Learning\n\n- **Meta-Learning** can be integrated to dynamically adjust model parameters based on input context. The concept of meta-learning modular aspects of the model, as discussed in, can facilitate faster adaptation and improve the model's robustness.\n- The duality between Transformers and SSMs provides a theoretical foundation for incorporating meta-learning within the proposed architecture.\n\n## Integration and Efficiency\n\n- The **Sparse Transformer** architecture, as described in, reduces complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n\\sqrt{n})\\) by applying sparse factorizations to self-attention matrices. This can be a cornerstone for integrating event-driven sparse attention and adaptive linear attention.\n- For **hardware efficiency**, the design of specialized hardware accelerators for sparse models, such as those proposed for Sparse Transformer models, can be highly relevant. These accelerators exploit sparsity to reduce computational requirements and improve overall efficiency.\n\n## Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n### Event Detection and Sparse Attention\n- Implement a selective SSM to identify significant tokens (events) based on content, as in Mamba.\n- Use content-based sparse attention mechanisms, such as those in Routing Transformers, to focus computational resources on relevant tokens.\n\n### Vector Quantization\n- Integrate VQ within the attention mechanism to compress representations of less important tokens, leveraging linearization techniques.\n\n### Adaptive Linear Attention\n- Utilize SSMs augmented with linear attention, as in SPADE, to capture global information efficiently.\n- Apply linear attention mechanisms with constant time and space complexity per token.\n\n### Meta-Learning\n- Incorporate meta-learning to adjust event detection thresholds and attention weights dynamically, based on the principles outlined in and.\n\n### Training Stability and Hardware Efficiency\n- Ensure stable training by understanding the duality between Transformers and SSMs and applying optimization and regularization strategies.\n- Explore neuromorphic hardware and accelerators optimized for SSMs and event-driven processing.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Investigate how models like SpikeGPT implement event-driven mechanisms efficiently and explore neuromorphic hardware accelerators.\n- **Training Stability Techniques**: Research optimization and regularization strategies to ensure stable training when combining multiple complex mechanisms.\n- **Prototype Development**: Implement key components starting with the event-driven SSM and integrate linear attention mechanisms, testing the effectiveness of VQ within this framework.\n- **Experimentation and Evaluation**: Design experiments to compare the performance of the proposed GAU against baseline models, evaluating metrics such as perplexity, computational efficiency, memory usage, and adaptability.\n\nBy integrating these components and leveraging the insights from the referenced works, the researcher can design a GAU that is efficient, scalable, adaptable, and robust, meeting the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and excellent scalability.\n",

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

For instance, the idea of using vector quantization to improve efficiency is mentioned in the context of linear-time transformers. The paper \"Transformer-VQ: Linear-Time Transformers via Vector Quantization\" (though not directly cited in the sources) aligns with the concept of using vector quantization to enhance transformer efficiency, which could be a starting point for integrating event-driven mechanisms.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Multiple Adaptive Components in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The stability of multiple adaptive components is a critical concern. The NeurIPS 2024 schedule includes discussions on stability and robustness in various contexts. For example, the paper \"Gradient Cuff: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models by Exploring Refusal Loss Landscapes\" touches on the robustness of large language models, which could provide insights into stabilizing adaptive components.\n- Additionally, the \"Hierarchical Action Chunking Transformer with Vector-quantization (HACT-Vq)\" from the IROS 2024 program discusses efficient learning of temporal multimodality and stability in differentiable wheel-terrain interaction models, which might offer some principles for stabilizing adaptive components in attention mechanisms.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Improvements through Combined Sparse Attention and Vector Quantization\n\n- The combination of sparse attention and vector quantization for memory efficiency is a promising area. The paper \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\" by Roy et al. (2021), though not directly mentioned in the sources, is relevant here. It discusses how sparse attention can be optimized, and integrating this with vector quantization could further enhance memory efficiency.\n- The NeurIPS 2024 schedule includes \"SmallToLarge (S2L): Scalable Data Selection for Fine-tuning Large Language Models by Summarizing Training Trajectories of Small Models,\" which, while not directly addressing sparse attention and vector quantization, discusses scalable data selection methods that could be relevant for optimizing memory usage in large models.\n\n## Meta-Learning Approaches for Dynamic Parameter Adaptation in Transformers\n\n- Meta-learning for dynamic parameter adaptation is a key aspect of the EALA proposal. The NeurIPS 2024 schedule includes several meta-learning and reinforcement learning topics that could be relevant. For example, \"RL-GPT: Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Code-as-policy\" discusses integrating reinforcement learning with transformers, which could provide insights into dynamic parameter adaptation.\n- The \"InterDreamer: Less Supervision for More Generalizable Text-Driven 3D Human-Object Interaction Synthesis\" also involves meta-learning concepts, though in a different context, which might offer some transferable ideas for dynamic parameter adaptation in transformers.\n\n## Computational Complexity Analysis of Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The computational complexity of hybrid attention mechanisms is crucial. The Embedded Systems Week discussion on \"Efficient Neural Networks: from SW optimization to specialized HW accelerators\" provides insights into optimizing neural networks for efficiency, which could be applied to analyzing the computational complexity of hybrid attention mechanisms.\n- Additionally, the NeurIPS 2024 schedule includes \"Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs): Fast Pre-trained Models for Enhanced Zero/Few-Shot Forecasting of Multivariate Time Series,\" which discusses efficient pre-trained models and could offer some principles for reducing computational complexity in hybrid attention mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, while the exact combination of event-driven mechanisms, vector quantization, and meta-learning in transformers is not directly addressed in the provided sources, there are several related discussions and concepts that can be leveraged to improve the design of autoregressive language models:\n\n- **Vector Quantization and Sparse Attention**: Concepts from papers like \"Transformer-VQ\" and \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\" can be combined to enhance efficiency.\n- **Stability Analysis**: Discussions on robustness and stability in papers like \"Gradient Cuff\" and \"Hierarchical Action Chunking Transformer with Vector-quantization (HACT-Vq)\" can provide insights.\n- **Meta-Learning**: Topics like \"RL-GPT\" and \"InterDreamer\" offer relevant meta-learning approaches.\n- **Computational Complexity**: Discussions on efficient neural networks and fast pre-trained models, such as those in Embedded Systems Week and NeurIPS 2024, can help in analyzing and optimizing computational complexity.\n\nThese insights can guide the researcher in integrating and optimizing the various components of the EALA proposal.\n",

Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/44 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2206.11894, 2022 .

Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 461  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nRodrigo Nogueira, Zhiying Jiang, and Jimmy J.

However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/34 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nLin, T., Wang, Y., Liu, X., and Qiu, X.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/16 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nSainbayar Sukhbaatar, Da Ju, Spencer Poff, Stephen Roller, Arthur Szlam, Jason Weston, and Angela Fan. 2021.

In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 312  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: vector quantization transformer attention memory efficiency stability*\n\n*Jiachen Lu, Jinghan Yao, Junge Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Hang Xu, Weiguo Gao, Chunjing Xu, T. Xiang, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** For the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants and allows much longer token sequences to be permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by self-attention. However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 132  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 3.

Inspired by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a dynamic set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG's Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on vector quantization, memory-efficient attention mechanisms, stability analysis, integration of different attention mechanisms, and empirical evaluations of memory-computation trade-offs, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Vector Quantization Techniques in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **DAQ: Density-Aware Post-Training Weight-Only Quantization For LLMs**: This work discusses a quantization method specifically designed for large language models (LLMs), which can help reduce hardware costs without significant performance degradation.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/70 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01652, 2021.

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture. We support our insights with empirical results from more than 25,000 trained models.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/51 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2302.10866, 2023.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/37 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 1067-1080, 2017. 10\n\nLi, Y., Ildiz, M.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformer adaptive stability training dynamics*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Closer Look at Learned Optimization: Stability, Robustness, and Inductive Biases\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformer adaptive stability training dynamics*\n\n*James Harrison, Luke Metz, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses tools from dynamical systems to investigate the inductive bias and stability properties of optimization algorithms, and applies the resulting insights to designing inductive biases for blackbox optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Learned optimizers -- neural networks that are trained to act as optimizers -- have the potential to dramatically accelerate training of machine learning models. However, even when meta-trained across thousands of tasks at huge computational expense, blackbox learned optimizers often struggle with stability and generalization when applied to tasks unlike those in their meta-training set. In this paper, we use tools from dynamical systems to investigate the inductive biases and stability properties of optimization algorithms, and apply the resulting insights to designing inductive biases for blackbox optimizers. Our investigation begins with a noisy quadratic model, where we characterize conditions in which optimization is stable, in terms of eigenvalues of the training dynamics. We then introduce simple modifications to a learned optimizer's architecture and meta-training procedure which lead to improved stability, and improve the optimizer's inductive bias. We apply the resulting learned optimizer to a variety of neural network training tasks, where it outperforms the current state of the art learned optimizer -- at matched optimizer computational overhead -- with regard to optimization performance and meta-training speed, and is capable of generalization to tasks far different from those it was meta-trained on.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Model-based Adversarial Meta-Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformer adaptive stability training dynamics*\n\n*Zichuan Lin, G. Thomas, Guangwen Yang, Tengyu Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Model-based Adversarial Meta-Reinforcement Learning (AdMRL), where it aims to minimize the worst-case sub-optimality gap -- the difference between the optimal return and the return that the algorithm achieves after adaptation -- across all tasks in a family of tasks, with a model-based approach.\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) aims to learn from multiple training tasks the ability to adapt efficiently to unseen test tasks. Despite the success, existing meta-RL algorithms are known to be sensitive to the task distribution shift. When the test task distribution is different from the training task distribution, the performance may degrade significantly. To address this issue, this paper proposes Model-based Adversarial Meta-Reinforcement Learning (AdMRL), where we aim to minimize the worst-case sub-optimality gap -- the difference between the optimal return and the return that the algorithm achieves after adaptation -- across all tasks in a family of tasks, with a model-based approach. We propose a minimax objective and optimize it by alternating between learning the dynamics model on a fixed task and finding the adversarial task for the current model -- the task for which the policy induced by the model is maximally suboptimal. Assuming the family of tasks is parameterized, we derive a formula for the gradient of the suboptimality with respect to the task parameters via the implicit function theorem, and show how the gradient estimator can be efficiently implemented by the conjugate gradient method and a novel use of the REINFORCE estimator. We evaluate our approach on several continuous control benchmarks and demonstrate its efficacy in the worst-case performance over all tasks, the generalization power to out-of-distribution tasks, and in training and test time sample efficiency, over existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Tuning Language Models as Training Data Generators for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformer adaptive stability training dynamics*\n\n*Yu Meng, Martin Michalski, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, T. Abdelzaher, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work first tunes an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then uses it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set, achieving an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few- shot learning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models using the provided keywords and details, here are some relevant findings and suggestions:\n\n## Meta-Learning Approaches in Transformer Architectures\n- The concept of meta-learning in transformer architectures is explored in the context of adapting models to new tasks or data efficiently. For instance, the \"Meta-Transformer\" approach investigates meta-learning techniques to enhance the adaptability of transformer models. This is discussed in the context of bridging the gap between different transformer architectures and tasks.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Adaptive Components in Neural Networks\n- Stability analysis is crucial when dealing with adaptive components in neural networks. While the provided sources do not directly address stability analysis, it is implied that integrating multiple adaptive components effectively requires careful consideration of their interactions. The \"EALA Proposal - Round 2\" analysis notes the importance of balancing efficiency and quality through gated mechanisms and other integration strategies, which indirectly touches on stability by ensuring minimal quality loss.\n\n## Training Dynamics with Multiple Adaptive Mechanisms\n- Training dynamics involving multiple adaptive mechanisms are a key focus area. The \"EALA Proposal - Round 2\" highlights the feasibility of using multiple adaptive components coexisting effectively, such as gated attention units and low-rank approximations for efficient computation. This suggests that training dynamics can be optimized by carefully designing and integrating these mechanisms to maintain both efficiency and quality.\n\n## Event-Driven Computation in Neural Networks\n- There is no direct mention of event-driven computation in the provided sources. However, event-driven approaches typically involve processing inputs only when significant changes occur, which can be efficient but may not be directly applicable to the continuous nature of transformer-based language models. Further research into specialized architectures or modifications to existing transformers might be necessary to explore this aspect.\n\n## Convergence Analysis of Meta-Learning in Transformers\n- Convergence analysis in the context of meta-learning for transformers is an important but less directly addressed topic in the provided sources. However, meta-learning approaches often involve fine-tuning and adapting weights, which can be analyzed for convergence using standard optimization techniques. For example, fine-tuning the weights of attention layers in vision transformers, as discussed in the context of vision tasks, can provide insights into how meta-learning can be optimized for convergence.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Quantization and Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: The \"EALA Proposal - Round 2\" analysis emphasizes the importance of quantization techniques and efficient attention mechanisms. These can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of transformer models. Techniques like INT8 quantization and softmax-free transformer architectures can be crucial in optimizing the model's speed and accuracy.\n\n- **Integration Strategies**: The use of gated mechanisms, low-rank approximations, and other integration strategies can help in balancing efficiency and quality. These approaches can be particularly useful when dealing with multiple adaptive components in the model.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, adaptive, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage meta-learning, ensure stability, and optimize training dynamics.\n",

Motivation\n\nThe rapid growth of language models has led to significant computational and memory challenges, particularly when processing long sequences. Traditional attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and efficiency. Moreover, models often lack adaptability to diverse input contexts, reducing robustness.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose **EventAugmentedLinearAttention (EALA)**, a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that recombines the strengths of parent designs by integrating:\n\n- **Event-Driven Sparse Attention**: Focus computational resources on significant tokens (events), reducing unnecessary computations and improving efficiency.\n- **Vector Quantization (VQ)**: Compress representations of less important tokens, decreasing memory usage and computational overhead.\n- **Adaptive Linear Attention**: Utilize linear attention mechanisms to achieve scalability with sequence length, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear.\n- **Meta-Learning**: Dynamically adjust model parameters based on input context, enhancing adaptability and robustness to varied inputs.\n\nBy synergizing these components, EALA aims to create an efficient, scalable, and robust language model block capable of handling long sequences while maintaining high performance.\n\n## 2. Related Work\n\n### Event-Driven Sparse Attention\n\n**SpikeGPT** [3] and **Routing Transformers** [4] demonstrate the effectiveness of event-driven mechanisms in focusing computational resources on significant tokens. By employing content-based sparse attention, these models reduce computational overhead without sacrificing performance.\n\n### Vector Quantization in Transformers\n\n**Transformer-VQ** [2] introduces vector quantization within transformer architectures, compressing keys and values to enable linear-time self-attention. This approach allows efficient scaling to long sequences and reduces memory consumption.\n\n### Adaptive Linear Attention\n\nLinear attention mechanisms reduce computational complexity from \\( O(N^2) \\) to \\( O(N) \\), making them suitable for long sequences. Models like **Mamba** [1] and **SPADE** incorporate State Space Models (SSMs) to capture global information efficiently, enhancing scalability and performance.\n\n### Meta-Learning in Transformers\n\nMeta-learning enables models to adapt rapidly to new tasks or input distributions. Works like **Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners** [5] and studies on the duality between Transformers and SSMs [6] provide a foundation for incorporating meta-learning into transformer architectures to enhance adaptability.\n\n### Influence on Recombination Choices\n\nThese findings validate the integration strategy for EALA, combining event-driven sparse attention, vector quantization, adaptive linear attention, and meta-learning to address efficiency, scalability, and adaptability challenges in language models.\n\n## 3. Analysis\n\n### Advantages of Parent Units\n\n- **EventVQ**:\n\n  - **Strengths**: Event-driven updates allow selective computation based on token importance, reducing unnecessary processing. Vector quantization compresses states and attention weights efficiently, improving memory efficiency.\n  - **Limitations**: Integration of event detection and VQ can introduce complexity and potential training stability issues.\n\n- **AdaptiveLinearAttention**:\n\n  - **Strengths**: Linear attention mechanisms reduce computational complexity, improving scalability. Meta-learning strategies enable dynamic adaptation to input context, enhancing robustness.\n  - **Limitations**: Meta-learning components may introduce computational overhead and implementation complexity.\n\n### Key Concept and Philosophy\n\nThe core idea of EALA is to harness the strengths of both parent designs while mitigating their weaknesses. By integrating event-driven sparse attention with vector quantization, the model effectively focuses on important tokens and compresses less significant ones. Adaptive linear attention ensures scalability, and meta-learning mechanisms dynamically adjust model parameters based on input context, enhancing adaptability and robustness.\n\n### Mathematical and Logical Arguments\n\n- **Computational Complexity Reduction**:\n\n  - Traditional attention mechanisms have \\( O(N^2) \\) complexity due to pairwise token interactions.\n  - **Linear Attention** reduces this to \\( O(N) \\) by approximating the softmax function or using kernel feature mappings [1].\n  - **Event-Driven Sparse Attention** further reduces computation by only processing significant tokens:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Effective Complexity} = O(M), \\quad \\text{where } M \\leq N \\text{ is the number of events}\n    \\]\n\n- **Memory Efficiency through Vector Quantization**:\n\n  - VQ compresses token representations, reducing memory usage:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Memory Reduction Factor} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Original Size}}{\\text{Codebook Size}}\n    \\]\n\n- **Adaptability via Meta-Learning**:\n\n  - Meta-learning adjusts model parameters to minimize a meta-objective over tasks:\n    \\[\n    \\min_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{T \\sim p(T)} \\left[ \\mathcal{L}_T \\left( \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}_T (\\theta) \\right) \\right]\n    \\]\n  - Enables rapid adaptation to new contexts, improving performance on diverse inputs.\n\n### Trade-Offs and Mitigations\n\n- **Training Stability**:\n\n  - **Challenge**: Integrating multiple complex components may destabilize training.\n  - **Solution**: Employ theoretical foundations from the duality between Transformers and SSMs [6], and use regularization and incremental integration strategies.\n\n- **Computational Overhead from Meta-Learning**:\n\n  - **Challenge**: Meta-learning may increase computation.\n  - **Solution**: Use efficient meta-learning algorithms and optimization techniques to minimize overhead.\n\n## 4.

By focusing on significant tokens and efficiently processing them, while compressing less important information, EALA reduces computational complexity and memory usage. Adaptive mechanisms ensure scalability to long sequences, and meta-learning enhances adaptability to diverse inputs. This design addresses key challenges in language modeling, providing a pathway toward more efficient, scalable, and robust models suitable for handling long sequences and varied contexts.\n\n## 7.
