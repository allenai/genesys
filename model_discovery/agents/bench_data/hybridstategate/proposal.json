    "review": "### Comprehensive Analysis of HybridStateGate Proposal\n\n#### **1. Clarity**\n\nThe **HybridStateGate** proposal is articulated with clear objectives, addressing specific challenges in current language models such as quadratic attention complexity, long-range dependency handling, high memory usage, and suboptimal hardware efficiency. The design outlines the integration of state space models (SSMs) with selective gating and hierarchical compression, coupled with hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms. The architectural components, including the `SelectiveStateModule`, `HierarchicalCompressor`, and `SelectiveGateModule`, are well-defined, with pseudo-code provided to illustrate their interactions. Furthermore, the mathematical formulations and theoretical analysis sections offer a solid foundation for understanding the proposed mechanisms. However, while the high-level design is clear, some implementation details, especially regarding the hierarchical compression strategy and its interaction with selective gating, could benefit from further elaboration to enhance comprehensibility.\n\n#### **2. Innovation**\n\nThe HybridStateGate introduces a novel integration of hierarchical compression within SSMs, combined with selective gating and hardware-efficient linear attention. While selective gating in SSMs has been effectively utilized in models like **Mamba** and **DenseMamba** to achieve linear time complexity and improved performance on long sequences, the explicit incorporation of hierarchical compression is a significant advancement. This multi-scale approach allows the model to capture dependencies at various temporal scales more effectively, potentially enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency without substantial memory overhead. Additionally, the focus on hardware-aware design aligns with recent trends in optimizing neural architectures for modern hardware, as exemplified by models like **Hyena Hierarchy**. By combining these elements, HybridStateGate positions itself as a forward-thinking architecture that leverages existing strengths while introducing meaningful improvements.\n\n#### **3. Feasibility**\n\nThe proposed design appears feasible, building upon established components like SSMs and selective gating mechanisms. The hierarchical compression technique, though innovative, is conceptually grounded and parallels methodologies seen in related fields such as computer vision and signal processing. The pseudo-code provided for the `HybridStateGate` and its subcomponents offers a practical blueprint for implementation. However, the integration of hierarchical compression with selective gating within SSMs introduces additional complexity, which may pose challenges in ensuring model stability and efficient training. Careful engineering and iterative testing will be essential to address these potential hurdles and realize the proposed architecture's full potential.\n\n#### **4. Scalability**\n\nHybridStateGate is designed with scalability in mind. The linear computational complexity of SSMs, enhanced by selective gating, ensures that the model scales efficiently with increasing sequence lengths. The introduction of hierarchical compression allows the model to manage state information at multiple scales, facilitating scalability without a proportional increase in memory or computational resources. The hardware-aware linear attention further supports scalability by optimizing memory access patterns and enabling efficient parallel processing. Benchmarks from related models like **Mamba** and **HiSS** demonstrate the effectiveness of similar approaches in scaling to long sequences and large model sizes, suggesting that HybridStateGate can maintain or even enhance scalability.\n\n#### **5. Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nThe integration of hierarchical compression is anticipated to improve the model's ability to capture complex dependencies across different temporal scales, potentially enhancing accuracy on downstream tasks. By enabling multi-scale state representations, HybridStateGate can better handle diverse and long-range dependencies inherent in natural language. Selective gating ensures that relevant information is retained while irrelevant data is filtered out, contributing to both accuracy and robustness. However, empirical evaluations are necessary to validate these theoretical advantages. The proposal's reference to models like **Mamba** and **DenseMamba**, which have demonstrated strong performance, provides a promising foundation, but the actual impact of hierarchical compression on accuracy and robustness will need to be substantiated through comprehensive experiments.\n\n#### **6. Efficiency**\n\nHybridStateGate promises significant improvements in computational and memory efficiency. By leveraging selective gating within SSMs, the model maintains linear time complexity, making it suitable for handling long sequences efficiently. Hierarchical compression adds another layer of efficiency by enabling multi-scale state representations without substantial memory overhead. The emphasis on hardware-aware linear attention mechanisms ensures optimized memory access patterns and parallel processing capabilities, further enhancing computational efficiency. References to models like **MambaCSR** and **Hyena Hierarchy** illustrate the tangible efficiency gains achievable with similar design philosophies. Nonetheless, the added complexity from hierarchical compression necessitates careful optimization to fully realize these efficiency benefits.\n\n#### **Strengths**\n\n- **Novel Integration:** Combining hierarchical compression with selective gating within SSMs is a unique contribution, potentially offering enhanced multi-scale state representations.\n- **Scalability and Efficiency:** The design effectively addresses scalability concerns with linear time complexity and hardware-efficient mechanisms.\n- **Comprehensive Design:** The proposal provides clear architectural components, mathematical formulations, and theoretical analysis, laying a strong foundation for implementation.\n- **Alignment with Current Trends:** Emphasizes hardware-aware design and optimized attention mechanisms, resonating with recent advancements in the field.\n\n#### **Concerns**\n\n- **Implementation Complexity:** Integrating hierarchical compression with selective gating introduces additional architectural complexity, which may pose challenges in ensuring model stability and efficient training.\n- **Empirical Validation:** The theoretical advantages require empirical validation to confirm their impact on accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n- **Detailed Mechanisms:** While high-level design is clear, specific implementation details, particularly regarding hierarchical compression strategies and their interplay with gating mechanisms, need further elaboration.\n- **Hardware Optimization:** Achieving optimal hardware efficiency may require sophisticated engineering efforts, especially when integrating multiple optimized components.\n\n#### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1. **Detailed Implementation Guidelines:** Provide more comprehensive details on the hierarchical compression mechanism, including specific algorithms or techniques to be used and how they interact with selective gating.\n2. **Training Stability Strategies:** Outline strategies to ensure training stability given the increased architectural complexity, such as specific initialization techniques, regularization methods, or optimization algorithms.\n3. **Empirical Evaluation Plan:** Develop a robust empirical evaluation framework to test the HybridStateGate's performance across various benchmarks, ensuring that theoretical benefits translate into practical gains.\n4. **Hardware Optimization Strategies:** Offer more insights into how the model will achieve hardware efficiency, possibly citing specific optimizations or parallel processing techniques tailored to modern hardware architectures.\n5. **Comparison with Existing Models:** Include a more explicit comparative analysis with existing models like **HiSS**, **Mamba**, and **DenseMamba**, highlighting the unique advantages of HybridStateGate.\n\n#### **Final Rating**\n\n```rating 4.2```\n\nThe HybridStateGate proposal demonstrates a well-conceived and innovative approach to enhancing autoregressive language models by integrating hierarchical compression with state space models and selective gating. Its design aligns with current research trends focused on scalability and efficiency, promising significant performance and efficiency gains. While the theoretical foundations are strong, the feasibility of seamless integration and the need for empirical validation present areas for further refinement.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/27 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10819-10829, 2022.

Specifically, Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations.

Built at large scale, Jamba provides high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, and at the same time state-of-the-art performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations. Remarkably, the model presents strong results for up to 256K tokens context length. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. We also describe several interesting properties of these architectures which the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed, and plan to release checkpoints from various ablation runs, to encourage further exploration of this novel architecture.

However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\\%, 0.9\\%, and 2.3\\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\\% faster inference and 83.7\\% GPU memory save.

Klakow*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new multi-span architecture is proposed, which separately models the short and long context information while it dynamically merges them to perform the language modeling task, and an adaptation of the Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to take into account the linguistic properties.\n\n**Abstract:** The goal of language modeling techniques is to capture the statistical and structural properties of natural languages from training corpora. This task typically involves the learning of short range dependencies, which generally model the syntactic properties of a language and/or long range dependencies, which are semantic in nature. We propose in this paper a new multi-span architecture, which separately models the short and long context information while it dynamically merges them to perform the language modeling task. This is done through a novel recurrent Long-Short Range Context (LSRC) network, which explicitly models the local (short) and global (long) context using two separate hidden states that evolve in time. This new architecture is an adaptation of the Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to take into account the linguistic properties.

While aggressive quantization (i.e., less than 4-bits) performs well for classification, it may cause severe performance degradation in image-to-image tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures. To this end, we use an efficient and hardware-friendly Haar-wavelet transform, known for its effectiveness in image compression, and define the convolution on the compressed activation map. We experiment with various tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. By combining WCC with light quantization, we achieve compression rates equivalent to 1-4bit activation quantization with relatively small and much more graceful degradation in performance.

Forsyth*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces \"unrestricted\" perturbations that manipulate semantically meaningful image-based visual descriptors -- color and texture -- in order to generate effective and photorealistic adversarial examples.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), have been shown to be vulnerable against \\emph{adversarial examples} which are carefully crafted samples with a small magnitude of the perturbation. Such adversarial perturbations are usually restricted by bounding their $\\mathcal{L}_p$ norm such that they are imperceptible, and thus many current defenses can exploit this property to reduce their adversarial impact. In this paper, we instead introduce \"unrestricted\" perturbations that manipulate semantically meaningful image-based visual descriptors -- color and texture -- in order to generate effective and photorealistic adversarial examples. We show that these semantically aware perturbations are effective against JPEG compression, feature squeezing and adversarially trained model. We also show that the proposed methods can effectively be applied to both image classification and image captioning tasks on complex datasets such as ImageNet and MSCOCO. In addition, we conduct comprehensive user studies to show that our generated semantic adversarial examples are photorealistic to humans despite large magnitude perturbations when compared to other attacks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 139  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 4. StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. CLEARER: Multi-Scale Neural Architecture Search for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale neural processing*\n\n*Yuanbiao Gou, Boyun Li, Zitao Liu, Songfan Yang, Xi Peng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A differentiable strategy could be employed to search when to fuse or extract multi-resolution features, while the discretization issue faced by the gradient-based NAS could be alleviated.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale neural networks have shown effectiveness in image restoration tasks, which are usually designed and integrated in a handcrafted manner. Different from the existing labor-intensive handcrafted architecture design paradigms, we present a novel method, termed as multi-sCaLe nEural ARchitecture sEarch for image Restoration (CLEARER), which is a speci\ufb01cally designed neural architecture search (NAS) for image restoration. Our contributions are twofold. On one hand, we design a multi-scale search space that consists of three task-\ufb02exible modules. Namely, 1) Parallel module that connects multi-resolution neural blocks in parallel, while preserving the channels and spatial-resolution in each neural block, 2) Transition module remains the existing multi-resolution features while extending them to a lower resolution, 3) Fusion module integrates multi-resolution features by passing the features of the parallel neural blocks to the current neural blocks. On the other hand, we present novel losses which could 1) balance the tradeoff between the model complexity and performance, which is highly expected to image restoration; and 2) relax the discrete architecture parameters into a continuous distribution which approximates to either 0 or 1. As a result, a differentiable strategy could be employed to search when to fuse or extract multi-resolution features, while the discretization issue faced by the gradient-based NAS could be alleviated. The proposed CLEARER could search a promising architecture in two GPU hours. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method comparing with nine image denoising methods and eight image deraining approaches in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Weakly-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation with SAM-based Pseudo Labeling and Multi-scale Feature Grouping\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale neural processing*\n\n*Chunming He, Kai Li, Yachao Zhang, Guoxia Xu, Longxiang Tang, Yulun Zhang, Z. Guo, Xiu Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images.\n\n**Abstract:** Weakly-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (WSCOS) aims to segment objects well blended with surrounding environments using sparsely-annotated data for model training. It remains a challenging task since (1) it is hard to distinguish concealed objects from the background due to the intrinsic similarity and (2) the sparsely-annotated training data only provide weak supervision for model learning. In this paper, we propose a new WSCOS method to address these two challenges. To tackle the intrinsic similarity challenge, we design a multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results. By grouping similar features together, it encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images. For the weak supervision challenge, we utilize the recently-proposed vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and use the provided sparse annotations as prompts to generate segmentation masks, which are used to train the model. To alleviate the impact of low-quality segmentation masks, we further propose a series of strategies, including multi-augmentation result ensemble, entropy-based pixel-level weighting, and entropy-based image-level selection. These strategies help provide more reliable supervision to train the segmentation model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on various WSCOS tasks, and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale neural processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Semantic Perceptual Image Compression using Deep Convolution Networks\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression neural networks*\n\n*James Storer, Solomon Garber, Nick Moran, Aaditya Prakash, Antonella DiLillo*\n\n**Abstract:** It has long been considered a significant problem to improve the visual\nquality of lossy image and video compression. Recent advances in computing\npower together with the availability of large training data sets has increased\ninterest in the application of deep learning cnns to address image recognition\nand image processing tasks. Here, we present a powerful cnn tailored to the\nspecific task of semantic image understanding to achieve higher visual quality\nin lossy compression. A modest increase in complexity is incorporated to the\nencoder which allows a standard, off-the-shelf jpeg decoder to be used. While\njpeg encoding may be optimized for generic images, the process is ultimately\nunaware of the specific content of the image to be compressed. Our technique\nmakes jpeg content-aware by designing and training a model to identify multiple\nsemantic regions in a given image. Unlike object detection techniques, our\nmodel does not require labeling of object positions and is able to identify\nobjects in a single pass. We present a new cnn architecture directed\nspecifically to image compression, which generates a map that highlights\nsemantically-salient regions so that they can be encoded at higher quality as\ncompared to background regions. By adding a complete set of features for every\nclass, and then taking a threshold over the sum of all feature activations, we\ngenerate a map that highlights semantically-salient regions so that they can be\nencoded at a better quality compared to background regions. Experiments are\npresented on the Kodak PhotoCD dataset and the MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset,\nin which our algorithm achieves higher visual quality for the same compressed\nsize.\n\n**Published:** 2016-12-27\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This study affirms that the compressed latent representation can predict human perceptual distance judgments with an accuracy comparable to a custom-tailored DNN-based quality metric. We further investigate various neural encoders and demonstrate the effectiveness of employing the analysis transform as a perceptual loss network for image tasks beyond quality judgments. Our experiments show that the off-the-shelf neural encoder proves proficient in perceptual modeling without needing an additional VGG network. We expect this research to serve as a valuable reference developing of a semantic-aware and coding-efficient neural encoder.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models language*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Armin W. Thomas, Khaled K. Saab, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Semantic Compression Techniques in Neural Networks\n\n**Semantic compression** in the context of language models involves reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements while preserving the model's performance. Here are some relevant techniques:\n\n- **Post-training quantization**: This method reduces the precision of the model's parameters, which can significantly decrease the memory requirements. For example, techniques like SmoothQuant and AWQ (Adaptive Weight Quantization) have been developed to quantize large language models with minimal performance loss. These methods are highlighted in the work of Song Han, where quantization techniques like SmoothQuant and AWQ are used to enable efficient inference on large language models.\n\n- **Tokenization and Embedding Compression**: Efficient tokenization methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece can compress datasets by representing words as subwords. Additionally, special tokens and embeddings can be optimized to reduce the overall size of the model. For instance, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 splits words into subwords, which helps in compressing the dataset.\n\n### 2. Recent Advances in State Space Models for Sequence Processing\n\n**State space models** are gaining attention as alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms due to their potential for efficiency and scalability.\n\n- **Gated State Space (GSS) Models**: These models, as proposed by Mehta et al., use gated activation functions to train faster than traditional state space models. The GSS layer is designed to handle long-range dependencies efficiently, which is crucial for sequence processing in language models[Analysis Note, Reference 2].\n\n- **State Space Models with Linear Attention**: Combining state space models with linear attention mechanisms can further reduce computational complexity. For example, Katharopoulos et al. show how linear dot-product attention can be used within state space models to achieve O(N) complexity instead of O(N\u00b2)[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n### 3. Implementation Details of Multi-Scale Processing in Neural Architectures\n\n**Multi-scale processing** enhances feature representation by handling different scales of input data.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: Models can use hierarchical attention to process sequences at multiple scales. For instance, Qin et al. propose splitting attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks, using conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention for inter-blocks. This approach allows for efficient processing of sequences at different scales[Analysis Note, Reference 5].\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: This involves dividing the input sequence into blocks and processing each block separately. This method is efficient for handling long sequences and can be combined with multi-scale processing to enhance feature representation. Zhu et al. discuss a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach within a block-based framework, which captures local window patterns efficiently[Analysis Note, Reference 4].\n\n### 4. Methods for Combining Different Architectural Components Efficiently\n\n**Combining attention, state spaces, and compression** requires careful design to leverage the benefits of each component.\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining state space models with attention mechanisms can offer a balance between efficiency and performance. For example, integrating gated state space models with linear attention can reduce computational complexity while maintaining the ability to capture long-range dependencies[Analysis Note, References 2 and 3].\n\n- **Adaptive Compression and Sparsity**: Using adaptive compression techniques along with structured sparsity can help maintain accuracy while improving speed. Song Han's work on model compression, including pruning and quantization, demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to large language models to achieve significant reductions in size and computational requirements without hurting accuracy.\n\n- **Streaming Architectures**: These architectures enable the efficient processing of unbounded sequences by handling input streams in real-time. StreamingLLM, for instance, supports infinite input length for LLM inference, which is integrated into various platforms like HPC-AI Tech SwiftInfer.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of semantic compression, state space models, multi-scale processing, and hybrid architectural designs.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content.

Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference ( $5 \\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 19 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid neural architectures, selective attention mechanisms, efficient state management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid neural architectures*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model, which was then out-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First, we identify several key modeling and training techniques, and apply them to the RNN architecture, yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT\u201914 English to French and English to German tasks. Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths.

IIANet: An Intra- and Inter-Modality Attention Network for Audio-Visual Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: selective attention mechanisms*\n\n*Kai Li, Run Yang, Fuchun Sun, Xiaolin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The fast version of IIANet (IIANet-fast) has only 7% of CTCNet's MACs and is 40% faster than CTCNet on CPUs while achieving better separation quality, showing the great potential of attention mechanism for efficient and effective multimodal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research has made significant progress in designing fusion modules for audio-visual speech separation. However, they predominantly focus on multi-modal fusion at a single temporal scale of auditory and visual features without employing selective attention mechanisms, which is in sharp contrast with the brain. To address this issue, We propose a novel model called Intra- and Inter-Attention Network (IIANet), which leverages the attention mechanism for efficient audio-visual feature fusion. IIANet consists of two types of attention blocks: intra-attention (IntraA) and inter-attention (InterA) blocks, where the InterA blocks are distributed at the top, middle and bottom of IIANet. Heavily inspired by the way how human brain selectively focuses on relevant content at various temporal scales, these blocks maintain the ability to learn modality-specific features and enable the extraction of different semantics from audio-visual features. Comprehensive experiments on three standard audio-visual separation benchmarks (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrate the effectiveness of IIANet, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable inference time. In particular, the fast version of IIANet (IIANet-fast) has only 7% of CTCNet's MACs and is 40% faster than CTCNet on CPUs while achieving better separation quality, showing the great potential of attention mechanism for efficient and effective multimodal fusion.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. SPECTRA: Sparse Structured Text Rationalization\n\n*From Search Query: selective attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nuno M. Guerreiro, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a unified framework for deterministic extraction of structured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a differentiable layer and provides a comparative study of stochastic and deterministic methods for rationale extraction for classification and natural language inference tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Selective rationalization aims to produce decisions along with rationales (e.g., text highlights or word alignments between two sentences). Commonly, rationales are modeled as stochastic binary masks, requiring sampling-based gradient estimators, which complicates training and requires careful hyperparameter tuning. Sparse attention mechanisms are a deterministic alternative, but they lack a way to regularize the rationale extraction (e.g., to control the sparsity of a text highlight or the number of alignments). In this paper, we present a unified framework for deterministic extraction of structured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a differentiable layer. Our approach greatly eases training and rationale regularization, generally outperforming previous work on what comes to performance and plausibility of the extracted rationales. We further provide a comparative study of stochastic and deterministic methods for rationale extraction for classification and natural language inference tasks, jointly assessing their predictive power, quality of the explanations, and model variability.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Closed-Book Training to Improve Summarization Encoder Memory\n\n*From Search Query: selective attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yichen Jiang, Mohit Bansal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a memory ability test, two saliency metrics, as well as several sanity-check ablations to prove that the encoder of the 2-decoder model does in fact learn stronger memory representations than the baseline encoder.\n\n**Abstract:** A good neural sequence-to-sequence summarization model should have a strong encoder that can distill and memorize the important information from long input texts so that the decoder can generate salient summaries based on the encoder\u2019s memory. In this paper, we aim to improve the memorization capabilities of the encoder of a pointer-generator model by adding an additional \u2018closed-book\u2019 decoder without attention and pointer mechanisms. Such a decoder forces the encoder to be more selective in the information encoded in its memory state because the decoder can\u2019t rely on the extra information provided by the attention and possibly copy modules, and hence improves the entire model. On the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, our 2-decoder model outperforms the baseline significantly in terms of ROUGE and METEOR metrics, for both cross-entropy and reinforced setups (and on human evaluation). Moreover, our model also achieves higher scores in a test-only DUC-2002 generalizability setup. We further present a memory ability test, two saliency metrics, as well as several sanity-check ablations (based on fixed-encoder, gradient-flow cut, and model capacity) to prove that the encoder of our 2-decoder model does in fact learn stronger memory representations than the baseline encoder.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

We model these problems as Exo-MDPs (Markov Decision Processes with Exogenous Inputs) and design a class of data-efficient algorithms for them termed Hindsight Learning (HL). Our HL algorithms achieve data efficiency by leveraging a key insight: having samples of the exogenous variables, past decisions can be revisited in hindsight to infer counterfactual consequences that can accelerate policy improvements. We compare HL against classic baselines in the multi-secretary and airline revenue management problems. We also scale our algorithms to a business-critical cloud resource management problem -- allocating Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines, and simulate their performance with real datasets from a large public cloud provider.

Meanwhile, neural architecture search methods are surging with an expectation to reduce human efforts. However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle diversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and transformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS method that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by large weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More specifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel self-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each block separately before searching them as a whole towards the population center. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid CNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this challenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5% accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute time. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with 0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with ImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods.

NASA: Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration for Hardware Inspired Hybrid Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid neural architectures*\n\n*Yingyan Lin, Zhongfeng Wang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Huihong Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Multiplication is arguably the most cost-dominant operation in modern deep neural networks (DNNs), limiting their achievable efficiency and thus more extensive deployment in resource-constrained applications. To tackle this limitation, pioneering works have developed handcrafted multiplication-free DNNs, which require expert knowledge and time-consuming manual iteration, calling for fast development tools. To this end, we propose a Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration framework dubbed NASA, which enables automated multiplication-reduced DNN development and integrates a dedicated multiplication-reduced accelerator for boosting DNNs' achievable efficiency. Specifically, NASA adopts neural architecture search (NAS) spaces that augment the state-of-the-art one with hardware-inspired multiplication-free operators, such as shift and adder, armed with a novel progressive pretrain strategy (PGP) together with customized training recipes to automatically search for optimal multiplication-reduced DNNs; On top of that, NASA further develops a dedicated accelerator, which advocates a chunk-based template and auto-mapper dedicated for NASA-NAS resulting DNNs to better leverage their algorithmic properties for boosting hardware efficiency.

AFS: An Attention-based mechanism for Supervised Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: selective attention mechanisms*\n\n*Danni Ge, Ning Gui, Ziyin Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its\neffectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks.\nThe proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has\nbrought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy\ndata, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel\nneural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based\nFeature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention\nmodule for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem\nmodeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features\nand supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a\nshallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on\nthe distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by\nbackpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows\nexisting off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less\ntraining time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A\nhybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection\naccuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation.\nExperimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in\ncomparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both\nMNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-28\n\n\n\n#### 4. How Does Selective Mechanism Improve Self-Attention Networks?\n\n*From Search Query: selective attention mechanisms*\n\n*Long-Yue Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xing Wang, Xinwei Geng, Ting Liu, Bing Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention networks (SANs) with selective mechanism has produced substantial improvements in various NLP tasks by concentrating on a subset of input words. However, the underlying reasons for their strong performance have not been well explained. In this paper, we bridge the gap by assessing the strengths of selective SANs (SSANs), which are implemented with a flexible and universal Gumbel-Softmax. Experimental results on several representative NLP tasks, including natural language inference, semantic role labelling, and machine translation, show that SSANs consistently outperform the standard SANs. Through well-designed probing experiments, we empirically validate that the improvement of SSANs can be attributed in part to mitigating two commonly-cited weaknesses of SANs: word order encoding and structure modeling. Specifically, the selective mechanism improves SANs by paying more attention to content words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence.

HeterPS: Distributed Deep Learning With Reinforcement Learning Based Scheduling in Heterogeneous Environments\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management*\n\n*Dejing Dou, Xuefeng Yao, Xinxuan Wu, Minxu Zhang, Danlei Feng, Yanjun Ma, dianhai yu, Zhihua Wu, Ji Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) exploit many layers and a large number of parameters to achieve excellent performance. The training process of DNN models generally handles large-scale input data with many sparse features, which incurs high Input/Output (IO) cost, while some layers are compute-intensive. The training process generally exploits distributed computing resources to reduce training time. In addition, heterogeneous computing resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs of multiple types, are available for the distributed training process. Thus, the scheduling of multiple layers to diverse computing resources is critical for the training process. To efficiently train a DNN model using the heterogeneous computing resources, we propose a distributed framework, i.e., Paddle-Heterogeneous Parameter Server (Paddle-HeterPS), composed of a distributed architecture and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based scheduling method. The advantages of Paddle-HeterPS are three-fold compared with existing frameworks. First, Paddle-HeterPS enables efficient training process of diverse workloads with heterogeneous computing resources. Second, Paddle-HeterPS exploits an RL-based method to efficiently schedule the workload of each layer to appropriate computing resources to minimize the cost while satisfying throughput constraints. Third, Paddle-HeterPS manages data storage and data communication among distributed computing resources. We carry out extensive experiments to show that Paddle-HeterPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput (14.5 times higher) and monetary cost (312.3% smaller).

OneFlow: Redesign the Distributed Deep Learning Framework from Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management*\n\n*Jie Zhao, Haoran Zhang, Chuan Wu, Xiaodong Yi, Fei Yang, Chi Yao, Shenghang Cai, Ran Guo, Juncheng Liu, Cheng Cheng, Xinqi Li, Jinhui Yuan*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch provide a productive interface for expressing and training a deep neural network (DNN) model on a single device or using data parallelism. Still, they may not be flexible or efficient enough in training emerging large models on distributed devices, which require more sophisticated parallelism beyond data parallelism. Plugins or wrappers have been developed to strengthen these frameworks for model or pipeline parallelism, but they complicate the usage and implementation of distributed deep learning. Aiming at a simple, neat redesign of distributed deep learning frameworks for various parallelism paradigms, we present OneFlow, a novel distributed training framework based on an SBP (split, broadcast and partial-value) abstraction and the actor model. SBP enables much easier programming of data parallelism and model parallelism than existing frameworks, and the actor model provides a succinct runtime mechanism to manage the complex dependencies imposed by resource constraints, data movement and computation in distributed deep learning. We demonstrate the general applicability and efficiency of OneFlow for training various large DNN models with case studies and extensive experiments. The results show that OneFlow outperforms many well-known customized libraries built on top of the state-of-the-art frameworks. The code of OneFlow is available at: https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hybrid architectures combining State Space Models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and techniques that can be leveraged:\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining SSMs with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### E-Tamba\nE-Tamba is a hybrid model that integrates the strengths of Transformers and Mamba (an SSM). It uses a novel layer importance analysis and transplantation method to fine-tune a hybrid model, combining Pythia-1.4B (a Transformer) and Mamba-1.4B. This hybrid model, E-Tamba-1.1B, outperforms both Pythia-1.4B and Mamba-1.4B in terms of perplexity and matches Pythia-1.4B's performance on various NLP downstream tasks while reducing inference memory usage by 3X compared to Pythia-1.4B.\n\n### Zamba\nZamba blends Mamba blocks with a globally shared attention layer applied after every six Mamba blocks. This architecture enhances the model's ability to learn long-range dependencies and perform in-context learning more efficiently, reducing computational demands during both training and inference compared to standard Transformer models.\n\n### Jamba\nJamba is another hybrid model that interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers. This architecture benefits from the strengths of both model families and includes Mixture of Experts (MoE) to increase model capacity while managing active parameter usage[Analysis Note].\n\n### Taipan\nTaipan introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of Mamba with enhanced long-range dependency handling through Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This setup mitigates the limitations of Mamba in scenarios requiring in-context retrieval or handling complex long-range dependencies.\n\n## Selective Attention and State Management Techniques\n\n### Selective Attention Layers (SALs)\nTaipan uses SALs to enhance long-range dependency handling. These layers address the Markovian nature of Mamba, which can lead to information loss for tokens needing interactions with distant tokens. SALs improve the model's ability to handle complex dependencies.\n\n### Hierarchical State Management\nHybrid models like E-Tamba and Jamba benefit from hierarchical state management. For example, E-Tamba leverages the long-context capabilities of Transformers while utilizing the memory efficiency of Mamba, allowing for better handling of long sequences[Analysis Note].\n\n### Content-Dependent State Updates\nMamba models improve adaptability by letting SSM parameters be functions of the input, addressing weaknesses in discrete modalities. This selective state update mechanism enhances the model's ability to perform content-based reasoning[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Neural Architectures\n\n### Memory Efficiency\nHybrid models like E-Tamba and Zamba significantly reduce memory usage during inference. E-Tamba-1.1B reduces inference memory usage by 3X compared to Pythia-1.4B, making it a hardware-efficient solution.\n\n### Linear-Time Complexity\nSSMs, such as Mamba, offer linear-time complexity, which is more efficient than the quadratic complexity of Transformer attention mechanisms. This makes SSM-based models more scalable and efficient for long-sequence tasks.\n\n## Advanced Gating Mechanisms for State and Information Flow Control\n\n### Selective State Compression\nMamba and its variants use selective state compression to reduce memory requirements. This is particularly important in models that need to handle long sequences efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n### Dense Connections\nDenseMamba introduces dense connections between SSM layers, which improve information flow while maintaining parallel training capability and inference efficiency. This approach enhances the overall performance of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n### Content-Based Parameter Generation\nMamba models use content-based parameter generation, where SSM parameters are functions of the input. This approach improves the model's adaptability and ability to perform content-based reasoning[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of both SSMs and attention mechanisms.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.07)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/43 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 32, 2019.

SoteriaFL: A Unified Framework for Private Federated Learning with Communication Compression\n\n*From Search Query: advanced compression techniques neural networks*\n\n*Zhize Li, Haoyu Zhao, Boyue Li, Yuejie Chi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a unified framework SoteriaFL for private federated learning, which accommodates a general family of local gradient estimators including popular stochastic variance-reduced gradient methods and the state-of-the-art shifted compression scheme and provides a comprehensive characterization of its performance trade-offs in terms of privacy, utility, and communication complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To enable large-scale machine learning in bandwidth-hungry environments such as wireless networks, significant progress has been made recently in designing communication-efficient federated learning algorithms with the aid of communication compression. On the other end, privacy-preserving, especially at the client level, is another important desideratum that has not been addressed simultaneously in the presence of advanced communication compression techniques yet. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that enhances the communication efficiency of private federated learning with communication compression. Exploiting both general compression operators and local differential privacy, we first examine a simple algorithm that applies compression directly to differentially-private stochastic gradient descent, and identify its limitations. We then propose a unified framework SoteriaFL for private federated learning, which accommodates a general family of local gradient estimators including popular stochastic variance-reduced gradient methods and the state-of-the-art shifted compression scheme. We provide a comprehensive characterization of its performance trade-offs in terms of privacy, utility, and communication complexity, where SoteraFL is shown to achieve better communication complexity without sacrificing privacy nor utility than other private federated learning algorithms without communication compression.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Searching Lottery Tickets in Graph Neural Networks: A Dual Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: advanced compression techniques neural networks*\n\n*Kun Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Pengkun Wang, Xu Wang, Pengfei Gu, Junfeng Fang, Yang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This proposal helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability and rigorously proves that the model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various graph learning tasks. However, the computational overheads of fitting GNNs to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to GNNs from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in GNNs with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While GLT provides new insights for GNN compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in GLT utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective \u2013 transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. Compared to GLT, our proposal helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability. More importantly, we rigorously prove that our model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory. Extensive experimental results on various graphrelated tasks validate the effectiveness of our framework.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: advanced compression techniques neural networks*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Symmetric Replay Training: Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization deep learning*\n\n*Hyeon-Seob Kim, Minsu Kim, Sungsoo Ahn, Jinkyoo Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple but effective method, called symmetric replay training (SRT), which can be easily integrated into various DRL methods and leverages high-reward samples to encourage exploration of the under-explored symmetric regions without additional online interactions - free.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has significantly advanced the field of combinatorial optimization (CO). However, its practicality is hindered by the necessity for a large number of reward evaluations, especially in scenarios involving computationally intensive function assessments. To enhance the sample efficiency, we propose a simple but effective method, called symmetric replay training (SRT), which can be easily integrated into various DRL methods. Our method leverages high-reward samples to encourage exploration of the under-explored symmetric regions without additional online interactions - free. Through replay training, the policy is trained to maximize the likelihood of the symmetric trajectories of discovered high-rewarded samples. Experimental results demonstrate the consistent improvement of our method in sample efficiency across diverse DRL methods applied to real-world tasks, such as molecular optimization and hardware design.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Robust Non-Linear Feedback Coding via Power-Constrained Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization deep learning*\n\n*Junghoon Kim, Taejoon Kim, D. Love, Christopher G. Brinton*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a new family of non-linear feedback codes that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise and observes that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.\n\n**Abstract:** The design of codes for feedback-enabled communications has been a long-standing open problem. Recent research on non-linear, deep learning-based coding schemes have demonstrated significant improvements in communication reliability over linear codes, but are still vulnerable to the presence of forward and feedback noise over the channel. In this paper, we develop a new family of non-linear feedback codes that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise. Our autoencoder-based architecture is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes, and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes. Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. NeuroEvoBench: Benchmarking Evolutionary Optimizers for Deep Learning Applications\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization deep learning*\n\n*Robert Tjarko Lange, Yujin Tang, Yingtao Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new benchmark of EO methods (NeuroEvoBench) is established tailored toward Deep Learning applications and exhaustively evaluate traditional and meta-learned EO, investigating core scientific questions including resource allocation, fitness shaping, normalization, regularization&scalability of Eo.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the Deep Learning community has become interested in evolutionary optimization (EO) as a means to address hard optimization problems, e.g. meta-learning through long inner loop unrolls or optimizing non-differentiable operators. One core reason for this trend has been the recent innovation in hardware acceleration and compatible software - making distributed population evaluations much easier than before. Unlike for gradient descent-based methods though, there is a lack of hyperparameter understanding and best practices for EO - arguably due to severely less 'graduate student descent' and benchmarking being performed for EO methods. Additionally, classical benchmarks from the evolutionary community provide few practical insights for Deep Learning applications. This poses challenges for newcomers to hardware-accelerated EO and hinders significant adoption. Hence, we establish a new benchmark of EO methods (NeuroEvoBench) tailored toward Deep Learning applications and exhaustively evaluate traditional and meta-learned EO. We investigate core scientific questions including resource allocation, fitness shaping, normalization, regularization&scalability of EO.

Improving the Gating Mechanism of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Albert Gu, \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, T. Paine, Matthew W. Hoffman, Razvan Pascanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Gating mechanisms are widely used in neural network models, where they allow gradients to backpropagate more easily through depth or time. However, their saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Event Detection: Gate Diversity and Syntactic Importance Scores for Graph Convolution Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Viet Dac Lai, Tuan Ngo Nguyen, Thien Huu Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate and introduces novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies on event detection (ED) have shown that the syntactic dependency graph can be employed in graph convolution neural networks (GCN) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the computation of the hidden vectors in such graph-based models is agnostic to the trigger candidate words, potentially leaving irrelevant information for the trigger candidate for event prediction. In addition, the current models for ED fail to exploit the overall contextual importance scores of the words, which can be obtained via the dependency tree, to boost the performance. In this study, we propose a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate. We also introduce novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two ED datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 9. Can recurrent neural networks warp time?\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Corentin Tallec, Y. Ollivier*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that learnable gates in a recurrent model formally provide quasi- invariance to general time transformations in the input data, which leads to a new way of initializing gate biases in LSTMs and GRUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Successful recurrent models such as long short-term memories (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) use ad hoc gating mechanisms. Empirically these models have been found to improve the learning of medium to long term temporal dependencies and to help with vanishing gradient issues. We prove that learnable gates in a recurrent model formally provide quasi- invariance to general time transformations in the input data. We recover part of the LSTM architecture from a simple axiomatic approach. This result leads to a new way of initializing gate biases in LSTMs and GRUs. Ex- perimentally, this new chrono initialization is shown to greatly improve learning of long term dependencies, with minimal implementation effort.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 128  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. OTOv3: Automatic Architecture-Agnostic Neural Network Training and Compression from Structured Pruning to Erasing Operators\n\n*From Search Query: advanced compression techniques neural networks*\n\n*Luming Liang, Ilya Zharkov, HsiangTao Wu, Zeyu Chen, Zhihui Zhu, Tianyu Ding, Tianyi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing a predefined deep neural network (DNN) into a compact sub-network with competitive performance is crucial in the efficient machine learning realm. This topic spans various techniques, from structured pruning to neural architecture search, encompassing both pruning and erasing operators perspectives. Despite advancements, existing methods suffers from complex, multi-stage processes that demand substantial engineering and domain knowledge, limiting their broader applications. We introduce the third-generation Only-Train-Once (OTOv3), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN through pruning and erasing operations, creating a compact and competitive sub-network without the need of fine-tuning. OTOv3 simplifies and automates the training and compression process, minimizes the engineering efforts required from users. It offers key technological advancements: (i) automatic search space construction for general DNNs based on dependency graph analysis; (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) and its enhanced version with hierarchical search (H2SPG) to reliably solve (hierarchical) structured sparsity problems and ensure sub-network validity; and (iii) automated sub-network construction using solutions from DHSPG/H2SPG and dependency graphs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of OTOv3 across various benchmarks in structured pruning and neural architecture search. OTOv3 produces sub-networks that match or exceed the state-of-the-arts. The source code will be available at https://github.com/tianyic/only_train_once.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. Conditional Probability Models for Deep Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: advanced compression techniques neural networks*\n\n*Luc van Gool, Radu Timofte, Eirikur Agustsson, Michael Tschannen, Fabian Mentzer*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks trained as image auto-encoders have recently emerged as a promising direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in image compression. The key challenge in learning such networks is twofold: To deal with quantization, and to control the trade-off between reconstruction error (distortion) and entropy (rate) of the latent image representation. In this paper, we focus on the latter challenge and propose a new technique to navigate the rate-distortion trade-off for an image compression auto-encoder. The main idea is to directly model the entropy of the latent representation by using a context model: A 3D-CNN which learns a conditional probability model of the latent distribution of the auto-encoder. During training, the auto-encoder makes use of the context model to estimate the entropy of its representation, and the context model is concurrently updated to learn the dependencies between the symbols in the latent representation. Our experiments show that this approach, when measured in MS-SSIM, yields a state-of-the-art image compression system based on a simple convolutional auto-encoder.\n\n**Conference:** conditional-probability-models-for-deep-image-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization deep learning*\n\n*Jeff Rasley, Samyam Rajbhandari, Olatunji Ruwase, Yuxiong He*\n\n**Abstract:** Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware. We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO to create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization deep learning*\n\n*Rohan Anil, Kevin Regan, Yoram Singer, Vineet Gupta, Tomer Koren*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gaussian Gated Linear Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Eren Sezener, Adam Marblestone, David Budden, Joel Veness, Tor Lattimore, Greg Wayne*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Gaussian Gated Linear Network (G-GLN), an extension to the recently proposed GLN family of deep neural networks. Instead of using backpropagation to learn features, GLNs have a distributed and local credit assignment mechanism based on optimizing a convex objective. This gives rise to many desirable properties including universality, data-efficient online learning, trivial interpretability and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We extend the GLN framework from classification to multiple regression and density modelling by generalizing geometric mixing to a product of Gaussian densities. The G-GLN achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on several univariate and multivariate regression benchmarks, and we demonstrate its applicability to practical tasks including online contextual bandits and density estimation via denoising.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 6.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 35/59 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\narXiv:2401.04722, 2024. [40] H.

TimeToM: Temporal Space is the Key to Unlocking the Door of Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind\n\n*From Search Query: advanced state space models*\n\n*Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Weiming Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** TimeToM is presented, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios and designs a novel tool-belief solver that can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period.\n\n**Abstract:** Theory of Mind (ToM)-the cognitive ability to reason about mental states of ourselves and others, is the foundation of social interaction. Although ToM comes naturally to humans, it poses a significant challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the complex logical chains in ToM reasoning, especially in higher-order ToM questions, simply utilizing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) will not improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs. We present TimeToM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios. Specifically, within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character and inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively. Moreover, we design a novel tool-belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period. Experimental results indicate that TimeToM can dramatically improve the reasoning performance of LLMs on ToM questions while taking a big step towards coherent and robust ToM reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: advanced state space models*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce Maize, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate Maize across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6\u201310x.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 67*)\n\n#### 4.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

However, current algorithms fall short of offline backpropagation by either not being scalable or failing to learn long-range dependencies.

We achieve this by leveraging independent recurrent modules in multi-layer networks, an architectural motif that has recently been shown to be particularly powerful. Experiments on synthetic memory problems and on the challenging long-range arena benchmark suite reveal that our algorithm performs competitively, establishing a new standard for what can be achieved through online learning.

DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured\n  LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that\nprocess multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of\ntokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative\ndecoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications\nare inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during\nattention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose\nFlattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the\nKV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU\nutilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and\nnearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves\nup to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three\npractical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention\nalgorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-30T04:34:54Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Long-Short Range Context Neural Networks for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: long range dependencies*\n\n*Youssef Oualil, Mittul Singh, Clayton Greenberg, Dietrich Klakow*\n\n**Abstract:** The goal of language modeling techniques is to capture the statistical and\nstructural properties of natural languages from training corpora. This task\ntypically involves the learning of short range dependencies, which generally\nmodel the syntactic properties of a language and/or long range dependencies,\nwhich are semantic in nature.

Advancing the State-of-the-Art for ECG Analysis through Structured State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: advanced state space models*\n\n*Nils Strodthoff, Temesgen Mehari*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of deep-learning-based ECG analysis has been largely dominated by convolutional architectures. This work explores the prospects of applying the recently introduced structured state space models (SSMs) as a particularly promising approach due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series. We demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art for ECG classification, which we trace back to individual pathologies. Furthermore, the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies allows to shed light on long-standing questions in the literature such as the optimal sampling rate or window size to train classification models. Interestingly, we find no evidence for using data sampled at 500Hz as opposed to 100Hz and no advantages from extending the model's input size beyond 3s. Based on this very promising first assessment, SSMs could develop into a new modeling paradigm for ECG analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. EchoMamba4Rec: Harmonizing Bidirectional State Space Models with Spectral Filtering for Advanced Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: advanced state space models*\n\n*Shengxin Zhu, Xuxin He, Yuda Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Predicting user preferences and sequential dependencies based on historical behavior is the core goal of sequential recommendation. Although attention-based models have shown effectiveness in this field, they often struggle with inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, especially with long-range behavior sequences. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements of state space models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, we introduce EchoMamba4Rec. Control theory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies and maintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices. EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequential recommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domain filtering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction data more effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models (SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mamba module that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraging information from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoMamba significantly outperforms existing models, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Temporal FiLM: Capturing Long-Range Sequence Dependencies with Feature-Wise Modulations.\n\n*From Search Query: long range dependencies*\n\n*Zayd Enam, Sawyer Birnbaum, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Pang Wei W. Koh, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning representations that accurately capture long-range dependencies in sequential inputs --- including text, audio, and genomic data --- is a key problem in deep learning. Feed-forward convolutional models capture only feature interactions within finite receptive fields while recurrent architectures can be slow and difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. Here, we propose Temporal Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (TFiLM) --- a novel architectural component inspired by adaptive batch normalization and its extensions --- that uses a recurrent neural network to alter the activations of a convolutional model. This approach expands the receptive field of convolutional sequence models with minimal computational overhead. Empirically, we find that TFiLM significantly improves the learning speed and accuracy of feed-forward neural networks on a range of generative and discriminative learning tasks, including text classification and audio super-resolution.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Modelling Long Range Dependencies in $N$D: From Task-Specific to a General Purpose CNN\n\n*From Search Query: long range dependencies*\n\n*Jan-Jakob Sonke, Mark Hoogendoorn, Jakub M. Tomczak, Erik J. Bekkers, Efstratios Gavves, Albert Gu, David W. Romero, David M. Knigge*\n\n**Abstract:** Performant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures must be tailored to specific tasks in order to consider the length, resolution, and dimensionality of the input data. In this work, we tackle the need for problem-specific CNN architectures. We present the Continuous Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN): a single CNN able to process data of arbitrary resolution, dimensionality and length without any structural changes. Its key component are its continuous convolutional kernels which model long-range dependencies at every layer, and thus remove the need of current CNN architectures for task-dependent downsampling and depths. We showcase the generality of our method by using the same architecture for tasks on sequential ($1{\\rm D}$), visual ($2{\\rm D}$) and point-cloud ($3{\\rm D}$) data. Our CCNN matches and often outperforms the current state-of-the-art across all tasks considered.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on advanced state space models, hardware-efficient attention mechanisms, techniques for handling long-range dependencies, and methods for combining different architectural components efficiently, here are some key findings and insights:\n\n## Recent Advances in State Space Models for Language Modeling\n\nState Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional transformer-based models for language modeling. Here are some recent advances:\n\n- **Taipan Model**: This model combines the efficiency of State Space Models (like Mamba) with the expressive power of transformers by incorporating Selective Attention Layers (SALs). Taipan balances the efficiency of SSMs with the performance of transformers, allowing for accurate predictions over long context lengths (up to 1 million tokens) while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n- **Efficient Inference and Linear Scaling**: SSMs such as Mamba offer high performance with efficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length, which is crucial for handling long-range dependencies.\n\n- **State Space Duality**: Recent work on State Space Duality (SSD) simplifies the matrix transformations in SSMs, making them more efficient and scalable for various NLP tasks.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\nHardware-efficient attention mechanisms are vital for improving the performance and scalability of language models:\n\n- **Selective Attention Layers (SALs)**: In the Taipan model, SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and augment their representations using attention modules. This approach reduces the computational cost while maintaining performance.\n\n- **Parallel Processing**: SSMs can be trained in parallel, which significantly reduces training time and improves efficiency compared to traditional RNNs. This parallel processing capability is a key advantage in hardware-efficient designs.\n\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Techniques like FlashAttention, which use tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, are essential for hardware-efficient attention mechanisms. These algorithms optimize memory access patterns, leading to significant speedups[Analysis Note].\n\n## Techniques for Handling Long-Range Dependencies\n\nHandling long-range dependencies is a critical aspect of advanced language models:\n\n- **Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: SSMs excel in capturing relationships between distant words, enhancing the model's ability to understand nuanced meanings. This is achieved through their ability to model complex dependencies effectively.\n\n- **Selective State Compression**: Techniques like selective state compression in SSMs enable efficient memory usage while maintaining the ability to handle long-range dependencies. This is particularly important for models that need to process long sequences[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Chrono Initialization and Gate Diversity**: Novel gating mechanisms and initialization methods, such as chrono initialization, improve the learning of temporal patterns and enhance the model's ability to handle long-term dependencies[Analysis Note].\n\n## Methods for Combining Different Architectural Components Efficiently\n\nCombining different architectural components efficiently is crucial for achieving better overall performance:\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: The Taipan model combines the Mamba-2 State Space Model with Selective Attention Layers, demonstrating how hybrid architectures can balance efficiency and performance. This approach extends accurate predictions to long context lengths while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and its variant SDLoRA (Selective Dimension tuning LoRA) are effective for fine-tuning SSM-based models. These methods selectively update certain channels and states, optimizing the performance of the combined architecture.\n\n- **Integration with Attention Mechanisms**: Integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms, as proposed by Peng et al., opens new avenues for enhancing model performance. This integration leverages the strengths of both SSMs and attention-based models to handle complex NLP tasks efficiently.\n\nBy leveraging these advances and techniques, researchers can design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that handle long-range dependencies effectively and are optimized for hardware efficiency.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.93)\n\n*Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) call for extension of context to handle many critical applications. However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

It's Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Chris Donahue, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling, is proposed, identifying that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and providing a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Raunaq M. Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Devising learning paradigms and architectures that allow machines to learn world models that operate at multiple levels of temporal abstractions while dealing with complex uncertainty predictions is a major technical hurdle. In this work, we propose a probabilistic formalism to learn multi-time scale world models which we call the Multi Time Scale State Space (MTS3) model. Our model uses a computationally efficient inference scheme on multiple time scales for highly accurate long-horizon predictions and uncertainty estimates over several seconds into the future. Our experiments, which focus on action conditional long horizon future predictions, show that MTS3 outperforms recent methods on several system identification benchmarks including complex simulated and real-world dynamical systems.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. MambaCSR: Dual-Interleaved Scanning for Compressed Image Super-Resolution With SSMs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression state space models multi-scale*\n\n*Zhibo Chen, Shijie Zhao, Bingchen Li, Mengxi Guo, Xin Li, Yulin Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task.

This approach allows for better handling of long-range dependencies and improves prediction accuracy across various tasks. For example, **Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling** by Bhirangi et al. demonstrates how HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models like causal Transformers and Mamba on MSE.\n\n## Selective Gating Mechanisms\n\n- Selective gating within SSMs, as seen in models like **Mamba** and **DenseMamba**, allows dynamic management of information flow based on the input context. These models enjoy fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length, improving performance on real data up to million-length sequences. The integration of selective gating with hierarchical compression could further refine this dynamic management, ensuring relevant information at different scales is effectively captured.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\n- Hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms are essential for optimizing memory access patterns and parallel processing. Models like **Hyena Hierarchy** focus on these optimizations, which can be integrated with hierarchical compression to maintain or enhance computational efficiency. For instance, the use of linear transformers with learnable kernel functions can improve in-context learning abilities and overall language modeling performance while being hardware-efficient.\n\n## Performance and Efficiency Gains\n\n- The combination of hierarchical compression and selective gating within SSMs can lead to significant performance and efficiency gains. For example, **MambaCSR** introduces an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm for compressed image super-resolution using SSMs, which leverages hierarchical scanning strategies to capture contextual information effectively while reducing computational costs.\n\n## Key References\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n- **Bhirangi, R.

Through an iterative search process, it has been identified that while selective gating within SSMs has been effectively employed in models like **Mamba** and **DenseMamba** to achieve linear time complexity and enhanced performance on long sequences, the explicit incorporation of hierarchical compression remains relatively unexplored. Hierarchical compression could enable multi-scale state representations, allowing the model to capture dependencies at various levels more effectively without significant memory overhead. Additionally, the focus on hardware-efficient linear attention aligns with recent trends aiming to optimize memory access patterns and parallel processing, as seen in models like **Hyena Hierarchy**. The integration of these components suggests potential improvements in scalability, efficiency, and performance. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm the novelty of this integration and to assess its impact on key performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, computational efficiency, and scalability compared to existing state-of-the-art models.\n\n2. **All useful references with excerpts.**\n\n   **Internal Sources:**\n\n   1. **Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces**\n      - *Albert Gu, Tri Dao (2023)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 662\n      - **Excerpt:** \"We identify that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrate selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

This approach can enhance the model's ability to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies, which is crucial for language modeling tasks that require understanding context over varying lengths.\n\n   - **Performance and Efficiency Gains:**\n     Models that incorporate hierarchical structures within SSMs, such as **HiSS** and **MambaCSR**, have shown improvements in performance metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and classification accuracy while maintaining or enhancing computational efficiency. This suggests that hierarchical compression can lead to more expressive and scalable models without significant trade-offs in speed or memory consumption.\n\n   - **Selective Gating Mechanisms:**\n     The use of selective gating within SSMs, as exemplified by **Mamba** and **DenseMamba**, allows the model to dynamically manage information flow based on the input context. Integrating hierarchical compression with selective gating could further refine this dynamic management, ensuring that relevant information at different scales is effectively captured and utilized.\n\n   - **Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention:**\n     Emphasizing hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms, as seen in models like **Hyena Hierarchy**, aligns with the goal of optimizing memory access patterns and parallel processing. Combining this with hierarchical compression can potentially yield models that are both highly performant and computationally efficient, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\n   - **Novelty of HybridStateGate:**\n     While existing models have successfully integrated selective gating within SSMs and explored multi-scale representations, the explicit combination of hierarchical compression with selective gating in SSMs appears to be a novel contribution. This unique integration could offer enhanced capabilities in capturing complex linguistic dependencies and improving overall model performance.\n\n   - **Comparative Benchmarking:**\n     The benchmark performances of models like **Mamba**, **DenseMamba**, **HiSS**, and **MambaCSR** against traditional Transformers indicate that SSM-based architectures can achieve competitive or superior results while offering computational benefits. **HybridStateGate** aims to build upon these advancements by introducing hierarchical compression, which may further lower perplexity and improve accuracy on downstream tasks.\n\n   - **Potential Challenges:**\n     - **Integration Complexity:** Combining hierarchical compression with selective gating within SSMs may introduce architectural complexities, requiring careful design to maintain both efficiency and performance.\n     - **Training Stability:** Hierarchical structures might complicate the training dynamics, necessitating advanced optimization techniques to ensure stable and effective learning.\n     - **Hardware Optimization:** Ensuring that hierarchical compression and selective gating mechanisms are optimized for specific hardware architectures may require additional engineering efforts.\n\n   -

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DenseSSM is introduced, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, and retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: HybridStateGate state space models selective gating\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: HybridStateGate state space models selective gating*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 215  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 4.

The detailed mechanism underlying this process is largely unknown and the ability to mimic this procedure is an important problem in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. We consider the problem of decoding the attentional state of a listener in a competing-speaker environment from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings from the human brain. We develop a behaviorally inspired state-space model to account for the modulation of the MEG with respect to attentional state of the listener. We construct a decoder based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the state parameters via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The resulting decoder is able to track the attentional modulation of the listener with multi-second resolution using only the envelopes of the two speech streams as covariates. We present simulation studies as well as application to real MEG data from two human subjects. Our results reveal that the proposed decoder provides substantial gains in terms of temporal resolution, complexity, and decoding accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

As a specific case, we consider estimating the Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the average discrepancy between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples. Furthermore, we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately and detecting mislabeled examples without expensive iterations over the entire dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **HybridStateGate**, that integrates state space models (SSMs) with selective gating and hierarchical compression, and utilizes hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms, here are some key steps and information sources that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Existing Architectures and Concepts\n\n1. **State Space Models (SSMs) in LMs:**\n   - A key paper to consider is \"State Space LSTM\" by Wu et al.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 274  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 2.

Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient.

This integration aims to address common challenges in large language models, including the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, inefficient handling of long-range dependencies, high memory consumption, and suboptimal hardware utilization. Initial research revealed that several existing models, such as Mamba and DenseMamba, utilize SSMs with selective gating mechanisms to achieve linear time complexity and improved performance on long sequences. However, none of these models explicitly incorporate hierarchical compression. Additionally, recent advancements like Hyena demonstrate efficient, attention-free architectures that prioritize hardware efficiency. The HybridStateGate's unique combination of hierarchical compression and hardware-efficient linear attention suggests potential improvements in model scalability and efficiency. Further investigation is required to confirm its novelty and assess its impact on accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability compared to current state-of-the-art models.\n\n2. **All useful references with excerpts.**\n\n   **Internal Sources:**\n\n   1. **Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces**\n      - *Albert Gu, Tri Dao (2023)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 662\n      - **Excerpt:** \"We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning... we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode.\"\n\n   2. **DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models**\n      - *Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang (2024)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 14\n      - **Excerpt:** \"By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\"\n\n   3. **You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet**\n      - *Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai (2024)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 1\n      - **Excerpt:** \"This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence...\"\n\n   4. **HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion**\n      - *Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong (2024)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 11\n      - **Excerpt:** \"This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters.\"\n\n   5. **Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DenseSSM is introduced, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, and retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

(2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field.

It's Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale hierarchical compression state space models*\n\n*Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Chris Donahue, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling, is proposed, identifying that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and providing a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale hierarchical compression state space models*\n\n*Raunaq M. Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Devising learning paradigms and architectures that allow machines to learn world models that operate at multiple levels of temporal abstractions while dealing with complex uncertainty predictions is a major technical hurdle. In this work, we propose a probabilistic formalism to learn multi-time scale world models which we call the Multi Time Scale State Space (MTS3) model. Our model uses a computationally efficient inference scheme on multiple time scales for highly accurate long-horizon predictions and uncertainty estimates over several seconds into the future. Our experiments, which focus on action conditional long horizon future predictions, show that MTS3 outperforms recent methods on several system identification benchmarks including complex simulated and real-world dynamical systems.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale hierarchical compression state space models*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale hierarchical compression state space models*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. MambaCSR: Dual-Interleaved Scanning for Compressed Image Super-Resolution With SSMs\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale hierarchical compression state space models*\n\n*Zhibo Chen, Shijie Zhao, Bingchen Li, Mengxi Guo, Xin Li, Yulin Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task.

This encoder captures features at varying time scales, which could be translated to capturing linguistic dependencies at different levels in language models. For instance, the hierarchical encoder in MsCodec uses multiple convolutional modules to encode speech features at different scales, which could be analogous to encoding linguistic features at various temporal scales.\n\n- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: The use of multi-scale feature extraction in other domains, such as HSI-LiDAR data classification, demonstrates the effectiveness of capturing features at multiple scales to improve classification accuracy. This principle can be applied to language models to enhance their ability to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies.\n\n- **Multi-Hierarchical Complementary Feature Interaction**: The MHCFIN model for multi-modal image reconstruction uses a dual-branch encoder-decoder structure with multi-attention mechanisms to capture key features at different levels. This approach can inspire the design of a multi-scale hierarchical compression mechanism within SSMs, ensuring that the model captures and integrates features from different scales effectively.\n\n### Integration with State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **State Space Models with Selective Gating**: Models like Mamba and DenseMamba have successfully integrated selective gating within SSMs to achieve linear time complexity and competitive performance. However, these models do not explicitly incorporate hierarchical compression. The HybridStateGate proposal aims to fill this gap by integrating hierarchical compression, which could enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies at various levels.\n\n- **Hierarchical State Space Models**: The concept of hierarchical state space models (HiSS) for continuous sequence-to-sequence modeling suggests stacking structured state-space models to create a temporal hierarchy. This approach can be adapted to incorporate hierarchical compression, allowing the model to manage state information at various temporal scales efficiently.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\n- **Efficient Linear Attention Mechanisms**: The focus on hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms is crucial for scalability and efficiency. Models like those discussed in the context of HSI-LiDAR classification and multi-modal image reconstruction highlight the importance of optimizing computational complexity and memory usage. Integrating hierarchical compression with these mechanisms can further enhance the model's efficiency.\n\n### Key Insights and Analysis\n\n- **Novelty and Potential Benefits**: The integration of hierarchical compression within SSMs is a novel approach that could significantly enhance the model's capacity to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies. This could lead to improved performance in terms of perplexity, accuracy, and robustness.\n\n- **Performance Enhancements**: By managing state information at multiple scales, the model can better handle diverse linguistic structures and dependencies, potentially outperforming existing SSMs and Transformer models.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The use of hierarchical compression and hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms can optimize memory access patterns and parallel processing, enhancing the model's scalability and efficiency.\n\n- **Challenges and Future Directions**:\n  - Ensuring that the integration of hierarchical compression does not negate the efficiency gains from selective gating and linear attention.\n  - Maintaining training stability and smooth integration with hardware-efficient components.\n  - Conducting comprehensive benchmarking to validate the HybridStateGate's effectiveness against existing models.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Round 4: Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Compression in Sequence Models**\n  - Refine search queries to include terms like \"multi-scale state space models,\" \"hierarchical compression in neural networks,\" and \"multi-resolution sequence modeling.\"\n  - Explore related fields such as computer vision and signal processing to identify transferable methodologies.\n\n- **Round 5: Hardware-Efficient Implementations and Optimizations**\n  - Search for the latest implementations of hardware-optimized linear attention and their integration with state space models.\n  - Investigate how hierarchical compression can be optimized for modern hardware architectures.\n\n- **Round 6: Comparative Performance Studies**\n  - Gather benchmarking studies that compare hierarchical compression-augmented models against standard SSMs and Transformers.\n  - Identify performance trade-offs or benefits associated with incorporating hierarchical compression.\n\n### References\n\n- **MsCodec**: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Encoder for speech compression.\n- **HSI-LiDAR Classification**: Multi-scale feature extraction and fusion methods.\n- **MHCFIN**: Multi-hierarchical complementary feature interaction network for image reconstruction.\n- **Mamba and DenseMamba**: State space models with selective gating.\n- **Hierarchical State Space Models**: HiSS for continuous sequence-to-sequence modeling.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient language model that leverages the strengths of hierarchical compression and state space models, while ensuring hardware efficiency through linear attention mechanisms.\n",

The initial searches have identified that while recent models like Mamba and DenseMamba effectively incorporate selective gating within SSMs to achieve linear time complexity and competitive performance, the explicit incorporation of hierarchical compression within SSMs remains unexplored. Introducing hierarchical compression could enable multi-scale state representations, allowing the model to capture dependencies at various levels more effectively without incurring significant memory overhead. Additionally, the focus on hardware-efficient linear attention aligns with current research trends aiming to enhance scalability and efficiency in large language models. Further investigation is required to confirm the novelty of combining hierarchical compression with SSMs and to assess its impact on accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n2. **All useful references with excerpts.**\n\n   **Internal Sources:**\n\n   1. **Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces**\n      - *Albert Gu, Tri Dao (2023)*\n      - **Published in:** arXiv.org\n      - **Cited by:** 662\n      - **Excerpt:** \"We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning...

This suggests that HybridStateGate could fill a unique niche by enabling multi-scale state representations, potentially enhancing the model's ability to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies efficiently.\n\n   - **Performance Enhancements through Multi-Scale Representations:** Hierarchical compression could allow HybridStateGate to manage state information at various temporal scales, improving the model's capacity to handle diverse linguistic structures and dependencies without a significant increase in computational overhead.\n\n   - **Alignment with Hardware-Efficient Designs:** The emphasis on hardware-aware linear attention mechanisms in HybridStateGate aligns with recent advancements like Hyena Hierarchy and Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers. Integrating hierarchical compression with these mechanisms could further optimize memory access patterns and parallel processing, enhancing scalability and efficiency.\n\n   - **Benchmarking Against State-of-the-Art Models:** Models like H3 and Mamba-2 demonstrate that refinements in SSM architectures can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding that of traditional Transformers while maintaining superior computational efficiency. HybridStateGate's unique combination of hierarchical compression and selective gating could potentially surpass these benchmarks if effectively implemented.\n\n   - **Potential Challenges in Integration:** Incorporating hierarchical compression within SSMs may introduce complexities in state management and computational overhead. Ensuring that hierarchical compression does not negate the efficiency gains from selective gating and linear attention will be crucial. Additionally, maintaining training stability and ensuring smooth integration with hardware-efficient components will be key areas to address.\n\n   - **Need for Comprehensive Benchmarking:** To validate HybridStateGate's effectiveness, extensive benchmarking against existing SSMs and Transformer models is necessary. Metrics should include perplexity, accuracy on diverse NLP tasks, computational efficiency (both training and inference), and scalability with increasing model sizes and sequence lengths.\n\n   - **Interdisciplinary Inspirations:** Exploring hierarchical compression techniques from related fields such as computer vision or signal processing might offer innovative methodologies that can be adapted to enhance HybridStateGate's design.

    "abstract": "We propose HybridStateGate, a novel language model block that combines state space models with selective gating and hierarchical compression. The design leverages hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms and introduces a novel state management system that enables efficient handling of long-range dependencies. By integrating selective state compression with adaptive gating, HybridStateGate achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness. The architecture is designed to be hardware-aware, with optimized memory access patterns and efficient parallel processing capabilities.",
