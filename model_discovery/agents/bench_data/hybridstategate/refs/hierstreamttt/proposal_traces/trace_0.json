One particular type of such attention, called multi-head scaled dot-product attention, is one of the main components of the Transformer architecture proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017), which has been shown to push the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for various understanding and generation tasks. These include standard natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, document classification, entailment, summarization and question answering (Zaheer et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019; Baevski and Auli, 2019), as well as music generation (Huang et al., 2018), image generation (Parmar et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020) and genomics (Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020). The Transformer is also the backbone architecture for models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) (and its numerous relatives) and GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), which have delivered impressive performance across many NLP tasks. However, the standard attention mechanism of the Transformer has a run time and memory usage that scales quadratically with sequence length. Therefore, this quadratic complexity has become a critical bottleneck in processing long sequences (over 1,000 tokens), and has since motivated many new attention algorithms, see (Tay et al., 2020d) for a survey of such work. In this paper, we draw inspiration from two branches in numerical analysis: Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000) and Multigrid method (Briggs et al., 2000). We propose a hierarchical attention that has linear complexity in run time and memory, and only utilizes dense linear algebra operations optimized for GPUs or TPUs. We hypothesize that the inductive bias embodied by the proposed hierarchical structure for the attention matrix is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typically seen in many natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The main benchmark we use in this paper is the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020c), which has been specifically designed to evaluate and compare various sub-quadratic attention algorithms. Our new hierarchical attention mechanism achieves best average performance to-date on the LRA benchmark by more than 6 points over the previous-best BigBird algorithm (Zaheer et al., 2020), while pushing SOTA performance higher\nin 4 of the 5 successful tasks. Furthermore, using this new attention, a Transformer-based language model trained on the One-Billion Word dataset (Chelba et al., 2014) sets a new SOTA performance record by reducing the test perplexity by 1.55 points comparing to the previousbest Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) with 5x more parameters. Overall, these empirical results both validate the soundness of our approximation method for computing attention weights, as well as the the appropriateness of the inductive bias present in the proposed hierarchical attention. ## 2 Related Works\n\nIt is well established in the NLP literature that the embeddings of nearby tokens tend to be more similar than the distant ones (Manning and Sch\u00fctze, 1999). This leads to the intuition that token similarity and hence the attention should decrease with the sequence distance between a query token and a key token ${ }^{1}$. This motivates the sliding-window local attention (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019) which amounts to truncating off-diagonal entries in the attention matrix beyond a user-specified sequence distance. A second approach is to keep $O(1)$ number of nonzeros per row in the attention matrix. The nonzero entry selection is either content-based (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020), handcrafted (Beltagy et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019) or simply random (Zaheer et al., 2020). It is also well known in the NLP literature that long-range contextual information is necessary for many NLP tasks (Khandelwal et al., 2018; Liu and Lapata, 2019). So a set of global tokens are also considered. This adds $O(1)$ number of dense rows and columns to the attention matrix (Zaheer et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). A third approach is to approximate the attention matrix with a lowrank factored form (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a). The first two approaches are based on the premise that one needs to explicitly zero out entries in the attention matrix in order to reduce the quadratic complexity. Decades of\n\n[^0]research by the scientific computing and numerical analysis community has resulted in more sophisticated algorithms to sparsify matrices. A small set of samples of these algorithms and their engineering applications include Fast Multipole Method (Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987; Greengard, 1994; Nabors et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1998), Pre-corrected FFT (Phillips and White, 1997; Zhu et al., 2005), Hierarchical Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Kapur and Long, 1997) and Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) (Hackbusch, 1999, 2000; Zhu and White, 2005). These are generally called Multilevel Methods (Brandt and Lubrecht, 1990). The hierarchical attention proposed in this paper is inspired by these Multilevel Methods in general and the H-Matrix in particular. The hierarchical matrix structure allows a linear complexity in both constructing and applying the attention matrix. ## 3 Definition and Notation\n\nGiven matrices $Q, K$ and $V$, with rows representing sequences of token embedding or feature vectors for query, key and value respectively, the output weighted by the scaled dot-product attention in the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is defined as\n\n$$\nZ=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $Z, Q, K, V \\in R^{L \\times d}, L$ is the length of the sequences, and $d$ is the embedding or feature size. In a more compact matrix form, Eq. (1) can be written as\n\n$$\nZ=D^{-1} A V\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA & =e^{S} \\\\\nS_{i, j} & =\\frac{Q_{i} K_{j}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}} \\\\\nD & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left\\{A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}\\right\\} \\\\\n1_{L} & =[1,1, \\ldots, 1]^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $A, S \\in R^{L \\times L}, \\mathbf{1}_{L} \\in R^{L}$ is a vector with all ones, and $S_{i, j}$ represents the unnormalized cosine similarity between query embedding $Q_{i}$ (the $i$-th row in $Q$ ) and key embedding $K_{j}$ (the $j$-th row in $K)$. For the sake of clarity, we focus on the singlehead attention in the exposition of the proposed\nalgorithm. Extension to the multi-head case is straightforward since each attention head is computed independently (Vaswani et al., 2017). Computing the similarity matrix $S$ in Eq. (4) and the attention matrix $A$ in Eq. (3) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ memory. Similarly, computing $A V$ in Eq. (2) takes $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ time, and computing $A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{L}$ in Eq. (5) takes $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ time. The $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ and $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexities are the bottlenecks for applying the attention mechanism over very long sequences. ## 4 Introduction on H-Matrix and Multigrid Method\n\n### 4.1 H-Matrix\n\nThe singular-value decomposition of the attention matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.47)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Attention with Bounded-memory Control (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Hao Peng, Jungo Kasai, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Zhaofeng Wu, Lingpeng Kong, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/39 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\n4. \u00a7B. 2 presents a detailed derivation. Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n#### 4. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 227  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

The language model, pre-trained on texts of length $L$, predicts the $T$ th token $(T \\gg L)$. (a) Dense Attention has $O\\left(T^{2}\\right)$ time complexity and an increasing cache size. Its performance decreases when the text length exceeds the pre-training text length. (b) Window Attention caches the most recent $L$ tokens' KV. While efficient in inference, performance declines sharply once the starting tokens' keys and values are evicted. (c) Sliding Window with Re-computation rebuilds the KV states from the $L$ recent tokens for each new token. While it performs well on long texts, its $O\\left(T L^{2}\\right)$ complexity, stemming from quadratic attention in context re-computation, makes it considerably slow. (d) StreamingLLM keeps the attention sink (several initial tokens) for stable attention computation, combined with the recent tokens. It's efficient and offers stable performance on extended texts. Perplexities are measured using the Llama-2-13B model on the first book ( 65 K tokens) in the PG-19 test set. When applying LLMs for infinite input streams, two primary challenges arise:\n\n1. During the decoding stage, Transformer-based LLMs cache the Key and Value states (KV) of all previous tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a), which can lead to excessive memory usage and increasing decoding latency (Pope et al., 2022). 2. Existing models have limited length extrapolation abilities, i.e., their performance degrades (Press et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023) when the sequence length goes beyond the attention window size set during pre-training. An intuitive approach, known as window attention (Beltagy et al. 2020) (Figure 1 b), maintains only a fixed-size sliding window on the KV states of most recent tokens. Although it ensures constant memory usage and decoding speed after the cache is initially filled, the model collapses once the sequence length exceeds the cache size, i.e., even just evicting the $K V$ of the first token, as illustrated in Figure 3 Another strategy is the sliding window with re-computation (shown in Figure 11c), which rebuilds the KV states of recent tokens for each generated token. While it offers strong performance, this approach is significantly slower due to the computation of quadratic attention within its window, making this method impractical for real-world streaming applications. To understand the failure of window attention, we find an interesting phenomenon of autoregressive LLMs: a surprisingly large amount of attention score is allocated to the initial tokens, irrespective of their relevance to the language modeling task, as visualized in Figure 2. We term these tokens \"attention sinks\". Despite their lack of semantic significance, they collect significant attention scores. We attribute the reason to the Softmax operation, which requires attention scores to sum up to one for all contextual tokens. Thus, even when the current query does not have a strong match in many previous tokens, the model still needs to allocate these unneeded attention values somewhere so it sums up to one. The reason behind initial tokens as sink tokens is intuitive: initial tokens are visible to almost all subsequent tokens because of the autoregressive language modeling nature, making them more readily trained to serve as attention sinks. Based on the above insights, we propose StreamingLLM, a simple and efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite attention window to work on text of infinite length without finetuning. StreamingLLM exploits the fact that attention sinks have high attention values, and preserving them can maintain the attention score distribution close to normal. Therefore, StreamingLLM simply keeps the attention sink tokens' KV (with just 4 initial tokens sufficing) together with the sliding window's KV to anchor the attention computation and stabilize the model's performance. With StreamingLLM, models including Llama-2-[7, 13, 70]B, MPT-[7, 30]B, Falcon-[7, 40]B, and Pythia[2.9,6.9,12]B can reliably model 4 million tokens, and potentially even more. Compared with the only viable baseline, sliding window with recomputation, StreamingLLM achieves up to $22.2 \\times$ speedup, realizing the streaming use of LLMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_c4d42a88c0df416625cag-03.jpg?height=315&width=1335&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=384)\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of the average attention logits in Llama-2-7B over 256 sentences, each with a length of 16. Observations include: (1) The attention maps in the first two layers (layers 0 and 1 ) exhibit the \"local\" pattern, with recent tokens receiving more attention. (2) Beyond the bottom two layers, the model heavily attends to the initial token across all layers and heads. Furthermore, we confirm our attention sink hypothesis and demonstrate that language models can be pre-trained to require only a single attention sink token for streaming deployment. Specifically, we suggest that an extra learnable token at the beginning of all training samples can serve as a designated attention sink. By pre-training 160-million parameter language models from scratch, we demonstrate that adding this single sink token preserves the model's performance in streaming cases. This stands in contrast to vanilla models, which necessitate the reintroduction of multiple initial tokens as attention sinks to achieve the same performance level. Finally, we emphasize that StreamingLLM efficiently generates coherent text from tokens within the KV cache without extending the LLMs' context length. It suits continuous operation needs with minimal memory use and past data reliance. Additionally, StreamingLLM can complement context extension methods to increase the attendable recent context. ## 2 RELATEd WORK\n\nExtensive research has been done on applying LLMs to lengthy texts, with three main areas of focus: Length Extrapolation, Context Window Extension, and Improving LLMs' Utilization of Long Text. While seemingly related, it's worth noting that progress in one direction doesn't necessarily lead to progress in the other. For example, extending the context size of LLMs doesn't improve the model's performance beyond the context size, and neither approach ensures effective use of the long context. Our StreamingLLM framework primarily lies in the first category, where LLMs are applied to text significantly exceeding the pre-training window size, potentially even of infinite length. We do not expand the attention window size of LLMs or enhance the model's memory and usage on long texts. The last two categories are orthogonal to our focus and could be integrated with our techniques. Length extrapolation aims to enable language models trained on shorter texts to handle longer ones during testing. A predominant avenue of research targets the development of relative position encoding methods for Transformer models, enabling them to function beyond their training window. One such initiative is Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which transforms the queries and keys in every attention layer for relative position integration. Despite its promise, subsequent research (Press et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023) indicated its underperformance on text that exceeds the training window. Another approach, $\\overline{A L i B i}$ (Press et al., 2022), biases the query-key attention scores based on their distance, thereby introducing relative positional information. While this exhibited improved extrapolation, our tests on MPT models highlighted a breakdown when the text length was vastly greater than the training length. Current methodologies, however, have yet to achieve infinite length extrapolation, causing no existing LLMs to fit for streaming applications.

Score: 0.14)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them.

STREAMER: Streaming Representation Learning and Event Segmentation in a Hierarchical Manner\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*R. Mounir, Sujal Vijayaraghavan, Sudeep Sarkar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel self-supervised approach for hierarchical representation learning and segmentation of perceptual inputs in a streaming fashion, and proposes STREAMER, an architecture that is trained layer-by-layer, adapting to the complexity of the input domain.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel self-supervised approach for hierarchical representation learning and segmentation of perceptual inputs in a streaming fashion. Our research addresses how to semantically group streaming inputs into chunks at various levels of a hierarchy while simultaneously learning, for each chunk, robust global representations throughout the domain. To achieve this, we propose STREAMER, an architecture that is trained layer-by-layer, adapting to the complexity of the input domain. In our approach, each layer is trained with two primary objectives: making accurate predictions into the future and providing necessary information to other levels for achieving the same objective. The event hierarchy is constructed by detecting prediction error peaks at different levels, where a detected boundary triggers a bottom-up information flow. At an event boundary, the encoded representation of inputs at one layer becomes the input to a higher-level layer. Additionally, we design a communication module that facilitates top-down and bottom-up exchange of information during the prediction process. Notably, our model is fully self-supervised and trained in a streaming manner, enabling a single pass on the training data. This means that the model encounters each input only once and does not store the data. We evaluate the performance of our model on the egocentric EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, specifically focusing on temporal event segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct event retrieval experiments using the learned representations to demonstrate the high quality of our video event representations.

Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*Brian DuSell, David Chiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty and is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention, specifically scaled dot-product attention, has proven effective for natural language, but it does not have a mechanism for handling hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth, which limits its ability to recognize certain syntactic structures. To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget, and we include results on machine translation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learnable Multi-level Frequency Decomposition and Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*Arjan Kuijper, Florian Kirchbuchner, Naser Damer, Meiling Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increased deployment of face recognition systems in our daily lives, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is attracting much attention and playing a key role in securing face recognition systems. Despite the great performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks (CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain adaption/shift problems. We successfully prove the design of our proposed PAD solution in a step-wise ablation study that involves our proposed learnable frequency decomposition, our hierarchical attention module design, and the used loss function.

Event Stream-based Visual Object Tracking: A High-Resolution Benchmark Dataset and A Novel Baseline\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, Bo Jiang, Lin Zhu, Chuanming Tang, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has drawn more and more attention in recent years. Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The first category needs more cost for inference and the second one may be easily influenced by noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge transfer, enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking during testing by using only event signals. Specifically, a teacher Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then, we design a new hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise similarity, feature representation, and response maps-based knowledge distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. Moreover, since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution ($346 \\times 260$), we propose the first large-scale high-resolution ($1280 \\times 720$) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide range of categories such as pedestrians, vehicles, UAVs, ping pongs, etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT), and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Motion-Attentive Transition for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical streaming attention*\n\n*Tianfei Zhou, Yazhou Yao, Shunzhou Wang, Jianwu Li, Yi Zhou, Ling Shao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a novel Motion-Attentive Transition Network (MATNet) for zero-shot video object segmentation, which provides a new way of leveraging motion information to reinforce spatio-temporal object representation. An asymmetric attention block, called Motion-Attentive Transition (MAT), is designed within a two-stream encoder, which transforms appearance features into motion-attentive representations at each convolutional stage. In this way, the encoder becomes deeply interleaved, allowing for closely hierarchical interactions between object motion and appearance. This is superior to the typical two-stream architecture, which treats motion and appearance separately in each stream and often suffers from overfitting to appearance information. Additionally, a bridge network is proposed to obtain a compact, discriminative and scale-sensitive representation for multi-level encoder features, which is further fed into a decoder to achieve segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e. DAVIS-16, FBMS and Youtube-Objects) show that our model achieves compelling performance against the state-of-the-arts.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design by combining hierarchical processing with streaming attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and techniques that can be leveraged:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\nThe concept of hierarchical processing can be drawn from the hierarchical reinforcement learning approach described in. This approach involves breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks using a hierarchy of policy networks. For language models, this could translate to processing input sequences at multiple levels of abstraction, where higher-level policies can decompose tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This hierarchical structure can help in efficient feature representation and test-time adaptation.\n\n## Streaming Attention Mechanisms\nThe \"DuoAttention\" mechanism described in is particularly relevant here. It categorizes attention heads into \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads\":\n- **Retrieval Heads**: These heads maintain a full Key-Value (KV) cache to capture and retain important long-term context information.\n- **Streaming Heads**: These heads use a reduced, constant-length cache to manage short-term dependencies and recent tokens, reducing memory usage.\n\n### Integration Techniques\nTo combine hierarchical processing with streaming attention, consider the following strategies:\n\n### Hierarchical Streaming Attention\n- Implement streaming attention sinks at each scale level of the hierarchical structure. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies efficiently while forgetting less critical tokens.\n- Use scale-specific compression ratios based on the importance of the information at each level. This can be achieved through adaptive pruning and dynamic allocation of memory resources.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Multi-Scale Processing\n- Utilize a full KV cache for Retrieval Heads at higher levels of the hierarchy to maintain long-term context, and a reduced KV cache for Streaming Heads at lower levels to manage short-term dependencies.\n- Apply adaptive computation paths to optimize resource usage across different scales. This involves dynamic pruning and adaptive computation to ensure that only critical heads receive full resources.\n\n### Test-Time Adaptation in Streaming Contexts\n- Apply test-time adaptation hierarchically, allowing the model to adapt at different scales independently. This can enhance the model's ability to handle varying contexts and input lengths.\n\n## Implementation Details\n- **Attention Head Classification**: During implementation, classify attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming types based on their roles in context management. This can be determined through training and evaluation cycles using synthetic data.\n- **Key-Value (KV) Cache Management**: Manage KV caches dynamically, allocating full caches to Retrieval Heads and reduced caches to Streaming Heads. This ensures efficient memory usage while retaining crucial context information.\n- **Optimization-Based Identification**: Use optimization-based methods to identify the most critical attention heads and allocate resources accordingly. This involves generating synthetic data to simulate various contexts and evaluating the impact of each attention head on overall model accuracy.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, the researchers can develop an autoregressive LM that leverages hierarchical processing for efficient feature representation and test-time adaptation, while utilizing streaming attention mechanisms to manage memory efficiently and handle long contexts effectively.\n",

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nThis method stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. - Our SinkLoRA performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate its performance on the PG19, Proof-pile, and LongBench datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-04.jpg?height=375&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Segmentation and Reassembly process in SF-Attn. The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs. A cost-effective method for KV cache compression is token dropping [25, 43, 16], which establishes an importance policy to retain significant KVs and remove insignificant ones.\n```\n\n#### 3.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Score: 0.15)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/38 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nThis ensures an accurate profiling of the attention influences to facilitate better compression results. Our contributions are summarized as follows. - Heterogeneous Elastic Rules. We propose heterogeneous elastic rules for masks of each attention head. We formulate MoA compression search space to include a diverse range of elastic rules that tailor the local attention span relative to the input length for each attention head. The heterogeneous elastic rules improve the fact retrieval accuracy of MoA from 25\\% to $98 \\%$ compared with masks with uniform span and scaling function for each head. - Calibration Dataset Construction We emphasize the importance of data engineering in LLM compression. Our findings demonstrate that using datasets with long-range dependencies and referencing the original LLM's responses are crucial for accurately profiling the influences of compression. - Automatic Optimization. We propose an automatic pipeline to find the optimal compression plan encompassing heterogeneous elastic rules for various attention heads. This pipeline can efficiently find the optimal plan within several hours, for example, two hours for compressing Vicuna-13B. Experiments show that MoA achieves $5.5 \\times$ to $6.7 \\times$ throughput improvements on 7 B and 13 B dense LLMs at a $50 \\%$ density (the average of KV-Cache length / input length), with only $1 \\%$ average relative degradation in retrieval accuracy. Additionally, MoA achieves over $90 \\%$ retrieval accuracy with just $25 \\%$ average density, far surpassing sparse attention baselines that need a density of $75 \\%$ to $100 \\%$ for similar performance. On long-context understanding benchmarks, MoA performs comparably to dense models, with a maximum relative performance drop of less than $5 \\%$, which is about one-sixth of that observed with the uniform sparse attention baseline.

Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression streaming attention*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Residual Non-local Attention Networks for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression streaming attention*\n\n*Yulun Zhang, Kunpeng Li, Kai Li, Bineng Zhong, Y. Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network is generalized for various image restoration applications, such as image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a residual non-local attention network for high-quality image restoration. Without considering the uneven distribution of information in the corrupted images, previous methods are restricted by local convolutional operation and equal treatment of spatial- and channel-wise features. To address this issue, we design local and non-local attention blocks to extract features that capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and pay more attention to the challenging parts. Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network, which further enhance the representation ability of the network. Our proposed method can be generalized for various image restoration applications, such as image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution.

CLaM-TTS: Improving Neural Codec Language Model for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression streaming attention*\n\n*Jaehyeon Kim, Keon Lee, Seungjun Chung, Jaewoong Cho*\n\n**TL;DR:** CLaM-TTS is presented that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to achieve superior compression in the token length, and allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams.\n\n**Abstract:** With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed.

MG-ViT: A Multi-Granularity Method for Compact and Efficient Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression streaming attention*\n\n*Yu Zhang, Yepeng Liu, Duoqian Miao, Qi Zhang, Yiwei Shi, Liang Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A two-stage multi-granularity framework, MG-ViT, is proposed to balance ViT\u2019s performance and computational cost and extends the multi-granularity strategy to hierarchical ViT for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) faces obstacles in wide application due to its huge computational cost. Almost all existing studies on compressing ViT adopt the manner of splitting an image with a single granularity, with very few exploration of splitting an image with multi-granularity. As we know, important information often randomly concentrate in few regions of an image, necessitating multi-granularity attention allocation to an image. Enlightened by this, we introduce the multi-granularity strategy to compress ViT, which is simple but effective. We propose a two-stage multi-granularity framework, MG-ViT, to balance ViT\u2019s performance and computational cost. In single-granularity inference stage, an input image is split into a small number of patches for simple inference. If necessary, multi-granularity inference stage will be instigated, where the important patches are further subsplit into multi-finer-grained patches for subsequent inference. Moreover, prior studies on compression only for classification, while we extend the multi-granularity strategy to hierarchical ViT for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. Extensive experiments Prove the effectiveness of the multi-granularity strategy. For instance, on ImageNet, without any loss of performance, MG-ViT reduces 47% FLOPs of LV-ViT-S and 56% FLOPs of DeiT-S.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression streaming attention*\n\n*Jang-Hyun Kim, Junyoung Yeom, Sangdoo Yun, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer language models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As the context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and computations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To address this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a lightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during inference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights. We achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as a single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation, personalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller context memory size. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the sliding window approach.

This approach uses a hierarchical matrix structure to capture the hierarchical structure in sequences efficiently.\n- **FasterViT** employs Hierarchical Attention (HAT) to decompose global attention, which can be adapted for language models to handle hierarchical patterns efficiently.\n\n### Streaming Attention Mechanisms\n- **StreamingLLM** introduces the concept of \"attention sinks\" which involves keeping the key-value (KV) pairs of initial tokens to recover the performance of window attention. This method significantly speeds up unbounded sequence processing by up to 22.2x compared to sliding window recomputation baselines.\n\n### Tiling and Bounded Memory Control\n- **Lightning Attention-2** uses a tiling approach to handle intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. This method retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length, which is crucial for streaming models.\n- **Attention with Bounded-memory Control (ABC)** is another approach that focuses on memory-efficient attention by controlling the memory usage, which is essential for streaming contexts.\n\n## Efficient State Management\n\n### Hierarchical Compression\n- Implementing hierarchical compression at different scales can help in managing the state efficiently. This involves applying different compression ratios at various hierarchical levels to maintain critical context while reducing memory usage.\n\n### Attention Sinks and State Transitions\n- Using attention sinks at multiple scales can help in maintaining the context across different parts of the sequence. This involves keeping the KV pairs of critical tokens to ensure continuity and efficiency in state transitions.\n\n### Adaptive Pruning Strategies\n- Exploring adaptive pruning strategies for multi-scale attention can help in reducing the computational and memory requirements. Techniques like **SynFlow** or the **lottery ticket hypothesis** can be adapted to prune less important weights or connections, thereby improving efficiency without significant performance loss.\n\n## Integration Strategy\n\n### Combining Local and Global Attention\n- Combining local and global attention through hierarchical structures can capture both short-range and long-range dependencies efficiently. This can be achieved by using hierarchical attention mechanisms that decompose global attention into local components.\n\n### Efficient State Transitions\n- Implementing efficient state transitions involves using techniques like attention sinks and bounded memory control to ensure that the model can process sequences efficiently without losing critical context. This can be done by leveraging the tiling approach and hierarchical compression ratios.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of memory and computation but also highly effective in capturing hierarchical and long-range dependencies in sequences. This approach can lead to better performance, scalability, and robustness in various NLP tasks.\n",

Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Semantic Compression (Avg.

This constraint restricts their applicability in scenarios involving long texts. We propose a novel semantic compression method that enables generalization to texts that are 6-8 times longer, without incurring significant computational costs or requiring fine-tuning. Our proposed framework draws inspiration from source coding in information theory and employs a pre-trained model to reduce the semantic redundancy of long inputs before passing them to the LLMs for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively extends the context window of LLMs across a range of tasks including question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval. Furthermore, the proposed semantic compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while reducing the associated computational overhead.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nMany methods have been proposed to decrease the complexity. Dai et al. (2019) present Transformer-XL which utilize segment-level recurrence agency and a novel positional encoding scheme. Beltagy et al. (2020) introduce Longformer with a sparse attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length. Bo (2021) provides a faster transformer, RWKV, which combines the strength of RNN and has linear complexity during inference. Dao et al. (2022) propose FlashAttention, a chunking strategy for the input, and utilize recomputation to avoid the quadratic complexity of attention computation. While these methods have the potential to handle longer input sequences (Ding et al., 2023), training new models can be costly. Moreover, these methods are not effective when dealing with out-of-distribution content lengths. The introduction of new positional embeddings requires fine-tuning on long sequences to adapt to the increased length, which can be computationally expensive. To address this, LongLoRA is introduced by Chen et al. (2023b), offering an efficient fine-tuning method with limited computational costs. More details on several other chunking strategies are provided in the survey by Huang et al. (2023). ### 2.3 PROMPTING\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to extend the context window through smart prompting designs. Wingate et al. (2022) utilize soft prompts to encode more information using fewer tokens. Chevalier et al.

(2023) recurrently apply LLMs to summarize the input texts to maintain long short-term memory for specific purposes such as story writing and dialogue generation, respectively. ## 3 METHODOLOGY\n\nWe propose our semantic compression method for extending the context window. The core idea is to compress the input into shorter texts without losing the key information and important details. This enables us to effectively include more content within the fixed input length constraint of the LLM. Fig. 2 provides an overview of our method, which leverages pre-trained summarization models commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods also have limitations regarding the length of the input. Here, we propose a divide-and-conquer based approach that takes into account the structure of the text. By identifying the topic structure of lengthy texts and dividing them into blocks that exhibit a certain level of mutual independence, the content within each block can be compressed efficiently due to their statistical correlation. Each block is then processed in parallel using pre-trained models, and the results are combined to create a condensed textual input that can be processed by the LLM. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective way of summarizing long texts by leveraging both the structure and content of the original text. ### 3.1 MODEL\n\nReal-world textual content, such as speech and book, frequently displays hierarchical structures, wherein each section is structured around a particular topic, and different sections differ in topic in a sequential manner. This hierarchical structure, based on topics, bears resemblance to cliques in\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-04.jpg?height=557&width=1305&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=388)\n\nFigure 2: An illustration of our semantic compression method. The input text is initially segmented into topic-based chunks, utilizing the graph representation. Subsequently, these chunks undergo refinement using pre-trained models to ensure the preservation of key information. Finally, the refined chunks are assembled in accordance with the original order. The resulting texts, which have been semantically compressed, are approximately 6-8 times shorter in length compared to the original input. Consequently, they fall within the context window of the LLMs. Furthermore, for additional extension of the length, other methods such as extrapolation and interpolation-based techniques can be concatenated. graphs. To identify this structure within long texts, we utilize weighted graphs to represent them and employ clustering methods to detect cliques in these graphs. The cliques can then be utilized to represent the topic-based content of the text, allowing us to obtain chunks based on the semantic relevance of the topics. We begin by sequentially constructing sentence-level blocks within given lengths and representing them as nodes in our graph. In this step, we parse the text into different sentences or sub-sentences based on punctuation marks. Next, we sequentially fill the sentence-level blocks until they exceed the desired length before proceeding to the next blocks. Once we have obtained the sentence-level blocks, we connect the graph representation of long text $\\mathcal{G}$ based on a pre-trained sentence embedding model (e.g., MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)), where the weight $\\mathcal{G}[i][j]$ represents the semantic similarity between the $i$-th and $j$-th sentence-level blocks.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

The Kanerva Machine: A Generative Distributed Memory\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yan Wu, Greg Wayne, Alex Graves, T. Lillicrap*\n\n**TL;DR:** An end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them that significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them. Inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory, it has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism. The memory is analytically tractable, which enables optimal on-line compression via a Bayesian update-rule. We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Compared with the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, our memory model has greater capacity and is significantly easier to train.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive KV cache compression is introduced, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) and demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Compression of Word Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yeachan Kim, Kang-Min Kim, SangKeun Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings and shows that the model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed representations of words have been an indispensable component for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the large memory footprint of word embeddings makes it challenging to deploy NLP models to memory-constrained devices (e.g., self-driving cars, mobile devices). In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively compress word embeddings. We fundamentally follow a code-book approach that represents words as discrete codes such as (8, 5, 2, 4). However, unlike prior works that assign the same length of codes to all words, we adaptively assign different lengths of codes to each word by learning downstream tasks. The proposed method works in two steps. First, each word directly learns to select its code length in an end-to-end manner by applying the Gumbel-softmax tricks. After selecting the code length, each word learns discrete codes through a neural network with a binary constraint. To showcase the general applicability of the proposed method, we evaluate the performance on four different downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly show that our method is effective and makes the highly compressed word embeddings without hurting the task accuracy. Moreover, we show that our model assigns word to each code-book by considering the significance of tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Online Learned Continual Compression with Adaptive Quantization Modules\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Lucas Caccia, Eugene Belilovsky, Massimo Caccia, Joelle Pineau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning and shows that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application of auto-encoders in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks. Furthermore we demonstrate this approach with larger images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Residual Dense Network for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Yu Kong, Yulun Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Bineng Zhong, Yun Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural network has recently achieved great success for image restoration (IR) and also offered hierarchical features. However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. ALTO: Adaptive Linearized Storage of Sparse Tensors\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The analysis of high-dimensional sparse data is becoming increasingly popular in many important domains. However, real-world sparse tensors are challenging to process due to their irregular shapes and data distributions. We propose the Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO) format, a novel mode-agnostic (general) representation that keeps neighboring nonzero elements in the multi-dimensional space close to each other in memory. To generate the indexing metadata, ALTO uses an adaptive bit encoding scheme that trades off index computations for lower memory usage and more effective use of memory bandwidth. Moreover, by decoupling its sparse representation from the irregular spatial distribution of nonzero elements, ALTO eliminates the workload imbalance and greatly reduces the synchronization overhead of tensor computations. As a result, the parallel performance of ALTO-based tensor operations becomes a function of their inherent data reuse. On a gamut of tensor datasets, ALTO outperforms an oracle that selects the best state-of-the-art format for each dataset, when used in key tensor decomposition operations. Specifically, ALTO achieves a geometric mean speedup of 8X over the best mode-agnostic (coordinate and hierarchical coordinate) formats, while delivering a geometric mean compression ratio of 4.3X relative to the best mode-specific (compressed sparse fiber) formats.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. H2OPUS-TLR: High Performance Tile Low Rank Symmetric Factorizations using Adaptive Randomized Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical memory*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Tile low rank representations of dense matrices partition them into blocks of roughly uniform size, where each off-diagonal tile is compressed and stored as its own low rank factorization. They offer an attractive representation for many data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where substantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved. TLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular perfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced trees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient performance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned to take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory hierarchy. There are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky and $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs. The difficulties in achieving high performance when factoring TLR matrices come from the expensive compression operations that must be performed during the factorization process and the adaptive rank distribution of the tiles that causes an irregular work pattern for the processing cores. In this work, we develop a dynamic batching operation and combine it with batched adaptive randomized approximations to achieve high performance both on GPUs and CPUs. Our implementation attains over 1.2 TFLOP/s in double precision on the V100 GPU, and is limited by the performance of batched GEMM operations. The Cholesky factorization of covariance matrix of size $N = 131K$ arising in spatial statistics can be factored to an accuracy $\\epsilon=10^{-2}$ in just a few seconds. We believe the proposed GEMM-centric algorithm allows it to be readily ported to newer hardware such as the tensor cores that are optimized for small GEMM operations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by combining hierarchical memory systems with adaptive compression, here are some key techniques and insights from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Systems\n\n### Hybrid State Space Models\n- The concept of hybrid state space models, as seen in B'MOJO, combines eidetic (long-term) and fading (short-term) memory. This approach can be integrated into language models to manage memory efficiently, allowing for seamless transitions between different types of memory[Analysis].\n\n### Multi-Scale Transformers\n- Multi-scale transformers can be used for efficient feature representation, enabling hierarchical processing. This architecture can handle different scales of information, optimizing memory usage by applying scale-specific compression ratios[Analysis].\n\n## Adaptive Compression\n\n### KV Cache Compression\n- The use of low-rank projection matrices for compressing the KV cache, as described in the MatryoshkaKV method, is highly relevant. This technique involves transforming cache features into lower-dimensional spaces using orthogonal projection matrices, which can be tuned with a distillation objective. This approach allows for adaptive compression rates across different layers and heads, maintaining a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate.\n\n### Prompt Compression\n- Techniques like AutoCompressor, 500xCompressor, and xRAG can be adapted for hierarchical memory systems. These methods compress prompts into shorter sequences of tokens, which can be integrated into the hierarchical processing framework.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Dai et al. (2019) present Transformer-XL which utilize segment-level recurrence agency and a novel positional encoding scheme. Beltagy et al. (2020) introduce Longformer with a sparse attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length. Bo (2021) provides a faster transformer, RWKV, which combines the strength of RNN and has linear complexity during inference. Dao et al. (2022) propose FlashAttention, a chunking strategy for the input, and utilize recomputation to avoid the quadratic complexity of attention computation. While these methods have the potential to handle longer input sequences (Ding et al., 2023), training new models can be costly. Moreover, these methods are not effective when dealing with out-of-distribution content lengths. The introduction of new positional embeddings requires fine-tuning on long sequences to adapt to the increased length, which can be computationally expensive. To address this, LongLoRA is introduced by Chen et al. (2023b), offering an efficient fine-tuning method with limited computational costs. More details on several other chunking strategies are provided in the survey by Huang et al. (2023). ### 2.3 PROMPTING\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to extend the context window through smart prompting designs. Wingate et al. (2022) utilize soft prompts to encode more information using fewer tokens. Chevalier et al. (2023) present AutoCompressor, which utilizes soft prompts to compress the input sequence and then extends the original length of the base model. Both Zhou et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2023) recurrently apply LLMs to summarize the input texts to maintain long short-term memory for specific purposes such as story writing and dialogue generation, respectively. ## 3 METHODOLOGY\n\nWe propose our semantic compression method for extending the context window. The core idea is to compress the input into shorter texts without losing the key information and important details. This enables us to effectively include more content within the fixed input length constraint of the LLM. Fig. 2 provides an overview of our method, which leverages pre-trained summarization models commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods also have limitations regarding the length of the input. Here, we propose a divide-and-conquer based approach that takes into account the structure of the text. By identifying the topic structure of lengthy texts and dividing them into blocks that exhibit a certain level of mutual independence, the content within each block can be compressed efficiently due to their statistical correlation. Each block is then processed in parallel using pre-trained models, and the results are combined to create a condensed textual input that can be processed by the LLM. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective way of summarizing long texts by leveraging both the structure and content of the original text. ### 3.1 MODEL\n\nReal-world textual content, such as speech and book, frequently displays hierarchical structures, wherein each section is structured around a particular topic, and different sections differ in topic in a sequential manner. This hierarchical structure, based on topics, bears resemblance to cliques in\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-04.jpg?height=557&width=1305&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=388)\n\nFigure 2: An illustration of our semantic compression method. The input text is initially segmented into topic-based chunks, utilizing the graph representation. Subsequently, these chunks undergo refinement using pre-trained models to ensure the preservation of key information. Finally, the refined chunks are assembled in accordance with the original order. The resulting texts, which have been semantically compressed, are approximately 6-8 times shorter in length compared to the original input. Consequently, they fall within the context window of the LLMs. Furthermore, for additional extension of the length, other methods such as extrapolation and interpolation-based techniques can be concatenated. graphs. To identify this structure within long texts, we utilize weighted graphs to represent them and employ clustering methods to detect cliques in these graphs. The cliques can then be utilized to represent the topic-based content of the text, allowing us to obtain chunks based on the semantic relevance of the topics. We begin by sequentially constructing sentence-level blocks within given lengths and representing them as nodes in our graph. In this step, we parse the text into different sentences or sub-sentences based on punctuation marks. Next, we sequentially fill the sentence-level blocks until they exceed the desired length before proceeding to the next blocks. Once we have obtained the sentence-level blocks, we connect the graph representation of long text $\\mathcal{G}$ based on a pre-trained sentence embedding model (e.g., MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)), where the weight $\\mathcal{G}[i][j]$ represents the semantic similarity between the $i$-th and $j$-th sentence-level blocks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nPingyi Zhou, Lu Hou, Bo Bai, Lei Deng, Wei Han<br>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. #### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) often impose limitations on the length of the text input to ensure the generation of fluent and relevant responses.

These LLMs have demonstrated the ability to engage in fluent and coherent conversations with human users, and have shown exceptional performance across various tasks, including document summarization, question-answering, dialogue bots, and code generation copilots. One critical issue faced by state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs is the restriction on the length of text that can be inputted into the model at once. When the input context exceeds the limit of the context window, the performance of these models rapidly declines. This limitation poses a challenge when it comes to handling long texts such as scientific papers, novels, and legal contracts with current LLMs. As a result, there has been a growing interest in finding ways to extend the input length without significantly compromising the model's performance. The limitation on the context window primarily stems from the quadratic computation of the selfattention mechanism in the transformer. Handling lengthy texts significantly increases the computational costs in terms of memory and time. Typically, models are trained on short contexts, and the maximum sequence length (i.e., the context window) is determined. If the models are compelled to generate contexts that exceed the context window, they tend to compromise the quality of the output due to the lack of position encoding information during the training process. Furthermore, generating long sequences imposes substantial memory requirements on the computational device. This accumulation of memory requirements and the lack of effective position encoding can result in length generalization failure (Anil et al., 2022), where the models struggle to generate meaningful and coherent text beyond a certain context window size. Some approaches have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges. One approach is to devise architectures with nearly linear complexity, which enables efficient scaling to handle\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-02.jpg?height=139&width=919&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=603)\n\nFigure 1: With the inclusion of the semantic compression module, the redundancies in the input are eliminated, thereby effectively extending the context window. The semantic compression is reminiscent of the concept of source coding in information theory. very long sequences. However, training a large model from scratch incurs substantial cost. Another strategy involves employing interpolation and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the position encoding to unseen sequence lengths. While this method has the potential to compromise the overall performance of LLMs, it still demands significant time and GPU resources for fine-tuning and inference on long sequences. Therefore, it is more efficient and resource-friendly to design methods that do not necessitate altering the parameters of the pre-trained model. While most previous algorithms relied on modifying the pre-trained model, we instead exploit the statistical properties of input natural language. One empirical phenomenon, known as Zipf's law (Zipf, 2016), observes that a small set of the most frequent word tokens in a large corpus of natural language account for almost all occurrences.\n```\n\n#### 4. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 227  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/32 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nexisting methods. The language model, pre-trained on texts of length $L$, predicts the $T$ th token $(T \\gg L)$. (a) Dense Attention has $O\\left(T^{2}\\right)$ time complexity and an increasing cache size. Its performance decreases when the text length exceeds the pre-training text length. (b) Window Attention caches the most recent $L$ tokens' KV. While efficient in inference, performance declines sharply once the starting tokens' keys and values are evicted. (c) Sliding Window with Re-computation rebuilds the KV states from the $L$ recent tokens for each new token. While it performs well on long texts, its $O\\left(T L^{2}\\right)$ complexity, stemming from quadratic attention in context re-computation, makes it considerably slow. (d) StreamingLLM keeps the attention sink (several initial tokens) for stable attention computation, combined with the recent tokens. It's efficient and offers stable performance on extended texts. Perplexities are measured using the Llama-2-13B model on the first book ( 65 K tokens) in the PG-19 test set. When applying LLMs for infinite input streams, two primary challenges arise:\n\n1. During the decoding stage, Transformer-based LLMs cache the Key and Value states (KV) of all previous tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a), which can lead to excessive memory usage and increasing decoding latency (Pope et al., 2022). 2. Existing models have limited length extrapolation abilities, i.e., their performance degrades (Press et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023) when the sequence length goes beyond the attention window size set during pre-training. An intuitive approach, known as window attention (Beltagy et al. 2020) (Figure 1 b), maintains only a fixed-size sliding window on the KV states of most recent tokens. Although it ensures constant memory usage and decoding speed after the cache is initially filled, the model collapses once the sequence length exceeds the cache size, i.e., even just evicting the $K V$ of the first token, as illustrated in Figure 3 Another strategy is the sliding window with re-computation (shown in Figure 11c), which rebuilds the KV states of recent tokens for each generated token. While it offers strong performance, this approach is significantly slower due to the computation of quadratic attention within its window, making this method impractical for real-world streaming applications. To understand the failure of window attention, we find an interesting phenomenon of autoregressive LLMs: a surprisingly large amount of attention score is allocated to the initial tokens, irrespective of their relevance to the language modeling task, as visualized in Figure 2. We term these tokens \"attention sinks\". Despite their lack of semantic significance, they collect significant attention scores. We attribute the reason to the Softmax operation, which requires attention scores to sum up to one for all contextual tokens. Thus, even when the current query does not have a strong match in many previous tokens, the model still needs to allocate these unneeded attention values somewhere so it sums up to one. The reason behind initial tokens as sink tokens is intuitive: initial tokens are visible to almost all subsequent tokens because of the autoregressive language modeling nature, making them more readily trained to serve as attention sinks. Based on the above insights, we propose StreamingLLM, a simple and efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite attention window to work on text of infinite length without finetuning. StreamingLLM exploits the fact that attention sinks have high attention values, and preserving them can maintain the attention score distribution close to normal. Therefore, StreamingLLM simply keeps the attention sink tokens' KV (with just 4 initial tokens sufficing) together with the sliding window's KV to anchor the attention computation and stabilize the model's performance. With StreamingLLM, models including Llama-2-[7, 13, 70]B, MPT-[7, 30]B, Falcon-[7, 40]B, and Pythia[2.9,6.9,12]B can reliably model 4 million tokens, and potentially even more. Compared with the only viable baseline, sliding window with recomputation, StreamingLLM achieves up to $22.2 \\times$ speedup, realizing the streaming use of LLMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_c4d42a88c0df416625cag-03.jpg?height=315&width=1335&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=384)\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of the average attention logits in Llama-2-7B over 256 sentences, each with a length of 16. Observations include: (1) The attention maps in the first two layers (layers 0 and 1 ) exhibit the \"local\" pattern, with recent tokens receiving more attention. (2) Beyond the bottom two layers, the model heavily attends to the initial token across all layers and heads. Furthermore, we confirm our attention sink hypothesis and demonstrate that language models can be pre-trained to require only a single attention sink token for streaming deployment. Specifically, we suggest that an extra learnable token at the beginning of all training samples can serve as a designated attention sink. By pre-training 160-million parameter language models from scratch, we demonstrate that adding this single sink token preserves the model's performance in streaming cases. This stands in contrast to vanilla models, which necessitate the reintroduction of multiple initial tokens as attention sinks to achieve the same performance level. Finally, we emphasize that StreamingLLM efficiently generates coherent text from tokens within the KV cache without extending the LLMs' context length. It suits continuous operation needs with minimal memory use and past data reliance. Additionally, StreamingLLM can complement context extension methods to increase the attendable recent context. ## 2 RELATEd WORK\n\nExtensive research has been done on applying LLMs to lengthy texts, with three main areas of focus: Length Extrapolation, Context Window Extension, and Improving LLMs' Utilization of Long Text. While seemingly related, it's worth noting that progress in one direction doesn't necessarily lead to progress in the other. For example, extending the context size of LLMs doesn't improve the model's performance beyond the context size, and neither approach ensures effective use of the long context. Our StreamingLLM framework primarily lies in the first category, where LLMs are applied to text significantly exceeding the pre-training window size, potentially even of infinite length. We do not expand the attention window size of LLMs or enhance the model's memory and usage on long texts. The last two categories are orthogonal to our focus and could be integrated with our techniques. Length extrapolation aims to enable language models trained on shorter texts to handle longer ones during testing. A predominant avenue of research targets the development of relative position encoding methods for Transformer models, enabling them to function beyond their training window. One such initiative is Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which transforms the queries and keys in every attention layer for relative position integration. Despite its promise, subsequent research (Press et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023) indicated its underperformance on text that exceeds the training window. Another approach, $\\overline{A L i B i}$ (Press et al., 2022), biases the query-key attention scores based on their distance, thereby introducing relative positional information. While this exhibited improved extrapolation, our tests on MPT models highlighted a breakdown when the text length was vastly greater than the training length. Current methodologies, however, have yet to achieve infinite length extrapolation, causing no existing LLMs to fit for streaming applications. Context Window Extension centers on expanding the LLMs' context window, enabling the processing of more tokens in one forward pass.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: semantic compression streaming attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Context Compression for Auto-regressive Transformers with Sentinel Tokens\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Siyu Ren, Qi Jia, Kenny Q. Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity. At last, we comprehensively profile the benefit of context compression on improving the system throughout.

Explainable Semantic Space by Grounding Language to Vision with Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Yizhen Zhang, Minkyu Choi, Kuan Han, Zhongming Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A visually grounded language model capable of embedding concepts in a visually grounded semantic space that enables compositional language understanding based on visual knowledge and multimodal image search with queries based on images, texts, or their combinations.\n\n**Abstract:** In natural language processing, most models try to learn semantic representations merely from texts. The learned representations encode the distributional semantics but fail to connect to any knowledge about the physical world. In contrast, humans learn language by grounding concepts in perception and action and the brain encodes grounded semantics for cognition. Inspired by this notion and recent work in vision-language learning, we design a two-stream model for grounding language learning in vision. The model includes a VGG-based visual stream and a Bert-based language stream. The two streams merge into a joint representational space. Through cross-modal contrastive learning, the model first learns to align visual and language representations with the MS COCO dataset. The model further learns to retrieve visual objects with language queries through a cross-modal attention module and to infer the visual relations between the retrieved objects through a bilinear operator with the Visual Genome dataset. After training, the language stream of this model is a stand-alone language model capable of embedding concepts in a visually grounded semantic space. This semantic space manifests principal dimensions explainable with human intuition and neurobiological knowledge. Word embeddings in this semantic space are predictive of human-defined norms of semantic features and are segregated into perceptually distinctive clusters. Furthermore, the visually grounded language model also enables compositional language understanding based on visual knowledge and multimodal image search with queries based on images, texts, or their combinations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. BERT-EMD: Many-to-Many Layer Mapping for BERT Compression with Earth Mover\u2019s Distance\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Jianquan Li, Xiaokang Liu, Honghong Zhao, Ruifeng Xu, Min Yang, Yaohong Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel BERT distillation method based on many-to-many layer mapping, which allows each intermediate student layer to learn from any intermediate teacher layers adaptively for various NLP tasks, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, high storage and computational costs obstruct pre-trained language models to be effectively deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a novel BERT distillation method based on many-to-many layer mapping, which allows each intermediate student layer to learn from any intermediate teacher layers. In this way, our model can learn from different teacher layers adaptively for various NLP tasks. %motivated by the intuition that different NLP tasks require different levels of linguistic knowledge contained in the intermediate layers of BERT. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to compute the minimum cumulative cost that must be paid to transform knowledge from teacher network to student network. EMD enables the effective matching for many-to-many layer mapping. %EMD can be applied to network layers with different sizes and effectively measures semantic distance between the teacher network and student network. Furthermore, we propose a cost attention mechanism to learn the layer weights used in EMD automatically, which is supposed to further improve the model's performance and accelerate convergence time. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared to strong competitors in terms of both accuracy and model compression.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. Bridging the Granularity Gap for Acoustic Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Chen Xu, Yuhao Zhang, Chengbo Jiao, Xiaoqian Liu, Chi Hu, Xin Zeng, Tong Xiao, Anxiang Ma, Huizhen Wang, Jingbo Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Progressive Down-Sampling (PDS) is proposed which gradually compresses the acoustic features into coarser-grained units containing more complete semantic information, like text-level representation, and a representation fusion method to alleviate information loss that occurs inevitably during high compression.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformer has become the de-facto standard for speech, modeling upon the fine-grained frame-level features remains an open challenge of capturing long-distance dependencies and distributing the attention weights. We propose \\textit{Progressive Down-Sampling} (PDS) which gradually compresses the acoustic features into coarser-grained units containing more complete semantic information, like text-level representation. In addition, we develop a representation fusion method to alleviate information loss that occurs inevitably during high compression. In this way, we compress the acoustic features into 1/32 of the initial length while achieving better or comparable performances on the speech recognition task. And as a bonus, it yields inference speedups ranging from 1.20$\\times$ to 1.47$\\times$. By reducing the modeling burden, we also achieve competitive results when training on the more challenging speech translation task.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning Rich Features for Image Manipulation Detection\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Peng Zhou, Xintong Han, Larry S. Davis, Vlad I. Morariu*\n\n**Abstract:** Image manipulation detection is different from traditional semantic object\ndetection because it pays more attention to tampering artifacts than to image\ncontent, which suggests that richer features need to be learned. We propose a\ntwo-stream Faster R-CNN network and train it endto- end to detect the tampered\nregions given a manipulated image. One of the two streams is an RGB stream\nwhose purpose is to extract features from the RGB image input to find tampering\nartifacts like strong contrast difference, unnatural tampered boundaries, and\nso on. The other is a noise stream that leverages the noise features extracted\nfrom a steganalysis rich model filter layer to discover the noise inconsistency\nbetween authentic and tampered regions. We then fuse features from the two\nstreams through a bilinear pooling layer to further incorporate spatial\nco-occurrence of these two modalities. Experiments on four standard image\nmanipulation datasets demonstrate that our two-stream framework outperforms\neach individual stream, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared\nto alternative methods with robustness to resizing and compression.\n\n**Conference:** learning-rich-features-for-image-manipulation-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. AlloST: Low-resource Speech Translation without Source Transcription\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Hsin-Min Wang, Hung-Shin Lee, Yao-Fei Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The end-to-end architecture has made promising progress in speech translation (ST). However, the ST task is still challenging under low-resource conditions. Most ST models have shown unsatisfactory results, especially in the absence of word information from the source speech utterance. In this study, we survey methods to improve ST performance without using source transcription, and propose a learning framework that utilizes a language-independent universal phone recognizer. The framework is based on an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model, where the encoder generates the phonetic embeddings and phone-aware acoustic representations, and the decoder controls the fusion of the two embedding streams to produce the target token sequence. In addition to investigating different fusion strategies, we explore the specific usage of byte pair encoding (BPE), which compresses a phone sequence into a syllable-like segmented sequence. Due to the conversion of symbols, a segmented sequence represents not only pronunciation but also language-dependent information lacking in phones. Experiments conducted on the Fisher Spanish-English and Taigi-Mandarin drama corpora show that our method outperforms the conformer-based baseline, and the performance is close to that of the existing best method using source transcription.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Coding Framework and Benchmark towards Low-Bitrate Video Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: semantic compression streaming attention*\n\n*Zhiyong Gao, Li Chen, Guangtao Zhai, Yichao Yan, Guo Lu, Yuan Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** Video compression is indispensable to most video analysis systems. Despite saving transportation bandwidth, it also deteriorates downstream video understanding tasks, especially at low-bitrate settings. To systematically investigate this problem, we first thoroughly review the previous methods, revealing that three principles, i.e., task-decoupled, label-free, and data-emerged semantic prior, are critical to a machine-friendly coding framework but are not fully satisfied so far. In this paper, we propose a traditional-neural mixed coding framework that simultaneously fulfills all these principles, by taking advantage of both traditional codecs and neural networks (NNs). On one hand, the traditional codecs can efficiently encode the pixel signal of videos but may distort the semantic information. On the other hand, highly non-linear NNs are proficient in condensing video semantics into a compact representation. The framework is optimized by ensuring that a transportation-efficient semantic representation of the video is preserved w.r.t. the coding procedure, which is spontaneously learned from unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner. The videos collaboratively decoded from two streams (codec and NN) are of rich semantics, as well as visually photo-realistic, empirically boosting several mainstream downstream video analysis task performances without any post-adaptation procedure. Furthermore, by introducing the attention mechanism and adaptive modeling scheme, the video semantic modeling ability of our approach is further enhanced. Finally, we build a low-bitrate video understanding benchmark with three downstream tasks on eight datasets, demonstrating the notable superiority of our approach.

This can be achieved by identifying the topic structure of lengthy texts and dividing them into blocks that exhibit a certain level of mutual independence. This approach is discussed in the context of extending the context window of large language models via semantic compression.\n\n## Streaming Attention Mechanisms\n- Streaming attention mechanisms can be optimized by selectively applying full attention to critical attention heads and using \"Streaming Attention\" on others. For example, the \"DuoAttention\" mechanism reduces both computational complexity and memory usage by applying full attention only where necessary and using streaming attention otherwise.\n\n## Combining Semantic Compression and Streaming Attention\n- To combine these techniques, one can implement hierarchical memory structures where semantic compression is used to reduce the memory footprint of long contexts. This compressed context can then be processed using streaming attention mechanisms.\n  - **Hierarchical Memory**: Organize memory into multiple levels with different compression ratios. Semantic compression can preserve important information while reducing the memory footprint. Adaptive compression can be applied based on attention patterns[Analysis Note].\n  - **Adaptive KV Cache Compression**: Techniques like those described in \"Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression\" can be used to evict long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, which aligns well with streaming attention[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient State Transitions\n- Efficient state transitions between memory levels are crucial for streaming performance. This can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that manage attention patterns effectively, such as using attention sinks to maintain performance in streaming scenarios[Analysis Note].\n\n## Specific Techniques\n- **SmoothAttention and QServe**: These techniques, developed by the MIT HAN Lab, involve progressive quantization and compute-aware weight reordering to reduce dequantization latency. While primarily focused on quantization, these methods can be adapted to optimize the interaction between compressed contexts and streaming attention, improving overall efficiency.\n- **Sparse Attention**: Utilizing sparse attention mechanisms, such as those mentioned in the context of SparseRefine, can enhance the efficiency of attention calculations. This can be particularly beneficial when combined with semantic compression to handle long contexts efficiently.\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Segment the input into blocks that can be compressed and then reassembled for processing by the streaming attention mechanism. This approach helps manage attention patterns and ensures efficient state transitions[Analysis Note].\n- **Lossless Compression**: Techniques like LoMA (Lossless Compressed Memory Attention) can be integrated to ensure that the compressed context does not lose important information during the compression process[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages semantic compression to reduce memory footprint, streaming attention to handle long contexts efficiently, and adaptive compression strategies to optimize performance based on attention patterns. This approach can significantly improve the model's scalability, efficiency, and overall performance.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.55)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/25 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.00752, 2023.

Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory optimization hardware*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

Deep Compression of Pre-trained Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory optimization hardware*\n\n*Naigang Wang, Chia-Chun Liu, Swagath Venkataramani, Sanchari Sen, Chia-Yu Chen, K. E. Maghraoui, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Le Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision are introduced and critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning are identified.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and have recently become competitive alternatives to Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in vision and speech tasks, respectively. Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory optimization hardware*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory optimization hardware*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. MCUFormer: Deploying Vision Tranformers on Microcontrollers with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory optimization hardware*\n\n*Yinan Liang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory called MCUFormer is proposed, where the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) is generalized to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the micro Controllers.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the high price and heavy energy consumption of GPUs, deploying deep models on IoT devices such as microcontrollers makes significant contributions for ecological AI. Conventional methods successfully enable convolutional neural network inference of high resolution images on microcontrollers, while the framework for vision transformers that achieve the state-of-the-art performance in many vision applications still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method called MCUFormer to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory, where we jointly design transformer architecture and construct the inference operator library to fit the memory resource constraint. More specifically, we generalize the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the microcontrollers, where we enlarge the existing search space of vision transformers by considering the low-rank decomposition dimensions and patch resolution for memory reduction. For the construction of the inference operator library of vision transformers, we schedule the memory buffer during inference through operator integration, patch embedding decomposition, and token overwriting, allowing the memory buffer to be fully utilized to adapt to the forward pass of the vision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCUFormer achieves 73.62\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for image classification with 320KB memory on STM32F746 microcontroller.

This approach significantly accelerates transformer self-attention operations by leveraging memristor crossbars for matrix multiplication and softmax calculations, demonstrating a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Multi-Scale Processing\n\n- Memory caching strategies are crucial for optimizing AI models. Techniques such as **eviction and regeneration**, **recomputation**, and **quantization** can reduce the memory footprint and improve performance. For instance, quantization reduces memory consumption by representing tensors with fewer bits, which is beneficial during both training and inference phases.\n\n- Efficient execution plans and dynamic memory allocation strategies, such as PagedAttention, can optimize memory usage by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks and minimizing peak memory usage. These strategies are essential for managing the memory requirements of hierarchical transformers.\n\n## Efficient Compression Strategies for Transformer States\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss compression strategies for transformer states, the concept of **pruning** can be applied. Pruning involves removing unnecessary connections within the neural network, which can result in a lighter model without significantly impacting performance. However, clever implementations of pruning, such as using sparsity-aware kernels, are necessary to achieve actual speed-ups.\n\n- The \"Analysis Note for HierStreamTTT Proposal\" mentions dynamic context pruning for efficient and interpretable autoregressive transformers, which can be seen as a form of compression by selectively retaining only the most relevant context information.\n\n## Integration of Streaming and Hierarchical Processing on Hardware\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer\" papers highlight the importance of tiling strategies and dynamic adaptation of context usage for managing different scales in streaming architectures. These approaches can be integrated into hierarchical processing frameworks to optimize both memory and latency.\n\n- The \"DuoAttention Framework\" distinguishes between \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads,\" reducing memory and latency without compromising long-context abilities. This framework can be optimized for hardware by careful coordination between scales and adaptive mechanisms for context selection.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Different Memory Management Strategies\n\n- The performance analysis of different memory management strategies is crucial. Techniques such as **kernel fusion**, which combines multiple operations into a single kernel execution, can improve computational efficiency and cache utilization. Additionally, **multi-threaded arena allocators** and **user-configurable allocation sizes** can manage memory efficiently in multi-tenant environments.\n\n- The \"Analysis Note for HierStreamTTT Proposal\" emphasizes the importance of efficient cache strategies for different processing scales and the need for careful coordination between scales to manage trade-offs between accuracy and latency.\n\nIn summary, the integration of memristor-based hardware accelerators, efficient memory caching and quantization strategies, dynamic context pruning, and optimized execution plans are key to improving the performance and efficiency of hierarchical autoregressive language models.\n",

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application.

Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: streaming attention sinks hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*Jang-Hyun Kim, Junyoung Yeom, Sangdoo Yun, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer language models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As the context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and computations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To address this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a lightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during inference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights. We achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as a single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation, personalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller context memory size. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the sliding window approach.

Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating streaming attention, hierarchical compression, and efficient memory management, here are some key findings and references that align with your investigation plan:\n\n## Streaming Attention Mechanisms and Attention Sinks\n\n- The concept of \"attention sinks\" has been explored in recent research. Attention sinks refer to the phenomenon where certain attention patterns in language models become non-informative and do not contribute to the value computation. A study on attention sinks suggests that replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, can prevent the emergence of attention sinks even in large models up to 1 billion parameters.\n\n- For streaming attention mechanisms, the paper \"Context window extension with multi-grained self-injection\" discusses efficient design principles for streaming language models. It introduces a hierarchical architecture (SharedLLM) that compresses past context information into multi-grained representations, which is crucial for streaming scenarios. This approach ensures efficient attention computation and memory usage by using a context tree structure and layer-wise connections between the lower and upper models.\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Techniques\n\n- The SharedLLM architecture proposed in the paper utilizes hierarchical compression by breaking down long input contexts into smaller chunks and compressing each chunk into compact and structured representations. This method involves a uniform downsampling of key-value states to retain only a portion of the information, creating a coarse-to-fine distribution of semantic information.\n\n- Another approach to hierarchical compression is discussed in the context of retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). The RECOMP method involves compressing retrieved documents into textual summaries using either extractive or abstractive compressors before prepending them to the model input. This helps in reducing memory usage and improving performance.\n\n## Efficient Memory Management in Streaming Scenarios\n\n- The SharedLLM architecture is designed to reduce memory usage significantly by compressing context information into structural representations. This approach allows for efficient memory management by minimizing the need to store large amounts of context data, making it suitable for streaming scenarios.\n\n- Other efficient memory management techniques include the use of linearized attention mechanisms that demand only O(L) space for attention computation, such as FlashAttention and PagedAttention. These methods maximize memory efficiency from a system perspective.\n\n## Integration of Multi-Scale Processing with Streaming Attention\n\n- The SharedLLM model integrates multi-scale processing by using a hierarchical architecture where the lower model compresses past context information into multi-grained representations, and the upper model integrates this compressed information to predict future tokens. This approach allows for scale-specific attention mechanisms and efficient multi-scale streaming operations.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Semantic Compression in Transformers\n\n- The performance analysis of semantic compression in transformers is crucial. The SharedLLM paper discusses how the hierarchical compression technique affects model performance. It highlights that the compression ratio and the structure of the context tree are key factors in balancing efficiency and performance. The method ensures that the compressed information retains the necessary semantic details, thus maintaining or even improving the model's performance.\n\n- Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed context compression techniques, while offering high parallelism and speed, need to balance memory consumption and performance. This trade-off is a critical aspect of the performance analysis, indicating that the right compression strategy can significantly impact the model's overall efficiency and accuracy.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can develop a more efficient and scalable autoregressive language model that integrates streaming attention, hierarchical compression, and optimized memory management.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/14 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nGeoffrey E.

GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture for Efficient Large-Scale Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Xin Yuan, Mingyu Zhu, Lishun Wang, Miao Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a low-speed 2D detector to capture high-speed scene, where the dynamic scene is modulated by different masks and then compressed into a snapshot measurement. Following this, a reconstruction algorithm is needed to reconstruct the high-speed video frames. Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms have achieved impressive results, they still face the following challenges due to excessive model complexity and GPU memory limitations: (1) These models need high computational cost, and (2) They are usually unable to reconstruct large-scale video frames at high compression ratios. To address these issues, we develop an efficient network for video SCI by using hierarchical residual-like connections and hybrid CNN-Transformer structure within a single residual block, dubbed EfficientSCI++. The EfficientSCI++ network can well explore spatial-temporal correlation using convolution in\r\nthe spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain, respectively. We are the first time to demonstrate that a UHD\r\ncolor video (1644\u00d73840 \u00d73) with high compression ratio (40) can be reconstructed from a snapshot 2D measurement using\r\na single end-to-end deep learning model with PSNR above 34 dB. Moreover, a mixed-precision model is trained to further\r\naccelerate the video SCI reconstruction process and save memory footprint. Extensive results on both simulation and real\r\ndata demonstrate that, compared with precious SOTA methods, our proposed EfficientSCI++ and EfficientSCI can achieve\r\ncomparable reconstruction quality with much cheaper computational cost and better real-time performance.

Peeling the Onion: Hierarchical Reduction of Data Redundancy for Efficient Vision Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Yanzhi Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Xiaohui Xie, Xiaolong Ma, Tianlong Chen, Minghai Qin, Hao Tang, Xuan Shen, Xin Meng, Peiyan Dong, Yanyue Xie, Mengshu Sun, Geng Yuan, Haoyu Ma, Zhenglun Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently obtained success in many applications, but their intensive computation and heavy memory usage at both training and inference time limit their generalization. Previous compression algorithms usually start from the pre-trained dense models and only focus on efficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In contrast, this paper points out that the million-scale training data is redundant, which is the fundamental reason for the tedious training. To address the issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an end-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed Tri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy reduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of training examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example, and number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can noticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining accuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup with 72.6% (+0.4) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-T, and 15.7% speedup with 79.9% (+0.1) Top-1 accuracy on Deit-S. This proves the existence of data redundancy in ViT.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Discrete Semantic Tokenization for Deep CTR Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer compression memory efficient*\n\n*Xiao-Ming Wu, Min-Yen Kan, Jieming Zhu, Jiahao Wu, Hengchang Hu, Qijiong Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating item content information into click-through rate (CTR) prediction models remains a challenge, especially with the time and space constraints of industrial scenarios. The content-encoding paradigm, which integrates user and item encoders directly into CTR models, prioritizes space over time. In contrast, the embedding-based paradigm transforms item and user semantics into latent embeddings, subsequently caching them to optimize processing time at the expense of space. In this paper, we introduce a new semantic-token paradigm and propose a discrete semantic tokenization approach, namely UIST, for user and item representation. UIST facilitates swift training and inference while maintaining a conservative memory footprint. Specifically, UIST quantizes dense embedding vectors into discrete tokens with shorter lengths and employs a hierarchical mixture inference module to weigh the contribution of each user--item token pair. Our experimental results on news recommendation showcase the effectiveness and efficiency (about 200-fold space compression) of UIST for CTR prediction.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical transformer compression, memory-efficient implementations, and hardware-aware designs, here are some key points and references that align with the specified details:\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Techniques in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The concept of hierarchical compression is closely related to the idea of continually compressing accumulating attention key/value pairs. For instance, the \"Compressed Context Memory\" approach by Kim et al. (2023) involves probabilistic compression methods, such as conditional LoRA, to reduce the context memory size while maintaining performance levels similar to full context models.\n\n- Another approach is the use of tiling techniques, as seen in \"Lightning Attention-2\" by Qin et al. (2024), which implements intra-block and inter-block components to achieve efficient attention mechanisms. This method can be adapted for hierarchical compression by dividing the attention space into multiple scales and applying compression techniques at each scale.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Multi-Scale Attention\n\n- Memory-efficient implementations can be achieved through techniques like attention sink mechanisms and compressed context memory. For example, \"StreamingLLM\" by Xiao et al. (2023) uses attention sink phenomena to recover performance with significantly reduced memory usage, enabling stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens.\n\n- The use of quantization and compression, as discussed in the context of memory caching strategies, can also reduce the memory footprint of AI models. By representing tensors with fewer bits, models can consume less memory, which is crucial for deployment on hardware-constrained devices.\n\n## Trade-Offs Between Compression Ratio and Model Performance\n\n- The trade-off between compression ratio and model performance is a critical aspect. Hierarchical compression techniques, such as those using probabilistic VQ or conditional LoRA, need to balance the compression ratio with the maintenance of model performance. For instance, Kim et al.'s work shows that a 5\u00d7 smaller context memory size can be achieved without significantly impacting performance.\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" paper also highlights that while achieving consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length, there are trade-offs in terms of model complexity and performance that need to be carefully managed.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Designs for Hierarchical Transformers\n\n- Hardware-aware designs are essential for efficient hierarchical transformers. The use of memristor-based in-memory computing, as described in the paper by Nature, can significantly accelerate transformer self-attention operations. This approach leverages memristor crossbars to perform matrix multiplications efficiently, reducing power consumption and latency.\n\n- The \"Lightning Attention-2\" implementation is also hardware-friendly, utilizing Triton for efficient execution, which is a critical consideration for scaling hierarchical transformer models.\n\n## Efficient State Management in Hierarchical Models\n\n- Efficient state management is crucial, especially in hierarchical models where multiple scales introduce new challenges. Techniques like dynamic memory allocation, such as PagedAttention, can optimize memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks, alleviating memory constraints during inference.\n\n- The use of recomputation instead of storing all intermediate results can also save memory at the cost of additional computation time. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where memory is a constraint.\n\nIn summary, the researchers can benefit from:\n- Hierarchical compression techniques like those in \"Compressed Context Memory\" and \"Lightning Attention-2\".\n- Memory-efficient implementations using attention sink mechanisms and compressed context memory.\n- Balancing compression ratios with model performance, as seen in the trade-offs discussed in the referenced papers.\n- Hardware-aware designs leveraging memristor-based in-memory computing and efficient execution frameworks like Triton.\n- Efficient state management techniques such as dynamic memory allocation and recomputation.\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.34)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

We investigate whether self-attention in large-scale pre-trained language models is as predictive of human eye fixation patterns during task-reading as classical cognitive models of human attention. We compare attention functions across two task-specific reading datasets for sentiment analysis and relation extraction. We find the predictiveness of large-scale pre-trained self-attention for human attention depends on \u2018what is in the tail\u2019, e.g., the syntactic nature of rare contexts.Further, we observe that task-specific fine-tuning does not increase the correlation with human task-specific reading.

ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: scale specific attention sinks streaming transformer*\n\n*Yufei Xu, Jing Zhang, Qiming Zhang, Dacheng Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The surprisingly good capabilities of plain vision transformers for pose estimation from various aspects are shown, namely simplicity in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training paradigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple baseline model called ViTPose.\n\n**Abstract:** Although no specific domain knowledge is considered in the design, plain vision transformers have shown excellent performance in visual recognition tasks. However, little effort has been made to reveal the potential of such simple structures for pose estimation tasks. In this paper, we show the surprisingly good capabilities of plain vision transformers for pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training paradigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple baseline model called ViTPose. Specifically, ViTPose employs plain and non-hierarchical vision transformers as backbones to extract features for a given person instance and a lightweight decoder for pose estimation. It can be scaled up from 100M to 1B parameters by taking the advantages of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of transformers, setting a new Pareto front between throughput and performance. Besides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input resolution, pre-training and finetuning strategy, as well as dealing with multiple pose tasks. We also empirically demonstrate that the knowledge of large ViTPose models can be easily transferred to small ones via a simple knowledge token. Experimental results show that our basic ViTPose model outperforms representative methods on the challenging MS COCO Keypoint Detection benchmark, while the largest model sets a new state-of-the-art.

Our approach leverages modern Transformer-based parsers, which inherently encode alignment information in their cross-attention weights, allowing us to extract this information during parsing. This eliminates the need for English-specific rules or the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that have been used in previous approaches. In addition, we propose a guided supervised method using alignment to further enhance the performance of our aligner. We achieve state-of-the-art results in the benchmarks for AMR alignment and demonstrate our aligner's ability to obtain them across multiple languages.

These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly attending to 50,000 pixels.

Causal architectures emit tokens at each frame, relying only on current and past signal, while non-causal models are exposed to a window of future frames at each step to increase predictive accuracy. This dichotomy amounts to a trade-off for real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system design: profit from the low-latency benefit of strictly-causal architectures while accepting predictive performance limitations, or realize the modeling benefits of future-context models accompanied by their higher latency penalty. In this work, we relax the constraints of this choice and present the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT). Our architecture is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with our novel regularization algorithms, delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their causal counterparts. We showcase our design experimentally by reporting comparative ASR task results with measures of accuracy and latency on both publicly accessible and production-scale, voice-assistant datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals and queries, here are some key findings and references that align with the specified keywords and details:\n\n## Scale-Specific Attention Mechanisms in Transformers\n\n- The concept of \"attention sinks\" is crucial here. Attention sinks refer to tokens that receive disproportionately high attention scores, often regardless of their semantic significance. A paper by Xiao et al. discusses the attention sink phenomenon and proposes a pre-scaling mechanism to encourage diverse attention scores on these tokens. This mechanism can improve the model's performance in continual learning and reduce over-smoothing.\n\n## Integration of Streaming and Hierarchical Processing\n\n- The \"DuoAttention\" framework is particularly relevant here. It distinguishes between \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads\" in attention mechanisms. Retrieval Heads require full attention across all tokens for processing long contexts, while Streaming Heads focus on recent tokens and attention sinks, using a lightweight, constant-length KV cache. This approach reduces memory and latency without compromising long-context abilities.\n\n## Memory Management in Multi-Scale Attention Systems\n\n- DuoAttention also addresses memory management by applying full KV cache only to Retrieval Heads and using a lightweight KV cache for Streaming Heads. This approach significantly reduces long-context inference memory and speeds up decoding and pre-filling, making it efficient for large language models like Llama-3-8B.\n\n## Efficient State Transitions in Hierarchical Models\n\n- The integration of hierarchical processing with streaming capabilities is highlighted in the DuoAttention framework. By identifying and optimizing the attention heads that require full attention versus those that can use a lightweight cache, it enables efficient state transitions and reduces computational overhead.\n\n## Dynamic Compression Techniques for Streaming Data\n\n- The work on DuoAttention includes optimization-based algorithms for identifying retrieval heads and streaming heads, which can be seen as a form of dynamic compression. This method ensures that only critical attention heads use full attention, while others use a more efficient, constant-length cache, thereby reducing memory and computational requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of \"StreamingLLM\" mentioned in another source, involves preserving attention sinks in the KV-cache to enable LLMs to generate infinite-length texts with a fixed memory budget. This approach is integrated into various systems to support efficient and endless LLM generation.\n\nThese findings and references provide insights into how to design and optimize autoregressive language models with scale-specific attention mechanisms, efficient memory management, and integration of streaming and hierarchical processing.\n",
