However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 4. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention.

This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.

For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency,\n  Performance, and Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: Gated linear attention*\n\n*Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance\nperformance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of\nthese models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to\ninvestigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models\nwith varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear\nAttention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and\nAdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Enhancing Transformer RNNs with Multiple Temporal Perspectives\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture*\n\n*Razvan-Gabriel Dumitru, Darius Peteleaza, Mihai Surdeanu*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the concept of multiple temporal perspectives, a novel approach\napplicable to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for enhancing their\nunderstanding of sequential data. This method involves maintaining diverse\ntemporal views of previously encountered text, significantly enriching the\nlanguage models' capacity to interpret context. To show the efficacy of this\napproach, we incorporate it into the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)\narchitecture, addressing its inherent challenge of retaining all historical\ninformation within a single hidden state. Notably, this improvement is achieved\nwith a minimal increase in the number of parameters --even as little as\n$0.04\\%$ of the original number of parameters. Further, the additional\nparameters necessary for the multiple temporal perspectives are fine-tuned with\nminimal computational overhead, avoiding the need for a full pre-training. The\nresulting model maintains linear computational complexity during prompt\ninference, ensuring consistent efficiency across various sequence lengths. The\nempirical results and ablation studies included in our research validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, showcasing improved performance across multiple\nbenchmarks.

RRWKV: Capturing Long-range Dependencies in RWKV\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture*\n\n*Leilei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Owing to the impressive dot-product attention, the Transformers have been the\ndominant architectures in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a\nnon-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product\nattention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling\nwith sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product\nattention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the\ntime-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of\nits limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full\ninformation obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer.\nTherefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value\n(RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV\nto effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational\nefficiency as well.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08T13:17:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-13T08:58:47Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical state space model*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical state space model*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Gated linear attention*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Vision-RWKV: Efficient and Scalable Visual Perception with RWKV-Like Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture*\n\n*Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Tong Lu, Lewei Lu, Xizhou Zhu, Zhe Chen, Weiyun Wang, Yuchen Duan*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but their high computational complexity limits their application in high-resolution image processing and long-context analysis. This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

Incorporating RWKV's stateful representations and efficient recursive updates can enhance the HierarchicalMamba model's ability to model long sequences efficiently. The preprint by Peng et al. (2023) is a crucial reference for understanding how to blend RNN and transformer capabilities.\n\n## Enhancing HierarchicalMamba with Linear Attention\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms:** Linear attention reduces the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, making it feasible to handle longer sequences. The work by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) on linear transformers provides a foundation for how linear attention can be implemented to improve scalability and efficiency.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in Hierarchical Models\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms:** Gates control the flow of information, allowing models to focus on relevant features and suppress irrelevant ones. The integration of gating mechanisms similar to those in GLA or RWKV within the hierarchical state space layers can improve the model's adaptability and performance. The study by Fu et al. (2023) on revisiting state space models for speech recognition highlights the benefits of incorporating gating mechanisms.\n\n## Preventing Information Leakage and Ensuring Causality\n\n- **Causal Convolutions:** Ensuring that any incorporated attention mechanisms maintain causality is crucial for the correctness of the language model. This involves using techniques such as causal convolutions to prevent future information from influencing past computations.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Empirical Results\n\n- **Existing Implementations:** Searching for existing implementations or repositories where linear attention has been integrated into hierarchical or state space models can provide practical insights. For example, the work by Gu et al. (2022) on Structured State Space sequence models (S4) demonstrates how state space models can be combined with deep learning to model long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n- **Benchmarks and Performance:** Analyzing benchmarks on language modeling tasks to gauge potential improvements in perplexity and downstream task performance is essential. This involves comparing the performance of models combining hierarchical state spaces and linear attention against baseline models.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **Yang, S., Wang, B., Shen, Y., Panda, R., & Kim, Y.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Gated State Space Models, Hierarchical Linear Attention, Selective State Spaces\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Spaces*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Spaces*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Spaces*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher design a novel language model (LM) block that integrates the strengths of hierarchical state space models (HSSMs), Gated Linear Attention (GLA), and other efficient sequence modeling techniques, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n## Integrating Gating Mechanisms into Hierarchical SSMs\n\n- The **Mamba architecture** introduced by Gu and Dao (2023) is crucial, as it integrates selective state spaces within a simplified neural network architecture. This allows for content-based reasoning and selective propagation or forgetting of information based on the current token.\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)** enhances the expressiveness of linear attention by incorporating data-dependent gates, maintaining linear complexity while improving performance. This mechanism can be integrated into HSSMs to control information flow and improve long-range dependency capture.\n\n## State Space Duality and Transformer Connections\n\n- The **State Space Duality (SSD) framework** developed by Dao and Gu (2024) provides a theoretical foundation for combining attention mechanisms with SSMs. This framework allows designing models that leverage the strengths of both paradigms, enabling efficient and expressive architectures.\n\n## Selective State Spaces in Mamba\n\n- The Mamba architecture's use of selective SSMs is key. By making SSM parameters functions of the input, Mamba can perform content-based reasoning, which is a significant improvement over traditional SSMs. This concept can be integrated into hierarchical models to enhance their ability to handle complex dependencies.\n\n## Hierarchical Modeling for Long-Range Dependencies\n\n- **Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS)**, as described by Bhirangi et al. (2024), stack structured state-space models to create a temporal hierarchy. This approach improves the ability to model complex temporal sequences by capturing both fast-changing and slow-changing patterns, which is beneficial for long-range dependency capture.\n\n## Efficient Implementations and Hardware Considerations\n\n- Efficient algorithms such as **Gated Linear Attention Transformers** and hardware-aware implementations are crucial for practical scalability. For example, **FLASHLinearAttention** and **CHELA** (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention) address stability issues and improve efficiency by leveraging computation tricks and hardware-aware parallel algorithms.\n\n## Applying RWKV Concepts\n\n- The **RWKV architecture** combines RNN efficiency with transformer-like capabilities. Integrating RWKV concepts into hierarchical SSMs can improve stateful representations and efficient recursive updates. The **RRWKV model** further enhances this by incorporating retrospecting abilities to capture long-range dependencies effectively.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **Gu, A., & Dao, T.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary.

We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

Gated-ViGAT: Efficient Bottom-Up Event Recognition and Explanation Using a New Frame Selection Policy and Gating Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Vasileios Mezaris, Dimitrios Daskalakis, Nikolaos Gkalelis*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, Gated-ViGAT, an efficient approach for video event recognition, utilizing bottom-up (object) information, a new frame sampling policy and a gating mechanism is proposed. Specifically, the frame sampling policy uses weighted in-degrees (WiDs), derived from the adjacency matrices of graph attention networks (GATs), and a dissimilarity measure to select the most salient and at the same time diverse frames representing the event in the video. Additionally, the proposed gating mechanism fetches the selected frames sequentially, and commits early-exiting when an adequately confident decision is achieved. In this way, only a few frames are processed by the computationally expensive branch of our network that is responsible for the bottom-up information extraction. The experimental evaluation on two large, publicly available video datasets (MiniKinetics, ActivityNet) demonstrates that Gated-ViGAT provides a large computational complexity reduction in comparison to our previous approach (ViGAT), while maintaining the excellent event recognition and explainability performance.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Selective Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Masked Language Modeling for Proteins via Linearly Scalable Long-Context Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Input-Dependent State Space Models*\n\n*Valerii Likhosherstov, Lucy Colwell, Xingyou Song, Krzysztof Choromanski, Andreea Gane, Adrian Weller, Jared Davis, David Dohan, David Belanger, Tamas Sarlos, Peter Hawkins*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a diverse range of domains. However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Input-Dependent State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Towards Hierarchical Importance Attribution: Explaining Compositional Semantics for Neural Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sequence Modeling*\n\n*xiangyang xue, Zhongyu Wei, Xiang Ren, Xisen Jin, Junyi Du*\n\n**Abstract:** The impressive performance of neural networks on natural language processing tasks attributes to their ability to model complicated word and phrase compositions. To explain how the model handles semantic compositions, we study hierarchical explanation of neural network predictions. We identify non-additivity and context independent importance attributions within hierarchies as two desirable properties for highlighting word and phrase compositions. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition, do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we start by proposing a formal and general way to quantify the importance of each word and phrase. Following the formulation, we propose Sampling and Contextual Decomposition (SCD) algorithm and Sampling and Occlusion (SOC) algorithm. Human and metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms outperform prior hierarchical explanation algorithms. Our algorithms help to visualize semantic composition captured by models, extract classification rules and improve human trust of models.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling.\nRecently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling.\nThese linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/HGRN.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher design a novel language model (LM) block that combines the strengths of hierarchical state space models (HSSMs), selective gating mechanisms, and input-dependent parameterization, here are the most relevant insights and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Selective Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **S7 Model**: The S7 model introduces input-dependent state space models where the transition matrices are functions of the input. This allows the model to adapt to the current input dynamically, enhancing its ability to capture long-range dependencies and filter out irrelevant information. The use of a gating mechanism (sigmoid activation) regulates the flow of information based on the input signal and current state.\n\n- **Gated State Spaces**: The concept of Gated State Spaces (GSS) involves using gating mechanisms to control the flow of information. This approach trains significantly faster than other models and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs.\n\n## Input-Dependent Parameterization\n\n- **Mamba Model**: Mamba integrates selective SSMs where the parameters are functions of the input, enabling content-based selection and forgetting. This model achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities by adapting its parameters based on the input.\n\n- **HGRN2**: This model expands the recurrent state size using an outer-product-based state expansion mechanism, which benefits from input-dependent dynamics. This allows for efficient and expressive sequence modeling without adding extra parameters.\n\n## Hierarchical Sequence Modeling\n\n- **Samba Model**: Samba combines Mamba with Sliding Window Attention (SWA), selectively compressing sequences into recurrent hidden states while maintaining precise memory recall via attention. This hybrid approach balances efficiency and expressiveness, particularly in handling long sequences.\n\n- **DenseMamba**: This model enhances the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers. This retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output and improves the model's ability to capture complex dependencies.\n\n## Combining Hierarchical Modeling with Selective Attention\n\n- **CHELA**: This approach replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a hierarchical manner. It benefits from both global abstraction and data-dependent selection, maintaining real linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Efficiency\n\n- **MambaByte**: This token-free adaptation of Mamba is trained autoregressively on byte sequences and is competitive with, or even outperforms, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks. It highlights the efficiency and practicality of Mamba-like models.\n\n- **Efficient Linear Attention**: Models like **HGRN2** and **GSS** demonstrate that linear attention forms and gating mechanisms can be designed to be hardware-efficient, which is crucial for practical deployment.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **S7 Model**:\n   - This model introduces input-dependent state space models, which adapt to the current input dynamically, enhancing the capture of long-range dependencies and filtering out irrelevant information.\n\n2. **Mamba Model**:\n   - Integrates selective SSMs where parameters are functions of the input, enabling content-based selection and forgetting.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants. This framework yields insights on how recent SSMs (e.g. Mamba) perform as well as Transformers on language modeling. Moreover, our theoretical tools provide new ideas to improve SSMs (and potentially Transformers) by connecting the algorithmic and systems advances on both sides. As a demonstration, the framework guides our design of a new architecture (Mamba-2) at the intersection of SSMs and structured attention. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Angela Wu for the suggestion on how to efficiently compute the gradient of $\\Delta$ in a numerically stable manner.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/24 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2209.10655, 2022. [36] Eric Martin and Chris Cundy.

MambaForGCN: Enhancing Long-Range Dependency with State Space Model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*A. Lawan, Juhua Pu, Haruna Yunusa, Aliyu Umar, Muhammad Lawan*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents MambaForGCN, a novel approach to enhance short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA, which incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment Analysis (ABSA) identifies and evaluates sentiments toward specific aspects of entities within text, providing detailed insights beyond overall sentiment. However, Attention mechanisms and neural network models struggle with syntactic constraints, and the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms hinders their adoption for capturing long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead to the misinterpretation of irrelevant con-textual words, restricting their effectiveness to short-range dependencies. Some studies have investigated merging semantic and syntactic approaches but face challenges in effectively integrating these methods. To address the above problems, we present MambaForGCN, a novel approach to enhance short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This innovative approach incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information. The Multihead Attention (MHA) and Mamba blocks in the MambaFormer module serve as channels to enhance the model with short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words. We also introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) gated fusion, an adaptively integrated feature representation system combining SynGCN and MambaFormer representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate MambaForGCN's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/29 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n274, Aug. 2023, doi: 10.1016/j.knosys. 2023.110648\n[19] A.

This is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to selectively propagate or suppress information based on the content, which can improve training efficiency and generalization to longer sequences.\n\n### Input-Dependent Parameterization\n- Making model parameters functions of the input, as in the **Mamba** architecture, enables dynamic adaptation to varying contexts. This approach enhances content-based reasoning and improves the model's expressiveness. **DenseMamba** further refines this by integrating shallow-layer states into deeper layers, improving information flow and retaining fine-grained details.\n\n### Hierarchical Sequence Modeling\n- Hierarchical structures, such as those in **HierarchicalMamba** and **HGRN**, allow the model to capture dependencies at multiple temporal scales. This balances the modeling of short-term and long-term dependencies effectively.\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n- Integrating **GLA** into hierarchical SSMs can maintain linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness. GLA introduces data-dependent gates that modulate attention weights, improving the model's ability to focus on relevant information dynamically.\n\n### RWKV Architecture\n- Incorporating ideas from the **RWKV** architecture can improve stateful representations and efficient recursive updates. RWKV blends RNN efficiency with Transformer capabilities, achieving linear inference complexity, which is beneficial for long-range dependency capture without increasing computational overhead.\n\n## Relevant Models and Architectures\n\n### Mamba and Its Variants\n- The **Mamba** architecture, inspired by classical state space models, offers near-linear scalability with respect to sequence length and retains modeling capabilities comparable to Transformers. Variants like **DenseMamba** and **HierarchicalMamba** further enhance information flow and hierarchical modeling capabilities.\n\n### State Space Models (SSMs)\n- **SSMs**, particularly those with selective state spaces, have shown superiority over Transformers in sequence processing tasks due to their linear scalability. The **Mamba2** architecture, with its state space duality, simplifies matrix transformations and enhances adaptability.\n\n### Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM)\n- The **HDM** model, which replaces Transformer architectures with Mamba layers, demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical modeling in capturing both local and global dependencies. This model uses a high-level mechanism and a low-level controller to predict sub-goals and actions, respectively.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- Efficient algorithms and hardware-aware implementations are crucial. Models like **GSS**, **HGRN2**, and **Mamba** demonstrate that gating mechanisms and input-dependent parameterization can be designed to be hardware-efficient, ensuring scalability to longer sequences and suitability for real-world applications.\n\n### Training Stability\n- Addressing training stability issues that may arise from input-dependent parameters and gating mechanisms is essential. Ensuring that the integration of multiple concepts does not introduce significant computational overhead is also critical.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### Finalize Model Design\n- Develop a detailed design of the LM block that integrates hierarchical state space modeling with selective gating and input-dependent parameterization. Incorporate Gated Linear Attention mechanisms to enhance expressiveness while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### Practical Implementations\n- Plan for efficient computation by considering hardware constraints and parallelization opportunities. Optimize the model for linear computational complexity to handle long sequences effectively.\n\n### Proposal Drafting\n- Organize the insights and design decisions into a coherent proposal. Clearly articulate the motivation, theoretical justifications, and expected benefits of the proposed model.\n\nBy combining these concepts, the researcher can design a novel LM block that leverages the strengths of hierarchical state space models, selective gating mechanisms, input-dependent parameterization, and efficient attention mechanisms, ultimately leading to a more efficient, expressive, and scalable language model.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Itamar Zimerman, Ameen Ali, Lior Wolf*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A unified view of attention-free layers of Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs is presented, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers and providing a direct means for applying explainability methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient sequence modeling have led to attention-free layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, all featuring sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length and excellent scaling properties, enabling the construction of a new type of foundation models. In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/24 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n6 0}$ | $\\mathbf{8 6 . 4 0}$ | $\\mathbf{6 2 . 5 1}$ |\n\nPerturbation Tests To assess the faithfulness of explanations, we adopted an input perturbation scheme similar to [11, 10]. This method involves systematically masking image pixels based on their predicted relevance from the explanation method. We conducted two experiments: positive and negative perturbation. (1) Positive Perturbation: in this setup, a good explanation prioritizes relevant pixels. We expect the model's accuracy (specifically, top-1 accuracy) to gradually decrease as we mask pixels in descending order of relevance (most relevant first). (2) Negative Perturbation: Conversely, a robust explanation should maintain model accuracy even when irrelevant pixels are masked. Here, we mask pixels in ascending order of relevance (least relevant first). In both scenarios, we evaluate the explanation quality using the Area-Under-Curve (AUC) metric. AUC considers the model's accuracy as a function of the percentage of masked pixels (ranging from $10 \\%$ to $90 \\%$ ). The perturbations results are summarized in Table 2 for various explanation methods under both positive and negative perturbation scenarios on the ImageNet validation set. In the positive perturbation scenario, where lower AUC values indicate better performance, our proposed Mamba's attention method consistently outperforms the other methods. Specifically, our method achieves the lowest AUC values across all explanation methods, with an AUC of 13.264 for Raw-Attention, 12.830 for Attn-Rollout, and a notably low 11.350 for Attribution. In the negative perturbation scenario, where higher AUC values are better, our method shows the best performance, with AUC values of 47.705 for Raw-Attention, 50.035 for Attn-Rollout, and 51.310 for Attribution, outperforming both the method of [2] and the counterpart XAI methods for Vision Transformer. Perturbation experiments for the NLP domain can be found in Appendix C. In these settings, we fine-tune various LLMs with an additional linear layer classifier and append the [CLS] token to all samples to generate explanation maps, similar to methods used in vision models. These results also demonstrate that our attention formulation surpasses the previous formulation proposed by [2] over the mamba model and is effective also for the RWKV model. Ablation study The architectures we explored implicitly parametrize attention matrices through a composition of several different sub-layers, see Eq 9 , and 15 . Examples of these sub-layers include linear recurrent layers, gate mechanisms, and other components, such as token-shift or depth-wise convolutions.

Initially, in Fig 5. we visualize the implicit attention of Mamba, ablating the Conv1D or the gate branch, or focusing solely on the S6 layer. As expected, it seems that the Conv1D layer causes a smoothing effect, and the final Mamba implicit attention is significantly sharper than that of the S6 matrices. In Tab3, we compare several ablation variants of our method. As can be seen, our method, which utilizes all the components of Mamba, achieves a much better score than the ablated versions, illustrating the importance of all components. This experiment reveals that including the Conv1D layer is crucial for high performance. However, the activation has a relatively low impact on the implicit representation. A similar ablation study was conducted for RWKV and presented in Appendix C. It is evident that including the gate branch, as presented in our method, consistently improves performance.

Our unified framework facilitates the exploration of similarities and differences among non-attention layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and Griffin, and their interconnections with transformer architectures. Additionally, it enables the development of innovative explainability techniques for the latest attention-free architectures. Our contributions provide the research community with new tools for analyzing the performance, fairness, and robustness of gated-linear RNN variants, while also identifying their potential vulnerabilities. These advancements set the stage for future improvements and support the implementation of weakly supervised downstream tasks. Looking ahead, we aim to incorporate additional layers, such as Hyena [44], and HGRN2 [46] into our framework, including their vision-specific variants [16, 18, 66, 51]. Furthermore, we plan to examine how differences in these architectures are reflected in their self-attention matrices and explore whether such insights can reveal more about the inductive biases inherent in each architecture. ## 6 Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Tel Aviv University Center for AI and Data Science (TAD).

Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/56 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nThis suggests that the training sequence length should be carefully chosen according to the intended downstream use of the model. ### 6.2. Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

The concept of GLA can be drawn from Transformer architectures, where attention mechanisms are crucial for capturing long-range dependencies. The researcher can explore how to adapt GLA to work within the hierarchical SSM framework**Analysis Note**.\n\n## Computational Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The Mamba model, built upon State Space Models (SSMs), offers linear complexity and constant memory, which is crucial for processing long sequences efficiently. This aspect is aligned with the goal of maintaining computational efficiency in the GatedHierarchicalMamba model.\n- The introduction of a global selection mechanism in Mamba, which adds only 4M additional parameters to a 130M-sized model, shows that significant improvements can be achieved with minimal additional complexity. This could serve as a guideline for balancing model complexity and performance in GatedHierarchicalMamba.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Challenges\n\n- The **EMMA** model, which empowers multi-modal Mamba with structural and hierarchical alignment, demonstrates how to integrate additional mechanisms (like pixel-wise alignment and multi-scale feature fusion) into Mamba-based architectures. This could provide insights into how to integrate GLA and selective gating mechanisms effectively.\n- The **ESM-Click** method, which uses a Mamba-based backbone network for interactive medical image segmentation, highlights the importance of spatial feature enhancement and multi-scale feature fusion. These techniques could be adapted to enhance the feature processing in GatedHierarchicalMamba.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Global Selection Mechanism**: Incorporating a global selection mechanism, as seen in the Mamba model, can significantly improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and avoid over-reliance on local patterns.\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Hierarchical structures, such as those in **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network**, can effectively model both short-term and long-term dependencies, which is crucial for the proposed GatedHierarchicalMamba model**Analysis Note**.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Maintaining linear complexity and constant memory, as achieved by the Mamba model, is essential for efficient processing of long sequences.\n- **Practical Considerations**: The integration of additional mechanisms, such as GLA and selective gating, should be balanced with model complexity and training stability, using techniques like proper initialization, regularization, and optimization strategies**Analysis Note**.\n\nBy leveraging these insights, the researcher can design a robust and efficient GatedHierarchicalMamba model that enhances expressiveness, captures complex temporal patterns, and maintains computational efficiency.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/28 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nwhere decoding every token requires attending to the whole past. The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 3.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch.

Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 4. Masked Language Modeling for Proteins via Linearly Scalable Long-Context Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Input-Dependent State Space Models*\n\n*Valerii Likhosherstov, Lucy Colwell, Xingyou Song, Krzysztof Choromanski, Andreea Gane, Adrian Weller, Jared Davis, David Dohan, David Belanger, Tamas Sarlos, Peter Hawkins*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a diverse range of domains. However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Input-Dependent State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher evaluate and refine the \"GatedHierarchicalMamba\" proposal, here are the key insights and relevant information gathered from the provided sources:\n\n## Novelty Assessment\n\n- The integration of gating mechanisms and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) into hierarchical state space models (SSMs) appears to be a novel approach. While Mamba models have been explored in various contexts, such as medical image segmentation and multi-modal tasks, the specific combination of GLA with hierarchical SSMs is not explicitly mentioned in the sources provided.\n\n## Feasibility and Theoretical Justification\n\n- Mamba models, based on state-space models (SSMs), have been shown to be theoretically sound and efficient in modeling long-range dependencies. They are formulated as either a recurrence or convolution with near-linear scaling in sequence length, which aligns well with the goal of maintaining computational efficiency.\n- The use of gating mechanisms and GLA would need to be mathematically justified to ensure stability and correctness. For instance, the Mamba architecture's ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently suggests that integrating input-dependent gating mechanisms could enhance this capability, but it requires careful formulation to avoid issues like vanishing gradients.\n\n## Impact on Performance\n\n- The Mamba architecture has demonstrated competitive performance in various sequential tasks, including NLP, speech, and motion, while being more computationally efficient than transformer-based models. Integrating GLA and gating mechanisms could further enhance the model's expressiveness and ability to capture complex temporal patterns.\n- The hierarchical gated convolutional network (HGCN) in MambaClinix, which mimics the attention mechanism of Transformers using a purely convolutional structure, shows that such designs can effectively capture high-order spatial interactions without the computational complexity of Transformers. This suggests that a similar approach in language modeling could be beneficial.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Work\n\n- The EMMA model, which empowers multi-modal Mamba with structural and hierarchical alignment, includes a pixel-wise alignment module and a multi-scale feature fusion module. While this is in the context of multi-modal tasks, it indicates that hierarchical and structural alignments can be effectively integrated into Mamba models, which could be a precedent for the proposed language modeling approach.\n- The MedSegMamba and MambaClinix architectures, which combine Mamba with other techniques like CNNs and HGCN, demonstrate that hybrid approaches can enhance performance in specific tasks. This suggests that integrating GLA and gating mechanisms into HierarchicalMamba could offer similar benefits in language modeling.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms and GLA:**\n  - The use of gating mechanisms, such as those in LSTM and GRU models, has been effective in capturing long-range dependencies. However, these models have limitations, such as vanishing gradients. The Mamba architecture, with its state-space model formulation, offers a more efficient and stable alternative. Integrating GLA could enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant content, similar to how attention mechanisms work in Transformers.\n\n- **Hierarchical State Space Models:**\n  - Mamba models have been shown to excel in capturing long-range dependencies efficiently. The hierarchical structure proposed in \"GatedHierarchicalMamba\" could leverage this efficiency while adding the benefits of content-based reasoning through GLA and gating mechanisms.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:**\n  - The Mamba architecture is designed to maintain linear computational complexity, which is crucial for large-scale language models. The integration of GLA and gating mechanisms would need to be carefully designed to ensure this efficiency is preserved.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **External Searches:**\n  - Search for recent papers on the integration of GLA and gating mechanisms into SSMs or similar architectures.\n  - Look for studies on input-dependent or adaptive parameterization in state space models, particularly in the context of language modeling.\n\n- **Internal Library Search:**\n  - Search the internal repository for any papers or articles that discuss the integration of gating mechanisms or GLA into hierarchical SSMs.\n\n- **Review Prior Designs:**\n  - Compare the proposal with previous design proposals like \"adaptivemamba2,\" \"hybridrwkv,\" and \"cmattt\" to assess similarities and differences.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can comprehensively evaluate the \"GatedHierarchicalMamba\" proposal and ensure it offers novel and theoretically sound contributions to the field of language modeling.\n",

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants. This framework yields insights on how recent SSMs (e.g. Mamba) perform as well as Transformers on language modeling. Moreover, our theoretical tools provide new ideas to improve SSMs (and potentially Transformers) by connecting the algorithmic and systems advances on both sides. As a demonstration, the framework guides our design of a new architecture (Mamba-2) at the intersection of SSMs and structured attention. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Angela Wu for the suggestion on how to efficiently compute the gradient of $\\Delta$ in a numerically stable manner.

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 9 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Hierarchical State Space Models\" \"Language Modeling\", \"Integrating Gated Attention into State Space Models\", \"Content-Based Gating Mechanisms in Hierarchical Models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Hierarchical State Space Models\" \"Language Modeling\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"Hierarchical State Space Models\" \"Language Modeling\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrating Gated Attention into State Space Models\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, most of the multimodal methods\nuse attention mechanisms to extract visual clues regardless of whether the text\nand image are relevant. Practically, the irrelevant text-image pairs account\nfor a large proportion in tweets. The visual clues that are unrelated to the\ntexts will exert uncertain or even negative effects on multimodal model\nlearning. In this paper, we introduce a method of text-image relation\npropagation into the multimodal BERT model.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Content-Based Gating Mechanisms in Hierarchical Models\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling.

In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrating Gated Attention into State Space Models\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrating Gated Attention into State Space Models\"*\n\n*Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Michael Kopp, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Andreas Auer, Markus Spanring, Korbinian P\u00f6ppel, Maximilian Beck*\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Content-Based Gating Mechanisms in Hierarchical Models\"*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 12 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 7 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models\", \"Hierarchical Gated State Space Models\", \"Hybrid Models combining SSMs and Gated Attention\", \"Dynamic Parameterization in Hierarchical SSMs\", \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models\", \"Hierarchical Gated State Space Models\", \"Hybrid Models combining SSMs and Gated Attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Hierarchical Character Tagger for Short Text Spelling Error Correction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Gated State Space Models\"*\n\n*Mengyi Gao, Canran Xu, Peng Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art approaches to spelling error correction problem include\nTransformer-based Seq2Seq models, which require large training sets and suffer\nfrom slow inference time; and sequence labeling models based on Transformer\nencoders like BERT, which involve token-level label space and therefore a large\npre-defined vocabulary dictionary. In this paper we present a Hierarchical\nCharacter Tagger model, or HCTagger, for short text spelling error correction.\nWe use a pre-trained language model at the character level as a text encoder,\nand then predict character-level edits to transform the original text into its\nerror-free form with a much smaller label space. For decoding, we propose a\nhierarchical multi-task approach to alleviate the issue of long-tail label\ndistribution without introducing extra model parameters. Experiments on two\npublic misspelling correction datasets demonstrate that HCTagger is an accurate\nand much faster approach than many existing models.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-29T08:04:34Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-29T08:04:34Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

While SNNs are increasing\ncompetitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are\nrarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics.\nIn this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long\nsequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state\nspace models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically\nintegrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing\nsparse synaptic computation.

The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language\n  Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Parameterization in Hierarchical SSMs\"*\n\n*Yash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, Michael Hahn*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have\nshown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with\ntransformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle\nabilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for\nbetter LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the\ncapacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional\nRNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct\nstrengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and\nexact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly.\nThey can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even\nwithout simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in\ncurrent SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for\nSSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-27T17:46:57Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-02T19:43:55Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MambaClinix: Hierarchical Gated Convolution and Mamba-Based U-Net for Enhanced 3D Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models\"*\n\n*Qian Dong, Bin Wei, Fengjiao Wang, Feifei Wang, Xia Yang, Nan Xia, Chenyuan Bian*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, has significantly advanced 3D medical image segmentation. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing local features, their limited receptive fields may hinder performance in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive, making them expensive to train and deploy. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on the State Space Model (SSM), has been proposed to efficiently model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. However, its application in medical image segmentation reveals shortcomings, particularly in capturing critical local features essential for accurate delineation of clinical regions. In this study, we propose MambaClinix, a novel U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation that integrates a hierarchical gated convolutional network(HGCN) with Mamba in an adaptive stage-wise framework. This design significantly enhances computational efficiency and high-order spatial interactions, enabling the model to effectively capture both proximal and distal relationships in medical images. Specifically, our HGCN is designed to mimic the attention mechanism of Transformers by a purely convolutional structure, facilitating high-order spatial interactions in feature maps while avoiding the computational complexity typically associated with Transformer-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific Tversky loss, which emphasizes specific pixel regions to improve auto-segmentation performance, thereby optimizing the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MambaClinix achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba-Spike: Enhancing the Mamba Architecture with a Spiking Front-End for Efficient Temporal Data Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models\"*\n\n*Feng Liu, Jiahao Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological neural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates a spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust temporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven nature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous, time-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's selective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model complex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike employs biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and synaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other hand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process relevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets, including DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

HAKG: Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Gated Network for Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Gated State Space Models\"*\n\n*Yunjun Gao, Baihua Zheng, Lu Chen, Xinjun Zhu, Yuntao Du*\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge graph (KG) plays an increasingly important role to improve the recommendation performance and interpretability. A recent technical trend is to design end-to-end models based on information propagation schemes. However, existing propagation-based methods fail to (1) model the underlying hierarchical structures and relations, and (2) capture the high-order collaborative signals of items for learning high-quality user and item representations. In this paper, we propose a new model, called Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Gated Network (HAKG), to tackle the aforementioned problems. Technically, we model users and items (that are captured by a user-item graph), as well as entities and relations (that are captured in a KG) in hyperbolic space, and design a hyperbolic aggregation scheme to gather relational contexts over KG. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel angle constraint to preserve characteristics of items in the embedding space. Furthermore, we propose a dual item embeddings design to represent and propagate collaborative signals and knowledge associations separately, and leverage the gated aggregation to distill discriminative information for better capturing user behavior patterns. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that, HAKG achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods like CKAN, Hyper-Know, and KGIN. Further analyses on the learned hyperbolic embeddings confirm that HAKG offers meaningful insights into the hierarchies of data.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Discrete-time Temporal Network Embedding via Implicit Hierarchical Learning in Hyperbolic Space\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Gated State Space Models\"*\n\n*Irwin King, Zengfeng Huang, Marcus Kalander, Min Zhou, Menglin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Representation learning over temporal networks has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially, HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves AUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and HTC modules.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid Models combining SSMs and Gated Attention\"*\n\n*Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Kangwook Lee, Samet Oymak, Jaewoong Cho, Nayoung Lee, Zheyang Xiong, Jaeseung Park, Jongho Park*\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, specifically the \"GatedHierarchicalMamba\" architecture, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Novelty and Unique Contribution\nThe proposal to integrate Gated Linear Attention (GLA) into Hierarchical State Space Models (SSMs) appears to be novel.

However, pure SSMs may struggle with content-based reasoning and capturing complex temporal patterns inherent in natural language.\n\nOn the other hand, **FastTTTLinear** integrates Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and concepts from the RWKV architecture to enhance expressiveness and computational efficiency, particularly for long sequences. GLA introduces data-dependent gating mechanisms that modulate attention weights based on input content, improving the model's ability to focus on relevant information.\n\nThe motivation behind **GatedHierarchicalMamba** is to combine the strengths of both HierarchicalMamba and FastTTTLinear. By integrating selective gating mechanisms and Gated Linear Attention into the hierarchical state space framework, we aim to enhance the model's expressiveness, enable content-based reasoning, and maintain computational efficiency. This integration is expected to improve perplexity on corpora, enhance downstream task performance, and offer better scalability with larger models and datasets.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n\n- **HierarchicalMamba** extends the Mamba2Layer by introducing hierarchical processing, capturing both local and global dependencies in sequences.\n- **HiSS (Bhirangi et al., 2024)** demonstrates that stacking SSMs to create a temporal hierarchy improves the ability to model complex temporal sequences by capturing both fast-changing and slow-changing patterns.\n\n### Gated Linear Attention\n\n- **GLA (Yang et al., 2023)** introduces data-dependent gating mechanisms to enhance the expressiveness of linear attention while maintaining linear complexity.\n- GLA models generalize effectively to sequences longer than those encountered during training and offer hardware-efficient training capabilities.\n\n### Selective Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **GSS (Mehta et al., 2022)** utilizes gating mechanisms in state space models to regulate information flow, improving training efficiency and generalization to longer inputs.\n- **Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023)** integrates selective SSMs into a simplified neural network architecture, enabling content-based reasoning through input-dependent parameterization.\n\n### RWKV Architecture\n\n- **RWKV (Peng et al., 2023)** combines RNN efficiency with Transformer capabilities, achieving linear computational complexity during inference.\n- RWKV's approach to maintaining stateful representations and efficient recursive updates can be beneficial when integrated into hierarchical SSMs.\n\nThese studies collectively highlight the potential benefits of integrating gating mechanisms, input-dependent parameterization, and efficient attention mechanisms into hierarchical state space models.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Advantages and Disadvantages of Parent Units\n\n#### HierarchicalMamba\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Captures dependencies at multiple temporal scales.\n- Efficient processing with linear computational complexity.\n- Enhances long-range dependency modeling.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Lacks content-based reasoning due to fixed SSM parameters.\n- May struggle with complex temporal patterns inherent in language.\n\n#### FastTTTLinear\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Integrates Gated Linear Attention to enhance expressiveness.\n- Maintains linear time and space complexity.\n- Improves scalability for long sequences.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Does not leverage hierarchical state space modeling.\n- May not capture multi-scale temporal dependencies as effectively.\n\n### Key Concept and Philosophy\n\nThe key philosophy behind **GatedHierarchicalMamba** is to enhance a hierarchical state space model with selective gating mechanisms and GLA to combine the strengths of both architectures. By introducing input-dependent parameterization and gating mechanisms into HierarchicalMamba, the model gains the ability to perform content-based reasoning and dynamically control information flow. Integrating GLA further enhances expressiveness by allowing the model to focus on relevant information dynamically without increasing computational complexity.\n\n### Mathematical and Logical Arguments\n\n1. **Input-Dependent Parameterization:**\n\n   - Traditional SSMs use fixed parameters \\( \\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C} \\).\n   - We make SSM parameters functions of the input \\( X \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{A}(X), \\quad \\mathbf{B}(X), \\quad \\mathbf{C}(X)\n     \\]\n\n   - This allows the model to adaptively adjust its dynamics based on the input, enhancing expressiveness and content-based reasoning.\n\n2. **Selective Gating Mechanisms:**\n\n   - Introduce forget and input gates (\\( \\mathbf{f}_t \\) and \\( \\mathbf{i}_t \\)) to control information flow:\n\n     \\[\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     \\mathbf{f}_t &= \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{f} X_t + \\mathbf{U}_{f} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{b}_{f}\\right) \\\\\n     \\mathbf{i}_t &= \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{i} X_t + \\mathbf{U}_{i} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{b}_{i}\\right)\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \\]\n\n     where \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function.\n\n   - Update hidden state:\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{f}_t \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{i}_t \\odot \\tanh\\left(\\mathbf{A}(X_t) \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}(X_t) X_t\\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Gated Linear Attention:**\n\n   - Compute queries, keys, and values:\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{W}_Q X, \\quad \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{W}_K X, \\quad \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{W}_V X\n     \\]\n\n   - Apply gating mechanisms:\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{G}_Q = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{g_Q} X), \\quad \\mathbf{G}_K = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{g_K} X)\n     \\]\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{Q}' = \\mathbf{Q} \\odot \\mathbf{G}_Q, \\quad \\mathbf{K}' = \\mathbf{K} \\odot \\mathbf{G}_K\n     \\]\n\n   - Compute linear attention:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Attention}(X) = \\phi(\\mathbf{Q}') \\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{K}')^\\top \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n     where \\( \\phi \\) is a suitable activation function (e.g., ELU + 1) to ensure positivity.\n\n4. **Hierarchical Processing:**\n\n   - Stack multiple layers to process sequences at different temporal scales.\n   - Each layer captures dependencies specific to its temporal scale, allowing the model to represent complex temporal patterns effectively.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Solutions\n\n- **Increased Computational Overhead:**\n  - The addition of gating mechanisms and input-dependent parameters may slightly increase computation.\n  - **Solution:** Optimize computations through efficient implementations and leverage parallel processing capabilities.\n\n- **Model Complexity:**\n  - More parameters due to additional gates and input-dependent components.\n  - **Solution:** Parameter sharing and dimensionality reduction techniques can manage model size.\n\n- **Training Stability:**\n  - Dynamic parameters may introduce instability during training.\n  - **Solution:** Use appropriate initialization, regularization, and optimization techniques to ensure stable training.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\n- **Input:** Sequence embeddings \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\).\n- **Hierarchical Layers:** Stack \\( N \\) layers of Gated State Space Layers.\n- **Selective Gating Mechanisms:** Gates within each layer control information flow.\n- **Gated Linear Attention:** Integrated into each layer to enhance expressiveness.\n- **Output Projection:** Combine outputs from all layers to produce final output \\( Y \\).\n\n### Detailed Descriptions\n\n#### 1.
