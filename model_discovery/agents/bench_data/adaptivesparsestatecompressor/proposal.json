These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 35/59 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv:2401.04722, 2024. [40] H.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.

Compressive transformers for long-range sequence modelling.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of improving state compression in language models, focusing on low-rank approximations, efficient state representations, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key points and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Low-Rank Approximations\n\n- **Low-Rank Factorization**: This method decomposes large weight matrices into smaller, almost equivalent components. It is highly relevant for reducing the number of parameters and memory usage without heavily impacting performance. Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or matrix factorization can be applied here.\n- **Low-Rank Quantization (LRQ)**: This technique uses low-rank weight-scaling matrices for efficient model compression. It operates on block-wise reconstruction, which is beneficial for Transformer-based architectures, and ensures that the quantized weights closely approximate the original weights, preserving model integrity.\n\n## Efficient State Representations\n\n- **Selective State Updates**: Drawing from works like Mamba, which uses selective state spaces, you can update only the most relevant parts of the state. This approach minimizes unnecessary computations and memory usage. Incorporating gating mechanisms to determine which states to compress or retain can be effective[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n- **Quantized Sparse Plus Low-rank Approximation**: The SLiM method combines symmetric quantization with saliency-based low-rank approximation, reducing quantization error and leveraging sparse representations compatible with accelerated hardware architectures. This approach eliminates the need for costly retraining and enhances accuracy.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and LoRA Adaptors**: Using QAT with LoRA adaptors, as seen in the quantized Llama models, optimizes performance in low-precision environments. This approach involves simulating the effects of quantization during training and fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation, which is hardware-efficient and maintains competitive accuracy.\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Techniques like FlashAttention optimize attention mechanisms by reducing memory access overhead, which is crucial for improving computational efficiency on modern hardware. Aligning memory access patterns with hardware capabilities can significantly reduce latency and maximize throughput[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n## Additional Insights and Techniques\n\n- **Block-wise Reconstruction**: This method, used in LRQ, focuses on intra-block dependencies within the model, allowing for more accurate weight quantization. It is particularly beneficial for Transformer-based architectures.\n- **SpinQuant**: This post-training quantization technique determines the best possible combination for compression while retaining quality. It can be used for fine-tuned models or different quantization settings, offering flexibility in deployment.\n- **Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention**: The Loki method employs low-rank approximations of key-value pairs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational cost without sacrificing performance. This can be integrated into the state compression framework[Analysis Note, Section 2].\n\n## Next Steps and Proposal\n\n- **Deep Investigation into Low-Rank Algorithms**: Conduct a thorough review of specific low-rank approximation algorithms such as CUR decomposition, robust PCA, or tensor decompositions tailored for neural networks.\n- **Implementation Strategies**: Explore how to integrate these methods into the **StateCompressor** unit, ensuring compatibility with the existing architecture and optimizing for hardware efficiency.\n- **Formulate a Proposal**: Outline the modified **StateCompressor** design with enhanced state compression techniques, including low-rank approximations, selective state updates, and hardware-efficient implementations. Validate the proposal through experiments measuring the impact on training dynamics, inference speed, and model performance.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient state compression method that enhances the performance and scalability of the language model while reducing computational and memory overhead.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We propose the low-rank transformer (LRT), a memory-efficient and fast neural architecture that significantly reduces the parameters and boosts the speed of training and inference for end-to-end speech recognition. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of the network by more than 50% and speeds up the inference time by around 1.35x compared to the baseline transformer model. The experiments show that our LRT model generalizes better and yields lower error rates on both validation and test sets compared to an uncompressed transformer model. The LRT model outperforms those from existing works on several datasets in an end-to-end setting without using an external language model or acoustic data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2019, pp. 7095-7099.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multi-modal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Wenbing Li, Hang Zhou, Junqing Yu, Zikai Song, Wei Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Coupled SSM model is proposed, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes, and demonstrates that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities. However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\\%, 0.9\\%, and 2.3\\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\\% faster inference and 83.7\\% GPU memory save.

Adaptive Rank Selections for Low-Rank Approximation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Ting Hua, Yen-Chang Hsu, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework that achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants and retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Abstract:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or its weighted variants has significantly progressed in compressing language models. Previous works assume the same importance for all operations and assign the same number of ranks for different layers in a language model. However, such a uniform rank selection is sub-optimal since different operations (layers) have non-uniform demand in capacity. In other words, a desired SVD strategy should allocate more ranks for important operations and vice versa. However, a globally-optimized selection of ranks for neural networks is still an open problem, and this is a non-trivial challenge since the selection is discrete. In this work, we propose a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework. Our strategy uses a novel regularization to enable the masking to comply with the SVD property where the ranks have sorted singular values. The experiments examined both types of language models, encoder-only and decoder-only models, including large language models like LLaMA. Our compressed model achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants. More interestingly, our method retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. NysADMM: faster composite convex optimization via low-rank approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Shipu Zhao, Zachary Frangella, Madeleine Udell*\n\n**TL;DR:** The breadth of problems on which NysADMM beats standard solvers is a surprise and suggests that ADMM is a dominant paradigm for numerical optimization across a wide range of statistical learning problems that are usually solved with bespoke methods.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper develops a scalable new algorithm, called NysADMM, to minimize a smooth convex loss function with a convex regularizer. NysADMM accelerates the inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) by constructing a preconditioner for the ADMM subproblem from a randomized low-rank Nystr\u00a8om approximation. NysADMM comes with strong theoretical guarantees: it solves the ADMM subproblem in a constant number of iterations when the rank of the Nystr \u00a8 om approximation is the effective dimension of the subproblem regularized Gram matrix. In practice, ranks much smaller than the effective dimension can succeed, so NysADMM uses an adaptive strategy to choose the rank that enjoys analogous guarantees. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that NysADMM can solve important applications, such as the lasso, logistic regression, and support vector machines, in half the time (or less) required by standard solvers. The breadth of problems on which NysADMM beats standard solvers is a surprise: it suggests that ADMM is a dominant paradigm for numerical optimization across a wide range of statistical learning problems that are usually solved with bespoke methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Block Low-Rank Preconditioner with Shared Basis for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Jui-Nan Yen, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer within each layer, and designs an algorithm to maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive methods with non-diagonal preconditioning have shown state-of-the-art results on various tasks. However, their computational complexity and memory requirement make it challenging to scale these methods to modern neural network architectures. To address this challenge, some previous works have adopted block-diagonal preconditioners. However, the memory cost of storing the block-diagonal matrix remains substantial, leading to the use of smaller block sizes that ultimately leads to suboptimal performance. To reduce the time and memory complexity without sacri\ufb01cing performance, we propose approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer. We provide theoretical justi\ufb01cation for such basis sharing and design an algorithm to ef\ufb01ciently maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training. Our results on a deep autoencoder and a Transformer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms \ufb01rst-order methods with slightly more time and memory usage, while also achieving competitive or superior performance compared to other second-order methods with less time and memory usage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. How Informative is the Approximation Error from Tensor Decomposition for Neural Network Compression?\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tensor decomposition*\n\n*Jetze T. Schuurmans, Kim Batselier, Julian F. P. Kooij*\n\n**TL;DR:** The approximation error on the weights has a positive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after fine-tuning, and multiple decompositions can be considered for compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them.\n\n**Abstract:** Tensor decompositions have been successfully applied to compress neural networks. The compression algorithms using tensor decompositions commonly minimize the approximation error on the weights. Recent work assumes the approximation error on the weights is a proxy for the performance of the model to compress multiple layers and fine-tune the compressed model. Surprisingly, little research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be used to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and level of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to test if this assumption holds across different layers and types of decompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the approximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our analysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the data into account. We find the approximation error on the weights has a positive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after fine-tuning. Basing the approximation error on the features does not improve the correlation significantly. While scaling the approximation error commonly is used to account for the different sizes of layers, the average correlation across layers is smaller than across all choices (i.e. layers, decompositions, and level of compression) before fine-tuning. When calculating the correlation across the different decompositions, the average rank correlation is larger than across all choices. This means multiple decompositions can be considered for compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. High-Order Pooling for Graph Neural Networks with Tensor Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tensor decomposition*\n\n*Chenqing Hua, Guillaume Rabusseau, Jian Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Theoretical and empirical analysis on both node and graph classification tasks show the superiority of tGNN over competitive baselines, a highly expressive GNN architecture relying on tensor decomposition to model high-order non-linear node interactions.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are attracting growing attention due to their effectiveness and flexibility in modeling a variety of graph-structured data. Exiting GNN architectures usually adopt simple pooling operations (eg. sum, average, max) when aggregating messages from a local neighborhood for updating node representation or pooling node representations from the entire graph to compute the graph representation. Though simple and effective, these linear operations do not model high-order non-linear interactions among nodes. We propose the Tensorized Graph Neural Network (tGNN), a highly expressive GNN architecture relying on tensor decomposition to model high-order non-linear node interactions. tGNN leverages the symmetric CP decomposition to efficiently parameterize permutation-invariant multilinear maps for modeling node interactions. Theoretical and empirical analysis on both node and graph classification tasks show the superiority of tGNN over competitive baselines. In particular, tGNN achieves the most solid results on two OGB node classification datasets and one OGB graph classification dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Dynamic Tensor Decomposition via Neural Diffusion-Reaction Processes\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tensor decomposition*\n\n*Zheng Wang, Shikai Fang, Shibo Li, Shandian Zhe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a neural diffusion-reaction process to estimate dynamic embeddings for the entities in each tensor mode and proposes a stratified sampling method to balance the cost of processing each mini-batch so as to improve the overall efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Tensor decomposition is an important tool for multiway data analysis. In practice, the data is often sparse yet associated with rich temporal information. Existing methods, however, often under-use the time information and ignore the structural knowledge within the sparsely observed tensor entries. To overcome these limitations and to better capture the underlying temporal structure, we propose Dynamic EMbedIngs fOr dynamic Tensor dEcomposition (DEMOTE). We develop a neural diffusion-reaction process to estimate dynamic embeddings for the entities in each tensor mode. Specifically, based on the observed tensor entries, we build a multi-partite graph to encode the correlation between the entities. We construct a graph diffusion process to co-evolve the embedding trajectories of the correlated entities and use a neural network to construct a reaction process for each individual entity. In this way, our model can capture both the commonalities and personalities during the evolution of the embeddings for different entities. We then use a neural network to model the entry value as a nonlinear function of the embedding trajectories. For model estimation, we combine ODE solvers to develop a stochastic mini-batch learning algorithm. We propose a stratified sampling method to balance the cost of processing each mini-batch so as to improve the overall efficiency. We show the advantage of our approach in both simulation study and real-world applications.

WoodFisher: Efficient Second-Order Approximation for Neural Network Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural network compression*\n\n*Sidak Pal Singh, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that WoodFisher significantly outperforms popular state-of-the-art methods for one-shot pruning and can be extended to take into account first-order information, as well as illustrate its ability to automatically set layer-wise pruning thresholds and perform compression in the limited-data regime.\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order information, in the form of Hessian- or Inverse-Hessian-vector products, is a fundamental tool for solving optimization problems. Recently, there has been significant interest in utilizing this information in the context of deep neural networks; however, relatively little is known about the quality of existing approximations in this context. Our work examines this question, identifies issues with existing approaches, and proposes a method called WoodFisher to compute a faithful and efficient estimate of the inverse Hessian. \nOur main application is to neural network compression, where we build on the classic Optimal Brain Damage/Surgeon framework. We demonstrate that WoodFisher significantly outperforms popular state-of-the-art methods for one-shot pruning. Further, even when iterative, gradual pruning is considered, our method results in a gain in test accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches, for pruning popular neural networks (like ResNet-50, MobileNetV1) trained on standard image classification datasets such as ImageNet ILSVRC. We examine how our method can be extended to take into account first-order information, as well as illustrate its ability to automatically set layer-wise pruning thresholds and perform compression in the limited-data regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 139  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 8. DKM: Differentiable K-Means Clustering Layer for Neural Network Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural network compression*\n\n*Minsik Cho, Keivan Alizadeh-Vahid, Saurabh N. Adya, Mohammad Rastegari*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression and demonstrates that DKM delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural network (DNN) model compression for efficient on-device inference is becoming increasingly important to reduce memory requirements and keep user data on-device. To this end, we propose a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression. DKM casts k-means clustering as an attention problem and enables joint optimization of the DNN parameters and clustering centroids. Unlike prior works that rely on additional regularizers and parameters, DKM-based compression keeps the original loss function and model architecture fixed. We evaluated DKM-based compression on various DNN models for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our results demonstrate that DKM delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks. For example, DKM-based compression can offer 74.5% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy on ResNet50 DNN model with 3.3MB model size (29.4x model compression factor). For MobileNet-v1, which is a challenging DNN to compress, DKM delivers 63.9% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy with 0.72 MB model size (22.4x model compression factor). This result is 6.8% higher top-1accuracy and 33% relatively smaller model size than the current state-of-the-art DNN compression algorithms. Additionally, DKM enables compression of DistilBERT model by 11.8x with minimal (1.1%) accuracy loss on GLUE NLP benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 9. Learnable Embedding Space for Efficient Neural Architecture Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural network compression*\n\n*Shengcao Cao, Xiaofang Wang, Kris M. Kitani*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the learned embedding space can be transferred to new settings for architecture search, such as a larger teacher network or a teacher network in a different architecture family, without any training.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a method to incrementally learn an embedding space over the domain of network architectures, to enable the careful selection of architectures for evaluation during compressed architecture search. Given a teacher network, we search for a compressed network architecture by using Bayesian Optimization (BO) with a kernel function defined over our proposed embedding space to select architectures for evaluation. We demonstrate that our search algorithm can significantly outperform various baseline methods, such as random search and reinforcement learning (Ashok et al., 2018). The compressed architectures found by our method are also better than the state-of-the-art manually-designed compact architecture ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018). We also demonstrate that the learned embedding space can be transferred to new settings for architecture search, such as a larger teacher network or a teacher network in a different architecture family, without any training.

LoRA-GA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Jian Li, Linxi Yu, Shaowen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. LoRA, as one of the most popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by fine-tuning an auxiliary low-rank model that has significantly fewer parameters. Although LoRA reduces the computational and memory requirements significantly at each iteration, extensive empirical evidence indicates that it converges at a considerably slower rate compared to full fine-tuning, ultimately leading to increased overall compute and often worse test performance. In our paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the initialization method of LoRA and show that careful initialization (without any change of the architecture and the training algorithm) can significantly enhance both efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce a novel initialization method, LoRA-GA (Low Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation), which aligns the gradients of low-rank matrix product with those of full fine-tuning at the first step. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-GA achieves a convergence rate comparable to that of full fine-tuning (hence being significantly faster than vanilla LoRA as well as various recent improvements) while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the subset of the GLUE dataset with T5-Base, LoRA-GA outperforms LoRA by 5.69% on average. On larger models such as Llama 2-7B, LoRA-GA shows performance improvements of 0.34, 11.52%, and 5.05% on MT-bench, GSM8K, and Human-eval, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 2-4 times convergence speed improvement compared to vanilla LoRA, validating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and enhancing model performance.

H2OPUS-TLR: High Performance Tile Low Rank Symmetric Factorizations using Adaptive Randomized Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Tile low rank representations of dense matrices partition them into blocks of roughly uniform size, where each off-diagonal tile is compressed and stored as its own low rank factorization. They offer an attractive representation for many data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where substantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved. TLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular perfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced trees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient performance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned to take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory hierarchy. There are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky and $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs. The difficulties in achieving high performance when factoring TLR matrices come from the expensive compression operations that must be performed during the factorization process and the adaptive rank distribution of the tiles that causes an irregular work pattern for the processing cores. In this work, we develop a dynamic batching operation and combine it with batched adaptive randomized approximations to achieve high performance both on GPUs and CPUs. Our implementation attains over 1.2 TFLOP/s in double precision on the V100 GPU, and is limited by the performance of batched GEMM operations. The Cholesky factorization of covariance matrix of size $N = 131K$ arising in spatial statistics can be factored to an accuracy $\\epsilon=10^{-2}$ in just a few seconds. We believe the proposed GEMM-centric algorithm allows it to be readily ported to newer hardware such as the tensor cores that are optimized for small GEMM operations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. CP-decomposition with Tensor Power Method for Convolutional Neural Networks Compression\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tensor decomposition*\n\n*Seung-Ik Lee, Marcella Astrid*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has shown a great success in many areas\nincluding complex image classification tasks. However, they need a lot of\nmemory and computational cost, which hinders them from running in relatively\nlow-end smart devices such as smart phones. We propose a CNN compression method\nbased on CP-decomposition and Tensor Power Method. We also propose an iterative\nfine tuning, with which we fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each\nlayer, but before decomposing the next layer.

Exploring Unexplored Tensor Network Decompositions for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tensor decomposition*\n\n*Shin-ichi Maeda, Yohei Sugawara, Taiki Yamaguchi, Kohei Hayashi*\n\n**Abstract:** Tensor decomposition methods are widely used for model compression and fast inference in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although many decompositions are conceivable, only CP decomposition and a few others have been applied in practice, and no extensive comparisons have been made between available methods. Previous studies have not determined how many decompositions are available, nor which of them is optimal. In this study, we first characterize a decomposition class specific to CNNs by adopting a flexible graphical notation. The class includes such well-known CNN modules as depthwise separable convolution layers and bottleneck layers, but also previously unknown modules with nonlinear activations. We also experimentally compare the tradeoff between prediction accuracy and time/space complexity for modules found by enumerating all possible decompositions, or by using a neural architecture search. We find some nonlinear decompositions outperform existing ones.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. EIE: Efficient Inference Engine on Compressed Deep Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural network compression*\n\n*Ardavan Pedram, Xingyu Liu, William J. Dally, Mark A. Horowitz, Huizi Mao, Song Han, Jing Pu*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have hundreds of millions of\nconnections and are both computationally and memory intensive, making them\ndifficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and\npower budgets. While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights\nfrom DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and\ndominates the required power.\n  Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs\n(AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by\npruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the\nsame weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that\nperforms inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the\nresulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from\nDRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving; Exploiting sparsity saves 10x;\nWeight sharing gives 8x; Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x.\nEvaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to\nCPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a\nprocessing power of 102GOPS/s working directly on a compressed network,\ncorresponding to 3TOPS/s on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of\nAlexNet at 1.88x10^4 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW.

Permute, Quantize, and Fine-tune: Efficient Compression of Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient neural network compression*\n\n*Raquel Urtasun, Wenyuan Zeng, Ioan Andrei B\u00e2rsan, Ting Wei Liu, Jashan Shewakramani, Julieta Martinez*\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing large neural networks is an important step for their deployment in resource-constrained computational platforms. In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% with respect to the current state of the art.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing state compression in language models using advanced low-rank approximation techniques, tensor decompositions, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key insights and references that are particularly relevant:\n\n### Adaptive Low-Rank Approximation\n\n- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: This technique is widely recognized for its efficiency in fine-tuning large neural networks by reducing the number of trainable parameters.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Score: 0.70)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/74 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nThis validates our core motivation in Sections 3.1 and 3.3. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe discuss related work, limitations, and some future directions. Related Work. Appendix A discusses how the selection mechanism relates to similar concepts. Appendix B has an extended related work of SSMs and other related models. Table 9: (Ablations: Expressivity of $\\Delta$. ) The selection mechanism of $\\Delta$ constructs it with a projection of the input. Projecting it even to dim. 1 provides a large increase in performance; increasing it further provides further improvements at the cost of a modest increase in parameters.

(Top) Constant $\\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\\boldsymbol{C}$ (Bottom) Selective $B$ and $C$. Increasing the SSM state dimension $N$, which can be viewed as an expansion factor on the dimension of the recurrent state, can significantly improve performance for a negligible cost in parameters/FLOPs, but only when $\\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\\boldsymbol{C}$ are also selective. Size of $\\Delta$ projection fixed to 64 . No Free Lunch: Continuous-Discrete Spectrum. Structured SSMs were originally defined as discretizations of continuous systems (1), and have had a strong inductive bias toward continuous-time data modalities such as perceptual signals (e.g. audio, video). As discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.5, the selection mechanism overcomes their weaknesses on discrete modalities such as text and DNA; but this conversely can impede their performance on data that LTI SSMs excel on. Our ablations on audio waveforms examine this tradeoff in more detail. Downstream Affordances. Transformer-based foundation models (particularly LLMs) have a rich ecosystem of properties and modes of interaction with pretrained models, such as fine-tuning, adaptation, prompting, in-context learning, instruction tuning, RLHF, quantization, and so on. We are particularly interested in whether Transformer alternatives such as SSMs have similar properties and affordances. Scaling. Our empirical evaluation is limited to small model sizes, below the threshold of most strong open source LLMs (e.g. Llama (Touvron et al. 2023)) as well as other recurrent models such as RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) and RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023), which have been evaluated at the 7B parameter scale and beyond. It remains to assess whether Mamba still compares favorably at these larger sizes. We also note that scaling SSMs may involve further engineering challenges and adjustments to the model that are not discussed in this paper. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe introduce a selection mechanism to structured state space models, allowing them to perform context-dependent reasoning while scaling linearly in sequence length. When incorporated into a simple attention-free architecture, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of domains, where it matches or exceeds the performance of strong Transformer models. We are excited about the broad applications of selective state space models to build foundation models for different domains, especially in emerging modalities requiring long context such as genomics, audio, and video. Our results suggest that Mamba is a strong candidate to be a general sequence model backbone. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Karan Goel, Arjun Desai, and Kush Bhatia for helpful feedback on the draft. ## References\n\n[1] Martin Arjovsky, Amar Shah, and Yoshua Bengio. \"Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks\".

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.30)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training.

Debiased Distribution Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank compression*\n\n*Lingxiao Li, Raaz Dwivedi, Lester Mackey*\n\n**TL;DR:** New suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences are introduced, providing succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein kernel thinning (SKT) returns $\\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\\mathbb{P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\\text{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. DRONE: Data-aware Low-rank Compression for Large NLP Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank compression*\n\n*Patrick H. Chen, Hsiang-Fu Yu, I. Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** DRONE is proposed, a provably optimal low-rank decomposition of weight matrices, which has a simple closed form solution that can be ef\ufb01ciently computed and is able to improve both model size and inference speed with limited loss in accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** The representations learned by large-scale NLP models such as BERT have been widely used in various tasks. However, the increasing model size of the pre-trained models also brings ef\ufb01ciency challenges, including inference speed and model size when deploying models on mobile devices. Speci\ufb01cally, most operations in BERT consist of matrix multiplications. These matrices are not low-rank and thus canonical matrix decompositions do not lead to ef\ufb01cient approximations. In this paper, we observe that the learned representation of each layer lies in a low-dimensional space. Based on this observation, we propose DRONE ( d ata-awa r e l o w-ra n k compr e ssion), a provably optimal low-rank decomposition of weight matrices, which has a simple closed form solution that can be ef\ufb01ciently computed. DRONE can be applied to both fully-connected and self-attention layers appearing in the BERT model. In addition to compressing standard models, our method can also be used on distilled BERT models to further improve the compression rate. Experimental results show that DRONE is able to improve both model size and inference speed with limited loss in accuracy. Speci\ufb01cally, DRONE alone achieves 1.92x speedup on the MRPC task with only 1.5 % loss in accuracy, and when DRONE is combined with distillation, it further achieves over 12.3x speedup on various natural language inference tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. LoSparse: Structured Compression of Large Language Models based on Low-Rank and Sparse Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank compression*\n\n*Yixiao Li, Yifan Yu, Qingru Zhang, Chen Liang, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, which significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved remarkable results in various natural language tasks, but they are often prohibitively large, requiring massive memories and computational resources. To reduce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation prevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation tasks. We show that it significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: selective state-space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 39*)\n\n#### 5. Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: selective state-space models*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: selective state-space models*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient tensor decompositions*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient tensor decompositions*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient tensor decompositions*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Low-Rank Instance Adaptation for Universal Neural Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank compression*\n\n*Wei Yang, Xiao Han, Wenming Yang, Jun Zhang, Jinxi Xiang, Yue Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** The latest advancements in neural image compression show great potential in surpassing the rate-distortion performance of conventional standard codecs. Nevertheless, there exists an indelible domain gap between the datasets utilized for training (i.e., natural images) and those utilized for inference (e.g., artistic images). Our proposal involves a low-rank adaptation approach aimed at addressing the rate-distortion drop observed in out-of-domain datasets. Specifically, we perform low-rank matrix decomposition to update certain adaptation parameters of the client's decoder. These updated parameters, along with image latents, are encoded into a bitstream and transmitted to the decoder in practical scenarios. Due to the low-rank constraint imposed on the adaptation parameters, the resulting bit rate overhead is small. Furthermore, the bit rate allocation of low-rank adaptation is \\emph{non-trivial}, considering the diverse inputs require varying adaptation bitstreams. We thus introduce a dynamic gating network on top of the low-rank adaptation method, in order to decide which decoder layer should employ adaptation. The dynamic adaptation network is optimized end-to-end using rate-distortion loss. Our proposed method exhibits universality across diverse image datasets. Extensive results demonstrate that this paradigm significantly mitigates the domain gap, surpassing non-adaptive methods with an average BD-rate improvement of approximately $19\\%$ across out-of-domain images. Furthermore, it outperforms the most advanced instance adaptive methods by roughly $5\\%$ BD-rate. Ablation studies confirm our method's ability to universally enhance various image compression architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning & Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank compression*\n\n*Qing Qu, Laura Balzano, Peng Wang, Can Yaras*\n\n**Abstract:** While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called \"Deep LoRA\", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: selective state-space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: selective state-space models*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets.

R. Ruiz, Alexander Novikov, Mohammadamin Barekatain, Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Thomas Hubert, Aja Huang, Matej Balog, Alhussein Fawzi*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems\u2014from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor\u2019s algorithm improves on Strassen\u2019s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor\u2019s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.\n\n**Proceeding:** nature-2022-10\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. TOD: GPU-accelerated Outlier Detection via Tensor Operations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient tensor decompositions*\n\n*Zhihao Jia, George H. Chen, Yue Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Outlier detection (OD) is a key learning task for finding rare and deviant data samples, with many time-critical applications such as fraud detection and intrusion detection. In this work, we propose TOD, the first tensor-based system for efficient and scalable outlier detection on distributed multi-GPU machines. A key idea behind TOD is decomposing complex OD applications into a small collection of basic tensor algebra operators. This decomposition enables TOD to accelerate OD computations by leveraging recent advances in deep learning infrastructure in both hardware and software. Moreover, to deploy memory-intensive OD applications on modern GPUs with limited on-device memory, we introduce two key techniques. First, provable quantization speeds up OD computations and reduces its memory footprint by automatically performing specific floating-point operations in lower precision while provably guaranteeing no accuracy loss. Second, to exploit the aggregated compute resources and memory capacity of multiple GPUs, we introduce automatic batching, which decomposes OD computations into small batches for both sequential execution on a single GPU and parallel execution on multiple GPUs. TOD supports a diverse set of OD algorithms. Extensive evaluation on 11 real and 3 synthetic OD datasets shows that TOD is on average 10.9x faster than the leading CPU-based OD system PyOD (with a maximum speedup of 38.9x), and can handle much larger datasets than existing GPU-based OD systems. In addition, TOD allows easy integration of new OD operators, enabling fast prototyping of emerging and yet-to-discovered OD algorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To enhance the **StateCompressor** unit within the **SparseStateGAU** design, the researcher is focusing on integrating several key techniques: adaptive low-rank approximations, selective state-space models, dense connections, and hardware-efficient implementations.

Leveraging convolutional operations within the **StateCompressor** could benefit from existing hardware optimizations for convolutions, enhancing computational efficiency and parallelism[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Optimization Techniques**: Recent advances in optimization, such as the use of local curvature information and adaptive stepsizes (e.g., LCD methods), can enhance the convergence and efficiency of the training process. These techniques can be integrated into the training of the **StateCompressor** to improve its performance and stability.\n\n### Implementation Strategies and Potential Challenges\n\n- **Balancing Compression and Performance**: A key challenge is to ensure that the compression does not significantly impact the model's performance. Techniques like regularization and careful initialization can help maintain model stability during compression.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimization**: Aligning compression techniques with hardware capabilities is crucial. IO-aware algorithms and memory-efficient computations, as demonstrated in **FlashAttention**, can be integrated into the **StateCompressor** to enhance practical efficiency[Analysis Note, Section 6].\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Detailed Implementation Strategies**: Research how to integrate dense connections with adaptive low-rank compression, and explore existing implementations or studies that combine these techniques.\n- **Advanced Compression Techniques**: Investigate tensor decomposition methods applied to state representations in language models and assess the feasibility of using extensible embeddings for compressed state representations.\n- **Experimental Validation**: Design experiments to evaluate the impact of the proposed modifications on model performance, memory usage, and computational efficiency, and compare the modified **StateCompressor** against baseline models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient **StateCompressor** unit that enhances the overall performance and efficiency of the **SparseStateGAU** design.\n",

Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, R. Salakhutdinov*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2019)\t**Cited by** 3248  (*Influential: 394*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence, which consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nMultiMedia LLC. 2009.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/68 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nURL http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Compressing Neural Networks: Towards Determining the Optimal Layer-wise Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: \"error bounds compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Lucas Liebenwein, Alaa Maalouf, O. Gal, Dan Feldman, Daniela Rus*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel global compression framework for deep neural networks that automatically analyzes each layer to identify the optimal per-layer compression ratio, while simultaneously achieving the desired overall compression. Our algorithm hinges on the idea of compressing each convolutional (or fully-connected) layer by slicing its channels into multiple groups and decomposing each group via low-rank decomposition. At the core of our algorithm is the derivation of layer-wise error bounds from the Eckart Young Mirsky theorem. We then leverage these bounds to frame the compression problem as an optimization problem where we wish to minimize the maximum compression error across layers and propose an efficient algorithm towards a solution. Our experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing low-rank compression approaches across a wide range of networks and data sets. We believe that our results open up new avenues for future research into the global performance-size trade-offs of modern neural networks.

As a popular compression technique, quantization constrains the number of distinct weight values and thus reducing the number of bits required to represent and store each weight. In this paper, we study the representation power of quantized neural networks. First, we prove the universal approximability of quantized ReLU networks on a wide class of functions. Then we provide upper bounds on the number of weights and the memory size for a given approximation error bound and the bit-width of weights for function-independent and function-dependent structures. Our results reveal that, to attain an approximation error bound of $\\epsilon$, the number of weights needed by a quantized network is no more than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log^5(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ times that of an unquantized network. This overhead is of much lower order than the lower bound of the number of weights needed for the error bound, supporting the empirical success of various quantization techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the complexity bounds of quantized neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Error Analysis Prompting Enables Human-Like Translation Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Case Study on ChatGPT\n\n*From Search Query: \"integration case studies language models\"*\n\n*Qingyu Lu, Baopu Qiu, Liang Ding, Liping Xie, Dacheng Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Findings highlight the potential of EAPrompt as a human-like evaluator prompting technique for MT evaluation, and investigate several prompting designs, and propose a new prompting method called EAPrompt by combining Chain-of-Thoughts and Error Analysis.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across several NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization. Recent research (Kocmi and Federmann, 2023) has shown that utilizing LLMs for assessing the quality of machine translation (MT) achieves state-of-the-art performance at the system level but \\textit{performs poorly at the segment level}. To further improve the performance of LLMs on MT quality assessment, we investigate several prompting designs, and propose a new prompting method called \\textbf{\\texttt{Error Analysis Prompting}} (EAPrompt) by combining Chain-of-Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022) and Error Analysis (Lu et al., 2023). This technique emulates the commonly accepted human evaluation framework - Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM, Freitag et al. (2021)) and \\textit{produces explainable and reliable MT evaluations at both the system and segment level}. Experimental Results from the WMT22 metrics shared task validate the effectiveness of EAPrompt on various LLMs, with different structures. Further analysis confirms that EAPrompt effectively distinguishes major errors from minor ones, while also sharing a similar distribution of the number of errors with MQM. These findings highlight the potential of EAPrompt as a human-like evaluator prompting technique for MT evaluation.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. BiBench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Network Binarization\n\n*From Search Query: \"performance benchmarking compression\"*\n\n*Haotong Qin, Mingyuan Zhang, Yifu Ding, Aoyu Li, Zhongang Cai, Ziwei Liu, F. Yu, Xianglong Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization, and reveals that the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability ofbinarized networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Network binarization emerges as one of the most promising compression approaches offering extraordinary computation and memory savings by minimizing the bit-width. However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The results and analysis also lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and efficient binarization. We believe that BiBench will contribute to the broader adoption of binarization and serve as a foundation for future research.

Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning with Communication Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"performance benchmarking compression\"*\n\n*Xinmeng Huang, Ping Li, Xiaoyun Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper revisits the seminal stochastic controlled averaging method by proposing an equivalent but more efficient/simplified formulation with halved uplink communication costs and proposes two compressed FL algorithms, SCALLION and SCAFCOM, to support unbiased and biased compression, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Communication compression, a technique aiming to reduce the information volume to be transmitted over the air, has gained great interests in Federated Learning (FL) for the potential of alleviating its communication overhead. However, communication compression brings forth new challenges in FL due to the interplay of compression-incurred information distortion and inherent characteristics of FL such as partial participation and data heterogeneity. Despite the recent development, the performance of compressed FL approaches has not been fully exploited. The existing approaches either cannot accommodate arbitrary data heterogeneity or partial participation, or require stringent conditions on compression. In this paper, we revisit the seminal stochastic controlled averaging method by proposing an equivalent but more efficient/simplified formulation with halved uplink communication costs. Building upon this implementation, we propose two compressed FL algorithms, SCALLION and SCAFCOM, to support unbiased and biased compression, respectively. Both the proposed methods outperform the existing compressed FL methods in terms of communication and computation complexities. Moreover, SCALLION and SCAFCOM accommodates arbitrary data heterogeneity and do not make any additional assumptions on compression errors. Experiments show that SCALLION and SCAFCOM can match the performance of corresponding full-precision FL approaches with substantially reduced uplink communication, and outperform recent compressed FL methods under the same communication budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 162  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Neural Machine Translation with 4-Bit Precision and Beyond\n\n*From Search Query: \"error bounds compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Alham Fikri Aji, Kenneth Heafield*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is resource intensive. We design a\nquantization procedure to compress NMT models better for devices with limited\nhardware capability. Because most neural network parameters are near zero, we\nemploy logarithmic quantization in lieu of fixed-point quantization. However,\nwe find bias terms are less amenable to log quantization but note they comprise\na tiny fraction of the model, so we leave them uncompressed. We also propose to\nuse an error-feedback mechanism during retraining, to preserve the compressed\nmodel as a stale gradient. We empirically show that NMT models based on\nTransformer or RNN architecture can be compressed up to 4-bit precision without\nany noticeable quality degradation. Models can be compressed up to binary\nprecision, albeit with lower quality. The RNN architecture seems to be more\nrobust to quantization, compared to the Transformer.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-13T08:55:08Z  (*Updated: 2019-09-20T17:26:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Theory of Unsupervised Translation Motivated by Understanding Animal\n  Communication\n\n*From Search Query: \"error bounds compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Shafi Goldwasser, David F. Gruber, Adam Tauman Kalai, Orr Paradise*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are capable of translating between languages -- in some cases\neven between two languages where there is little or no access to parallel\ntranslations, in what is known as Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT). Given\nthis progress, it is intriguing to ask whether machine learning tools can\nultimately enable understanding animal communication, particularly that of\nhighly intelligent animals. We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing\nUMT when no parallel translations are available and when it cannot be assumed\nthat the source and target corpora address related subject domains or posses\nsimilar linguistic structure. We exemplify this theory with two stylized models\nof language, for which our framework provides bounds on necessary sample\ncomplexity; the bounds are formally proven and experimentally verified on\nsynthetic data. These bounds show that the error rates are inversely related to\nthe language complexity and amount of common ground. This suggests that\nunsupervised translation of animal communication may be feasible if the\ncommunication system is sufficiently complex.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-20T20:55:38Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-03T18:15:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Data Selection Approach for Enhancing Low Resource Machine Translation\n  Using Cross-Lingual Sentence Representations\n\n*From Search Query: \"integration case studies language models\"*\n\n*Nidhi Kowtal, Tejas Deshpande, Raviraj Joshi*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine translation in low-resource language pairs faces significant\nchallenges due to the scarcity of parallel corpora and linguistic resources.\nThis study focuses on the case of English-Marathi language pairs, where\nexisting datasets are notably noisy, impeding the performance of machine\ntranslation models. To mitigate the impact of data quality issues, we propose a\ndata filtering approach based on cross-lingual sentence representations. Our\nmethodology leverages a multilingual SBERT model to filter out problematic\ntranslations in the training data. Specifically, we employ an IndicSBERT\nsimilarity model to assess the semantic equivalence between original and\ntranslated sentences, allowing us to retain linguistically correct translations\nwhile discarding instances with substantial deviations. The results demonstrate\na significant improvement in translation quality over the baseline\npost-filtering with IndicSBERT. This illustrates how cross-lingual sentence\nrepresentations can reduce errors in machine translation scenarios with limited\nresources. By integrating multilingual sentence BERT models into the\ntranslation pipeline, this research contributes to advancing machine\ntranslation techniques in low-resource environments. The proposed method not\nonly addresses the challenges in English-Marathi language pairs but also\nprovides a valuable framework for enhancing translation quality in other\nlow-resource language translation tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-04T13:49:45Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-04T13:49:45Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. On Significance of Subword tokenization for Low Resource and Efficient\n  Named Entity Recognition: A case study in Marathi\n\n*From Search Query: \"integration case studies language models\"*\n\n*Harsh Chaudhari, Anuja Patil, Dhanashree Lavekar, Pranav Khairnar, Raviraj Joshi, Sachin Pande*\n\n**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems play a vital role in NLP applications\nsuch as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering. These\nsystems identify named entities, which encompass real-world concepts like\nlocations, persons, and organizations. Despite extensive research on NER\nsystems for the English language, they have not received adequate attention in\nthe context of low resource languages. In this work, we focus on NER for\nlow-resource language and present our case study in the context of the Indian\nlanguage Marathi. The advancement of NLP research revolves around the\nutilization of pre-trained transformer models such as BERT for the development\nof NER models. However, we focus on improving the performance of shallow models\nbased on CNN, and LSTM by combining the best of both worlds. In the era of\ntransformers, these traditional deep learning models are still relevant because\nof their high computational efficiency. We propose a hybrid approach for\nefficient NER by integrating a BERT-based subword tokenizer into vanilla\nCNN/LSTM models. We show that this simple approach of replacing a traditional\nword-based tokenizer with a BERT-tokenizer brings the accuracy of vanilla\nsingle-layer models closer to that of deep pre-trained models like BERT. We\nshow the importance of using sub-word tokenization for NER and present our\nstudy toward building efficient NLP systems.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text\n\n*From Search Query: \"performance benchmarking compression\"*\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs)\nover highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by\na small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of\ncompression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally\ncompressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving\nefficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to\nthis goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are\nnot well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively\ncompressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome\nthis, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text\nis segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this\nmethod, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that\nimproves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on\nperplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse\nperplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter\ncount, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths\nrequire fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we\nprovide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability,\nand offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\nhigh-compression tokenizers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-04T17:48:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-13T22:01:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Compress, Then Prompt: Improving Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off of LLM\n  Inference with Transferable Prompt\n\n*From Search Query: \"performance benchmarking compression\"*\n\n*Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Beidi Chen, Yuxin Tang, Jue Wang, Kaixiong Zhou, Xia Hu, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**Abstract:** While the numerous parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute to\ntheir superior performance, this massive scale makes them inefficient and\nmemory-hungry. Thus, they are hard to deploy on commodity hardware, such as one\nsingle GPU. Given the memory and power constraints of such devices, model\ncompression methods are widely employed to reduce both the model size and\ninference latency, which essentially trades off model quality in return for\nimproved efficiency. Thus, optimizing this accuracy-efficiency trade-off is\ncrucial for the LLM deployment on commodity hardware. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new perspective to optimize this trade-off by prompting compressed\nmodels. Specifically, we first observe that for certain questions, the\ngeneration quality of a compressed LLM can be significantly improved by adding\ncarefully designed hard prompts, though this isn't the case for all questions.\nBased on this observation, we propose a soft prompt learning method where we\nexpose the compressed model to the prompt learning process, aiming to enhance\nthe performance of prompts. Our experimental analysis suggests our soft prompt\nstrategy greatly improves the performance of the 8x compressed LLaMA-7B model\n(with a joint 4-bit quantization and 50% weight pruning compression), allowing\nthem to match their uncompressed counterparts on popular benchmarks. Also, we\ndemonstrate that these learned prompts can be transferred across various\ndatasets, tasks, and compression levels. Hence with this transferability, we\ncan stitch the soft prompt to a newly compressed model to improve the test-time\naccuracy in an ``in-situ'' way.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-17T20:45:13Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-10T04:01:30Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DeepSZ: A Novel Framework to Compress Deep Neural Networks by Using Error-Bounded Lossy Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"error bounds compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Franck Cappello, Jiannan Tian, Xin Liang, Sheng Di, Sian Jin, Dingwen Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** DNNs have been quickly and broadly exploited to improve the data analysis\nquality in many complex science and engineering applications. Today's DNNs are\nbecoming deeper and wider because of increasing demand on the analysis quality\nand more and more complex applications to resolve. The wide and deep DNNs,\nhowever, require large amounts of resources, significantly restricting their\nutilization on resource-constrained systems. Although some network\nsimplification methods have been proposed to address this issue, they suffer\nfrom either low compression ratios or high compression errors, which may\nintroduce a costly retraining process for the target accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepSZ: an accuracy-loss bounded neural network compression\nframework, which involves four key steps: network pruning, error bound\nassessment, optimization for error bound configuration, and compressed model\ngeneration, featuring a high compression ratio and low encoding time. The\ncontribution is three-fold. (1) We develop an adaptive approach to select the\nfeasible error bounds for each layer. (2) We build a model to estimate the\noverall loss of accuracy based on the accuracy degradation caused by individual\ndecompressed layers. (3) We develop an efficient optimization algorithm to\ndetermine the best-fit configuration of error bounds in order to maximize the\ncompression ratio under the user-set accuracy constraint. Experiments show that\nDeepSZ can compress AlexNet and VGG-16 on the ImageNet by a compression ratio\nof 46X and 116X, respectively, and compress LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 on the\nMNIST by a compression ratio of 57X and 56X, respectively, with only up to 0.3%\nloss of accuracy. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, DeepSZ can\nimprove the compression ratio by up to 1.43X, the DNN encoding performance by\nup to 4.0X (with four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs), and the decoding performance by\nup to 6.2X.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Spectral Pruning for Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"error bounds compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Tomohiro Daimon, Ryuji Saiin, Hiroyuki Kusumoto, Koichi Taniguchi, Kazuma Suetake, Takashi Furuya*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks used in sequential tasks. However, in general, RNNs have a large number of parameters and involve enormous computational costs by repeating the recurrent structures in many time steps. As a method to overcome this difficulty, RNN pruning has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and it brings us benefits in terms of the reduction of computational cost as the time step progresses. However, most existing methods of RNN pruning are heuristic. The purpose of this paper is to study the theoretical scheme for RNN pruning method. We propose an appropriate pruning algorithm for RNNs inspired by \"spectral pruning\", and provide the generalization error bounds for compressed RNNs. We also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical results and show the effectiveness of our pruning method compared with existing methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We introduce LM Assertions, a programming construct for expressing computational constraints that LMs should satisfy. We integrate our constructs into the recent DSPy programming model for LMs, and present new strategies that allow DSPy to compile programs with LM Assertions into more reliable and accurate systems. We also propose strategies to use assertions at inference time for automatic self-refinement with LMs. We report on four diverse case studies for text generation and find that LM Assertions improve not only compliance with imposed rules but also downstream task performance, passing constraints up to 164% more often and generating up to 37% more higher-quality responses.

Gonzalez, Martin Casado, Aaron Hao, Roy Huang, Noppapon C., Vivian Fang, Tianjun Zhang, Shishir G. Patil*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services. Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future. We argue that in many cases, \"post-facto validation\" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned \"pre-facto validation\" setting. The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks. Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement. We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision.

This optimal subset, which we refer to as \"Bort\", is demonstrably smaller, having an effective (that is, not counting the embedding layer) size of $5.5\\%$ the original BERT-large architecture, and $16\\%$ of the net size. Bort is also able to be pretrained in $288$ GPU hours, which is $1.2\\%$ of the time required to pretrain the highest-performing BERT parametric architectural variant, RoBERTa-large (Liu et al., 2019), and about $33\\%$ of that of the world-record, in GPU hours, required to train BERT-large on the same hardware. It is also $7.9$x faster on a CPU, as well as being better performing than other compressed variants of the architecture, and some of the non-compressed variants: it obtains performance improvements of between $0.3\\%$ and $31\\%$, absolute, with respect to BERT-large, on multiple public natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. COMISR: Compression-Informed Video Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"performance benchmarking compression\"*\n\n*Peyman Milanfar, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Ce Liu, Feng Yang, Pengchong Jin, Yinxiao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Most video super-resolution methods focus on restoring high-resolution video frames from low-resolution videos without taking into account compression. However, most videos on the web or mobile devices are compressed, and the compression can be severe when the bandwidth is limited. In this paper, we propose a new compression-informed video super-resolution model to restore high-resolution content without introducing artifacts caused by compression. The proposed model consists of three modules for video super-resolution: bi-directional recurrent warping, detail-preserving flow estimation, and Laplacian enhancement. All these three modules are used to deal with compression properties such as the location of the intra-frames in the input and smoothness in the output frames. For thorough performance evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on standard datasets with a wide range of compression rates, covering many real video use cases. We showed that our method not only recovers high-resolution content on uncompressed frames from the widely-used benchmark datasets, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in super-resolving compressed videos based on numerous quantitative metrics. We also evaluated the proposed method by simulating streaming from YouTube to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

This is well-explained in the context of model distillation, where the compression threshold dictates the balance between model size and accuracy. Setting this threshold involves evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall after compression.\n- Error-bounded lossy compression algorithms provide mathematical guarantees by ensuring that the compressed data remains within user-defined error bounds. This approach is particularly relevant for scientific data and can be adapted for neural network compression, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to enhance compression performance while maintaining error bounds.\n\n### Convergence Analysis Methods\n- Convergence guarantees for dynamic compression require careful analysis of the training process. The vanishing gradient problem, common in deep neural networks, can be mitigated using techniques like LSTM networks, gradient clipping, and batch normalization. These methods ensure that the gradients do not vanish or explode, thereby stabilizing the training process.\n- Theoretical foundations for compression, such as those provided by White-Box Transformers, link compression to information theory and provide a framework for analyzing the convergence of compressed models.\n\n### Stability Proofs for Dynamic Compression\n- Dynamic compression stability depends on careful error bound analysis and monitoring of the compression rate. The LoCoCo approach, which uses a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, demonstrates successful integration and stability in dynamic compression scenarios[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Case Studies\n\n### Real-World Implementations\n- Case studies like VCT (Video Compression Transformer) show how transformers can be integrated with compression techniques to simplify neural video compression. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating compression within existing architectures[Analysis Note].\n- The FlashAttention algorithm provides an example of how IO-aware exact attention can be implemented efficiently, highlighting the importance of hardware considerations in real-world implementations[Analysis Note].\n\n### Performance Comparisons\n- Comparing different compression techniques, such as those discussed in the context of model distillation, helps in identifying the optimal balance between model size and performance. Iterative testing of different compression thresholds is recommended to find the best approach for a specific application.\n- The integration of compression in transformers, as seen in VCT, shows significant performance improvements and stability in dynamic compression scenarios[Analysis Note].\n\n### Integration Challenges and Solutions\n- Modular design and compatibility with various frameworks are crucial for easy integration. The LoCoCo and VCT studies highlight the importance of modular design and the challenges of integrating compression techniques into existing architectures[Analysis Note].\n- Addressing hardware-specific challenges, such as memory access patterns and IO complexity, is essential for efficient implementation. Custom CUDA kernels and IO-aware algorithms can optimize performance in these contexts[Analysis Note].\n\n## Performance Benchmarking\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and compression ratios are essential for benchmarking compressed models. The rate-distortion function provides a framework for evaluating the efficiency of compression algorithms by balancing the rate of information transmission and allowable distortion.\n- Performance metrics should also include measures of training stability and convergence, such as gradient norms and loss functions, to ensure that the compressed model maintains its performance over time.\n\n### Comparison Methodologies\n- Comparing different compression algorithms involves evaluating their performance under various conditions, such as different data distributions and hardware configurations. The use of statistical tests, like those described in the context of generalization limits, can help identify the best performing algorithms.\n- Benchmarking should include both software and hardware-specific metrics to ensure that the compressed models are efficient in both training and inference phases[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hardware-Specific Benchmarks\n- Hardware-specific optimization is critical for efficient implementation. IO-aware algorithms, custom CUDA kernels, and careful consideration of memory hierarchy are essential for optimizing performance on specific hardware[Analysis Note].\n- Benchmarks should include metrics such as memory access patterns, IO complexity, and computational efficiency to ensure that the compressed models are optimized for the target hardware[Analysis Note].\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only highly performant but also efficient, stable, and scalable. The integration of compression techniques, careful error bound analysis, and hardware-specific optimization will be key to achieving these goals.\n",

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/18 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\n4171-4186, 2019.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We propose the low-rank transformer (LRT), a memory-efficient and fast neural architecture that significantly reduces the parameters and boosts the speed of training and inference for end-to-end speech recognition. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of the network by more than 50% and speeds up the inference time by around 1.35x compared to the baseline transformer model. The experiments show that our LRT model generalizes better and yields lower error rates on both validation and test sets compared to an uncompressed transformer model. The LRT model outperforms those from existing works on several datasets in an end-to-end setting without using an external language model or acoustic data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2019, pp. 7095-7099.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

Adaptive Rank Selections for Low-Rank Approximation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive low rank approximation language models\"*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Ting Hua, Yen-Chang Hsu, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework that achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants and retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Abstract:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or its weighted variants has significantly progressed in compressing language models. Previous works assume the same importance for all operations and assign the same number of ranks for different layers in a language model. However, such a uniform rank selection is sub-optimal since different operations (layers) have non-uniform demand in capacity. In other words, a desired SVD strategy should allocate more ranks for important operations and vice versa. However, a globally-optimized selection of ranks for neural networks is still an open problem, and this is a non-trivial challenge since the selection is discrete. In this work, we propose a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework. Our strategy uses a novel regularization to enable the masking to comply with the SVD property where the ranks have sorted singular values. The experiments examined both types of language models, encoder-only and decoder-only models, including large language models like LLaMA. Our compressed model achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants. More interestingly, our method retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

To reduce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation prevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation tasks. We show that it significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, is proposed, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6419  (*Influential: 1125*)\n\n#### 4. Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Zhiwei Deng, Olga Russakovsky*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

We propose a new method of compressing this multidimensional weather and climate data: a coordinate-based neural network is trained to overfit the data, and the resulting parameters are taken as a compact representation of the original grid-based data. While compression ratios range from 300x to more than 3,000x, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art compressor SZ3 in terms of weighted RMSE, MAE. It can faithfully preserve important large scale atmosphere structures and does not introduce artifacts. When using the resulting neural network as a 790x compressed dataloader to train the WeatherBench forecasting model, its RMSE increases by less than 2%.

Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient SVD implementation\"*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient SVD implementation\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. SARA: Singular-Value Based Adaptive Low-Rank Adaption\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive low rank approximation language models\"*\n\n*Jihao Gu, Shuai Chen, Zelin Wang, Yibo Zhang, Ping Gong*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing number of parameters in large pre-trained models, LoRA as\na parameter-efficient fine-tuning(PEFT) method is widely used for not adding\ninference overhead. The LoRA method assumes that weight changes during\nfine-tuning can be approximated by low-rank matrices. However, the rank values\nneed to be manually verified to match different downstream tasks, and they\ncannot accommodate the varying importance of different layers in the model. In\nthis work, we first analyze the relationship between the performance of\ndifferent layers and their ranks using SVD. Based on this, we design the\nSingular-Value Based Adaptive Low-Rank Adaption(SARA), which adaptively finds\nthe rank during initialization by performing SVD on the pre-trained weights.\nAdditionally, we explore the Mixture-of-SARA(Mo-SARA), which significantly\nreduces the number of parameters by fine-tuning only multiple parallel sets of\nsingular values controlled by a router. Extensive experiments on various\ncomplex tasks demonstrate the simplicity and parameter efficiency of our\nmethods. They can effectively and adaptively find the most suitable rank for\neach layer of each model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-06T16:39:42Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-06T16:39:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. NEAT: Nonlinear Parameter-efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive low rank approximation language models\"*\n\n*Yibo Zhong, Haoxiang Jiang, Lincan Li, Ryumei Nakada, Tianci Liu, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Haoyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained models is crucial for adapting large models to\ndownstream tasks, often delivering state-of-the-art performance. However,\nfine-tuning all model parameters is resource-intensive and laborious, leading\nto the emergence of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. One widely\nadopted PEFT technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), freezes the pre-trained\nmodel weights and introduces two low-rank matrices whose ranks are\nsignificantly smaller than the dimensions of the original weight matrices. This\nenables efficient fine-tuning by adjusting only a small number of parameters.\nDespite its efficiency, LoRA approximates weight updates using low-rank\ndecomposition, which struggles to capture complex, non-linear components and\nefficient optimization trajectories. As a result, LoRA-based methods often\nexhibit a significant performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. Closing\nthis gap requires higher ranks, which increases the number of parameters. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a nonlinear parameter-efficient\nadaptation method (NEAT). NEAT introduces a lightweight neural network that\ntakes pre-trained weights as input and learns a nonlinear transformation to\napproximate cumulative weight updates. These updates can be interpreted as\nfunctions of the corresponding pre-trained weights. The nonlinear approximation\ndirectly models the cumulative updates, effectively capturing complex and\nnon-linear structures in the weight updates. Our theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates taht NEAT can be more efficient than LoRA while having equal or\ngreater expressivity. Extensive evaluations across four benchmarks and over\ntwenty datasets demonstrate that NEAT significantly outperforms baselines in\nboth vision and text tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-02T17:29:23Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-02T17:29:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we\npresent a neural model for single-document summarization based on joint\nextraction and syntactic compression. Our model chooses sentences from the\ndocument, identifies possible compressions based on constituency parses, and\nscores those compressions with a neural model to produce the final summary. For\nlearning, we construct oracle extractive-compressive summaries, then learn both\nof our components jointly with this supervision. Experimental results on the\nCNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets show that our model achieves strong\nperformance (comparable to state-of-the-art systems) as evaluated by ROUGE.\nMoreover, our approach outperforms an off-the-shelf compression module, and\nhuman and manual evaluation shows that our model's output generally remains\ngrammatical.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-03T08:19:42Z  (*Updated: 2019-09-09T19:43:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers\n  for Flexible Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained Transformer models like T5 and BART have advanced the state of\nthe art on a wide range of text generation tasks. Compressing these models into\nsmaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural\nnetwork compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization\nare limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this\npaper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder\nframework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular\nTransformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or\nmore consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and\nknowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly\nassembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different\nperformance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a\nsingle training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular\nTransformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with\nlittle to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. SORSA: Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors\n  Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient SVD implementation\"*\n\n*Yang Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) comes with a\nsignificant increase in their parameter size, presenting challenges for\nadaptation and fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are\nwidely used to adapt LLMs for downstream tasks efficiently. In this paper, we\npropose Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors\nAdaptation, or SORSA, a novel PEFT method. We introduce a method to analyze the\nvariation of the parameters by performing singular value decomposition (SVD)\nand discuss and analyze SORSA's superiority in minimizing the alteration in the\nSVD aspect. Each SORSA adapter consists of two main parts: trainable principal\nsingular weights $W_p = U_p \\text{diag}(S_p) V^\\top_p$, and frozen residual\nweights $W_r = U_r \\text{diag}(S_r) V^\\top_r$. These parts are initialized by\nperforming SVD on pre-trained weights. Moreover, we implement and analyze an\northonormal regularizer, which we prove could decrease the condition number of\n$W_p$ and allows the optimization to be more efficient. SORSA adapters could be\nmerged during inference, thus eliminating any inference latency. After all,\nSORSA shows a faster convergence than PiSSA and LoRA in our experiments. On the\nGSM-8K benchmark, Llama 2 7B adapted using SORSA achieved 56.03% accuracy,\nsurpassing LoRA (42.30%), Full FT (49.05%), and PiSSA (53.07%). On the MATH\nbenchmark, SORSA achieved 10.36% accuracy, outperforming LoRA (5.50%), Full FT\n(7.22%), and PiSSA (7.44%). We conclude that SORSA offers a new perspective on\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating remarkable performance.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient SVD implementation\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

A partial multi-scale feature aggregation (PMFA) approach is proposed based on a subset of Whisper encoder blocks to derive highly discriminative speaker embeddings.Experimental results demonstrate that using the middle to later blocks of the Whisper encoder keeps more speaker information. On the VoxCeleb1 and CN-Celeb1 datasets, our system achieves 1.42% and 8.23% equal error rates (EERs) respectively, receiving 0.58% and 1.81% absolute EER reductions over the ECAPA-TDNN baseline, and 0.46% and 0.97% over the ResNet34 baseline. Furthermore, our results indicate that using Whisper models trained on multilingual data can effectively enhance the model's robustness across languages. Finally, the low-rank adaptation approach is evaluated, which reduces the trainable model parameters by approximately 45 times while only slightly increasing EER by 0.2%.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-28\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We present a new PEFT method called Robust Adaptation (RoSA) inspired by robust principal component analysis that jointly trains $\\textit{low-rank}$ and $\\textit{highly-sparse}$ components on top of a set of fixed pretrained weights to efficiently approximate the performance of a full-fine-tuning (FFT) solution. Across a series of challenging generative tasks such as grade-school math and SQL query generation, which require fine-tuning for good performance, we show that RoSA outperforms LoRA, pure sparse fine-tuning, and alternative hybrid methods at the same parameter budget, and can even recover the performance of FFT on some tasks. We provide system support for RoSA to complement the training algorithm, specifically in the form of sparse GPU kernels which enable memory- and computationally-efficient training, and show that it is also compatible with low-precision base weights, resulting in the first joint representation combining quantization, low-rank and sparse approximations.

Dataset Meta-Learning from Kernel Ridge-Regression\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state compression neural networks\"*\n\n*Zhourong Chen, Jaehoon Lee, Timothy Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the most fundamental aspects of any machine learning algorithm is the training data used by the algorithm. We introduce the novel concept of $\\epsilon$-approximation of datasets, obtaining datasets which are much smaller than or are significant corruptions of the original training data while maintaining similar model performance. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm called Kernel Inducing Points (KIP) for obtaining such remarkable datasets, inspired by the recent developments in the correspondence between infinitely-wide neural networks and kernel ridge-regression (KRR). For KRR tasks, we demonstrate that KIP can compress datasets by one or two orders of magnitude, significantly improving previous dataset distillation and subset selection methods while obtaining state of the art results for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification. Furthermore, our KIP-learned datasets are transferable to the training of finite-width neural networks even beyond the lazy-training regime, which leads to state of the art results for neural network dataset distillation with potential applications to privacy-preservation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-30\n\n\n\n#### 4.

This approach, known as LoRA-A2, incorporates alternating freeze and adaptive rank selection strategies to handle high data heterogeneity and low ranks efficiently. This dynamic rank selection helps in maintaining performance while reducing the number of communicated parameters.\n- **Adaptive Rank Selection for Low-Rank Approximation**: The repository in implements adaptive rank selection using learnable neural networks to predict optimal decomposition ranks. This method is crucial for dynamically adjusting the rank based on the specific needs of the model.\n\n### Energy Threshold-Based Compression\n- While the sources do not explicitly mention \"energy threshold-based compression,\" the adaptive rank selection methods like LoRA-A2 and the adaptive rank selection repository imply a dynamic adjustment of ranks, which can be seen as analogous to energy threshold-based approaches. These methods adjust the rank based on the importance and impact of the parameters, which can be related to energy thresholds in terms of computational resource allocation.\n\n### SVD Optimization for Neural Networks\n- **Low-Rank Kronecker Product (LoKr)**: This method, described in, uses the Kronecker product of two low-rank matrices to update the weight matrix. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture complex interactions without significantly increasing the parameter budget, which is beneficial for SVD optimization.\n- **LoLCATs**: The Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs) method in involves training linear attentions to match softmax attentions and then adjusting for approximation errors using low-rank adaptation. This method significantly improves linearizing quality and training efficiency, which can be seen as an optimization of SVD for neural networks.\n\n## State Compression in Language Models\n\n### Selective Retention Mechanisms\n- **Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA)**: This method, mentioned in, uses an importance sampling strategy to selectively activate different layers during optimization. This approach ensures that only critical layers are updated, which is a form of selective retention mechanism.\n- **Gating for State Compression**: The concept of gating is implicit in methods like LISA, where certain layers are selectively updated. However, for explicit gating mechanisms, the \"Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\" (though not directly referenced here) could be a relevant area of study, as it introduces selective activation mechanisms that can be adapted for state compression.\n\n### Memory-Efficient State Representations\n- **LoRA**: The Low-Rank Adaptation technique introduces low-rank matrices that significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, leading to memory-efficient state representations. This method ensures that the original model weights remain unchanged, allowing for easy integration of new fine-tune weights.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### IO-Aware SVD Computation\n- **LoLCATs**: This method in improves linearizing quality and training efficiency with orders of magnitude less memory and compute. While it does not explicitly discuss IO-aware SVD computation, the efficiency gains suggest optimized memory and compute usage, which can be aligned with IO-aware optimizations.\n\n### Parallel Processing for Matrix Operations\n- **General Considerations**: Efficient SVD implementations often involve parallel processing to speed up matrix operations. The LoKr method and LoLCATs imply the use of efficient matrix operations, which can be optimized for parallel processing on modern hardware.\n\n### Memory Access Optimization for Compression\n- **FlashAttention**: Although not directly referenced in the provided sources, \"FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\" (mentioned in the initial analysis) is relevant for understanding IO-aware algorithms and memory access optimization. These principles can be applied to optimize memory access patterns and cache utilization in the context of SVD and low-rank approximations.\n\nIn summary, the techniques such as LoRA, LoLCATs, and adaptive rank selection methods provide a robust framework for improving autoregressive language models through adaptive low-rank approximation, selective state compression, and hardware-efficient implementations. These methods address the key aspects of dynamic rank selection, energy threshold-based compression, SVD optimization, selective retention mechanisms, and hardware efficiency, aligning well with the researcher's goals.\n",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/18 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n4171-4186, 2019.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Operator SVD with Neural Networks via Nested Low-Rank Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: \"SVD optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*J. J. Ryu, Xiangxiang Xu, H. Erol, Yuheng Bu, Lizhong Zheng, G. Wornell*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition is proposed, accompanied by new techniques called nesting for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order.\n\n**Abstract:** Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or finding its leading eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many machine learning and scientific computing problems. For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques. This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new techniques called \\emph{nesting} for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order. The proposed method promotes the desired orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for use cases in computational physics and machine learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

A line of work has studied the NTK spectrum for two-layer and deep networks with at least a layer with $\\Omega(N)$ neurons, $N$ being the number of training samples. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence suggesting that deep networks with sub-linear layer widths are powerful memorizers and optimizers, as long as the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples. Thus, a natural open question is whether the NTK is well conditioned in such a challenging sub-linear setup. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our key technical contribution is a lower bound on the smallest NTK eigenvalue for deep networks with the minimum possible over-parameterization: the number of parameters is roughly $\\Omega(N)$ and, hence, the number of neurons is as little as $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$. To showcase the applicability of our NTK bounds, we provide two results concerning memorization capacity and optimization guarantees for gradient descent training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3.

We find the spectra of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix in deep learning (DL) training tasks are concentrated on a small leading eigenspace that changes throughout training, motivating a low-rank sketching approach. We describe a generic method for reducing memory and compute requirements of maintaining a matrix preconditioner using the Frequent Directions (FD) sketch. While previous approaches have explored applying FD for second-order optimization, we present a novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank $k$: in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting over dimension $d$, we match full-matrix $d^2$ memory regret using only $dk$ memory up to additive error in the bottom $d-k$ eigenvalues of the gradient covariance. Further, we show extensions of our work to Shampoo, resulting in a method competitive in quality with Shampoo and Adam, yet requiring only sub-linear memory for tracking second moments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

These methods maintain second-order statistics of each parameter, thus doubling the memory footprint of the optimizer. In behemoth-size applications, this memory overhead restricts the size of the model being used as well as the number of examples in a mini-batch.

CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient adaptive compression\"*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

S. Nacson, Elad Hoffer, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines asynchronous training from the perspective of dynamical stability and finds that the degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of minima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Background: Recent developments have made it possible to accelerate neural networks training significantly using large batch sizes and data parallelism. Training in an asynchronous fashion, where delay occurs, can make training even more scalable. However, asynchronous training has its pitfalls, mainly a degradation in generalization, even after convergence of the algorithm. This gap remains not well understood, as theoretical analysis so far mainly focused on the convergence rate of asynchronous methods. Contributions: We examine asynchronous training from the perspective of dynamical stability. We find that the degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of minima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We derive closed-form rules on how the learning rate could be changed, while keeping the accessible set the same. Specifically, for high delay values, we find that the learning rate should be kept inversely proportional to the delay. We then extend this analysis to include momentum. We find momentum should be either turned off, or modified to improve training stability. We provide empirical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. LoraRetriever: Input-Aware LoRA Retrieval and Composition for Mixed Tasks in the Wild\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic rank selection stability\"*\n\n*Ziyu Zhao, Leilei Gan, Guoyin Wang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Hongxia Yang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** LoraRetriever is proposed, a retrieve-then-compose framework that adaptively retrieves and composes multiple LoRAs according to the input prompts, highlighting its practical effectiveness and versatility.\n\n**Abstract:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides an effective yet efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). The modular and plug-and-play nature of LoRA enables the integration of diverse domain-specific LoRAs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research on exploiting multiple LoRAs either focuses on specific isolated downstream tasks or fixes the selection of LoRAs during training. However, in real-world scenarios, LLMs receive diverse prompts covering different tasks, and the pool of candidate LoRAs is often dynamically updated. To bridge this gap, we propose LoraRetriever, a retrieve-then-compose framework that adaptively retrieves and composes multiple LoRAs according to the input prompts. LoraRetriever contains three main components: firstly, identifying and retrieving LoRAs relevant to the given input; secondly, formulating strategies for effectively integrating the retrieved LoRAs; and thirdly, developing efficient batch inference to accommodate heterogeneous requests. Experimental results indicate that LoraRetriever consistently outperforms the baselines, highlighting its practical effectiveness and versatility.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

However,\nstandard SVD treats the parameters within the matrix with equal importance,\nwhich is a simple but unrealistic assumption. The parameters of a trained\nneural network model may affect task performance unevenly, which suggests\nnon-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition\nmethod aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real\ncases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex\noptimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically\ninvestigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and\nexamined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models.

Online Adaptation of Language Models with a Memory of Amortized Contexts\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient adaptive compression\"*\n\n*Jihoon Tack, Jaehyung Kim, Eric Mitchell, Jinwoo Shin, Yee Whye Teh, Jonathan Richard Schwarz*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the rapid generation and dissemination of information, large language\nmodels (LLMs) quickly run out of date despite enormous development costs. Due\nto this crucial need to keep models updated, online learning has emerged as a\ncritical necessity when utilizing LLMs for real-world applications. However,\ngiven the ever-expanding corpus of unseen documents and the large parameter\nspace of modern LLMs, efficient adaptation is essential. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Memory of Amortized Contexts (MAC), an efficient and\neffective online adaptation framework for LLMs with strong knowledge retention.\nWe propose an amortized feature extraction and memory-augmentation approach to\ncompress and extract information from new documents into compact modulations\nstored in a memory bank. When answering questions, our model attends to and\nextracts relevant knowledge from this memory bank. To learn informative\nmodulations in an efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based\nmeta-learning, which substitutes the optimization process with a single forward\npass of the encoder. Subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate\nselected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question,\nallowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring\nfurther gradient updates.

Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our\napproach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Rank Stabilization Scaling Factor for Fine-Tuning with LoRA\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic rank selection stability\"*\n\n*Damjan Kalajdzievski*\n\n**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly compute and memory\nintensive, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are now a common\nstrategy to fine-tune LLMs. A popular PEFT method is Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA),\nwhich adds trainable low-rank \"adapters\" to selected layers. Each adapter\nconsists of a low-rank matrix product, multiplicatively scaled by a\nrank-dependent factor. This scaling factor, which divides adapters by a factor\nof the rank, results in slowed learning and stunted performance for LoRA with\nhigher-rank adapters. Consequently, the use of LoRA in practice has generally\nbeen limited to very low ranks. In this work, we study the impact of the\nscaling factor on the learning process and prove that LoRA adapters should be\ndivided by a factor of the square root of the rank. Modifying LoRA with the\nappropriate scaling factor, which we call the rank-stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA)\nmethod, easily provides for a fine-tuning compute/performance trade-off, where\nlarger ranks can be used to trade off increased computational resources during\ntraining for better fine-tuning performance, with no change in inference\ncomputing cost.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-28T03:23:20Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-28T03:23:20Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Data Efficient Evaluation of Large Language Models and Text-to-Image\n  Models via Adaptive Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic rank selection stability\"*\n\n*Cong Xu, Gayathri Saranathan, Mahammad Parwez Alam, Arpit Shah, James Lim, Soon Yee Wong, Foltin Martin, Suparna Bhattacharya*\n\n**Abstract:** Evaluating LLMs and text-to-image models is a computationally intensive task\noften overlooked. Efficient evaluation is crucial for understanding the diverse\ncapabilities of these models and enabling comparisons across a growing number\nof new models and benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SubLIME, a\ndata-efficient evaluation framework that employs adaptive sampling techniques,\nsuch as clustering and quality-based methods, to create representative subsets\nof benchmarks. Our approach ensures statistically aligned model rankings\ncompared to full datasets, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients.\nEmpirical analysis across six NLP benchmarks reveals that: (1) quality-based\nsampling consistently achieves strong correlations (0.85 to 0.95) with full\ndatasets at a 10\\% sampling rate such as Quality SE and Quality CPD (2)\nclustering methods excel in specific benchmarks such as MMLU (3) no single\nmethod universally outperforms others across all metrics. Extending this\nframework, we leverage the HEIM leaderboard to cover 25 text-to-image models on\n17 different benchmarks. SubLIME dynamically selects the optimal technique for\neach benchmark, significantly reducing evaluation costs while preserving\nranking integrity and score distribution. Notably, a minimal sampling rate of\n1% proves effective for benchmarks like MMLU. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nemploying difficulty-based sampling to target more challenging benchmark\nsegments enhances model differentiation with broader score distributions. We\nalso combine semantic search, tool use, and GPT-4 review to identify redundancy\nacross benchmarks within specific LLM categories, such as coding benchmarks.\nThis allows us to further reduce the number of samples needed to maintain\ntargeted rank preservation. Overall, SubLIME offers a versatile and\ncost-effective solution for the robust evaluation of LLMs and text-to-image\nmodels.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-21T07:38:55Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-21T07:38:55Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. An Analysis of SVD for Deep Rotation Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: \"SVD optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Noah Snavely, Jake Levinson, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Angjoo Kanazawa, Ameesh Makadia, Kefan Chen, Carlos Esteves*\n\n**Abstract:** Symmetric orthogonalization via SVD, and closely related procedures, are well-known techniques for projecting matrices onto $O(n)$ or $SO(n)$. These tools have long been used for applications in computer vision, for example optimal 3D alignment problems solved by orthogonal Procrustes, rotation averaging, or Essential matrix decomposition. Despite its utility in different settings, SVD orthogonalization as a procedure for producing rotation matrices is typically overlooked in deep learning models, where the preferences tend toward classic representations like unit quaternions, Euler angles, and axis-angle, or more recently-introduced methods. Despite the importance of 3D rotations in computer vision and robotics, a single universally effective representation is still missing. Here, we explore the viability of SVD orthogonalization for 3D rotations in neural networks. We present a theoretical analysis that shows SVD is the natural choice for projecting onto the rotation group. Our extensive quantitative analysis shows simply replacing existing representations with the SVD orthogonalization procedure obtains state of the art performance in many deep learning applications covering both supervised and unsupervised training.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. Compressible-composable NeRF via Rank-residual Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: \"SVD optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Gang Zeng, Jingbo Wang, Xiaokang Chen, Jiaxiang Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling method to represent 3D objects and scenes for photo-realistic rendering. However, its implicit representation causes difficulty in manipulating the models like the explicit mesh representation. Several recent advances in NeRF manipulation are usually restricted by a shared renderer network, or suffer from large model size. To circumvent the hurdle, in this paper, we present an explicit neural field representation that enables efficient and convenient manipulation of models. To achieve this goal, we learn a hybrid tensor rank decomposition of the scene without neural networks. Motivated by the low-rank approximation property of the SVD algorithm, we propose a rank-residual learning strategy to encourage the preservation of primary information in lower ranks. The model size can then be dynamically adjusted by rank truncation to control the levels of detail, achieving near-optimal compression without extra optimization. Furthermore, different models can be arbitrarily transformed and composed into one scene by concatenating along the rank dimension. The growth of storage cost can also be mitigated by compressing the unimportant objects in the composed scene. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods, while enabling extra capability of compression and composition.

ContextNet: Exploring Context and Detail for Semantic Segmentation in Real-time\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient adaptive compression\"*\n\n*Rudra P. K. Poudel, Christopher Zach, Ujwal Bonde, Stephan Liwicki*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep learning architectures produce highly accurate results on many\nchallenging semantic segmentation datasets. State-of-the-art methods are,\nhowever, not directly transferable to real-time applications or embedded\ndevices, since naive adaptation of such systems to reduce computational cost\n(speed, memory and energy) causes a significant drop in accuracy. We propose\nContextNet, a new deep neural network architecture which builds on factorized\nconvolution, network compression and pyramid representation to produce\ncompetitive semantic segmentation in real-time with low memory requirement.\nContextNet combines a deep network branch at low resolution that captures\nglobal context information efficiently with a shallow branch that focuses on\nhigh-resolution segmentation details. We analyse our network in a thorough\nablation study and present results on the Cityscapes dataset, achieving 66.1%\naccuracy at 18.3 frames per second at full (1024x2048) resolution (41.9 fps\nwith pipelined computations for streamed data).\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient adaptive compression\"*\n\n*Xiao Chen, Lifeng Shang, Zhiqi Huang, Qun Liu, Lu Hou, Xin Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computation and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually compress the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size. They can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can flexibly adjust the size and latency by selecting adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allowing both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT-base (or RoBERTa-base), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.

This approach is particularly useful for compressing language models while retaining high accuracy, even with limited fine-tuning.\n- The paper on \"A Power Method for Computing Singular Value Decomposition\" proposes an optimization-based approach using a gradient search algorithm, which can be efficient for computing SVD, especially for high-dimensional data. This method formalizes SVD computation as an optimization problem, making it suitable for neural network applications.\n\n### Stability Analysis of Dynamic SVD\n- The stability of dynamic SVD can be analyzed through the convergence properties of the optimization algorithms used. For instance, the power method proposed in the arXiv paper ensures convergence based on the behavior of the singular values and the precision required. Faster convergence is observed when the singular values decay quickly.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient SVD Implementations\n- The work on \"Adaptive Rank Selections\" also touches on the hardware efficiency of their method, highlighting that their compressed model retains better accuracy with minimal fine-tuning, which is beneficial for hardware-efficient implementations.\n- The reference to \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" by Yang et al. suggests that hardware-efficient training methods can be integrated with SVD optimization techniques to enhance overall efficiency.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Compression\n\n### Adaptive Compression Techniques\n- The \"Adaptive Rank Selections\" paper by Gao et al. is highly relevant here, as it introduces an adaptive rank selection mechanism that allocates more ranks to important operations and fewer ranks to less important ones, leading to more efficient compression.\n- The \"SARA\" paper by Gu et al. also discusses adaptive low-rank adaptation using SVD, which can be integrated into compression strategies to dynamically adjust the rank based on the pre-trained weights.\n\n### Memory-Compute Trade-offs\n- The analysis note from the AdaptiveSparseStateCompressor proposal highlights the need for careful consideration of memory-compute trade-offs. The work by Yang et al. on \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" provides insights into trading off memory movement against parallelizability, which is crucial for balancing memory and compute resources.\n\n### Integration with Gating Mechanisms\n- The integration of adaptive rank selection with gating mechanisms is an area that needs further study. However, the \"DenseMamba\" paper by He et al. provides a framework for selectively integrating hidden states, which can be adapted to include gating mechanisms for more efficient state compression.\n\n## Dynamic Rank Selection\n\n### Stability Analysis Methods\n- The stability of dynamic rank selection can be analyzed through the convergence guarantees of the optimization algorithms. The power method for SVD computation ensures convergence based on the singular values' decay, which is a key factor in stability analysis.\n\n### Convergence Guarantees\n- The convergence analysis in the \"A Power Method for Computing Singular Value Decomposition\" paper shows that the algorithm converges based on the convex property of the objective function, with the rate of convergence depending on the singular values' behavior.\n\n### Performance Impact Studies\n- The \"Adaptive Rank Selections\" paper demonstrates that their method retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, indicating a positive performance impact. This suggests that dynamic rank selection can lead to more efficient and accurate models.\n\nIn summary, the works by Gao et al., Gu et al., and the analysis on power methods for SVD provide substantial insights into optimizing SVD for neural networks, achieving memory-efficient compression, and ensuring the stability and performance of dynamic rank selection. These techniques can be integrated to improve the design of autoregressive language models, enhancing their efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 35/68 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2208.05577, aug 2022.

Communication-Efficient Adaptive Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient adaptive compression implementation\"*\n\n*Yujia Wang, Lu Lin, Jinghui Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient adaptive federated learning method (FedCAMS) with theoretical convergence guarantees and shows that in the nonconvex stochastic optimization setting, the proposed FedCAMS achieves the same convergence rate of O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TKm}})$ as its non-compressed counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning is a machine learning training paradigm that enables clients to jointly train models without sharing their own localized data. However, the implementation of federated learning in practice still faces numerous challenges, such as the large communication overhead due to the repetitive server-client synchronization and the lack of adaptivity by SGD-based model updates. Despite that various methods have been proposed for reducing the communication cost by gradient compression or quantization, and the federated versions of adaptive optimizers such as FedAdam are proposed to add more adaptivity, the current federated learning framework still cannot solve the aforementioned challenges all at once. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient adaptive federated learning method (FedCAMS) with theoretical convergence guarantees. We show that in the nonconvex stochastic optimization setting, our proposed FedCAMS achieves the same convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TKm}})$ as its non-compressed counterparts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks verify our theoretical analysis.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 2. Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient adaptive compression implementation\"*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

AdaTune: Adaptive Tensor Program Compilation Made Efficient\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient adaptive compression implementation\"*\n\n*Menghao Li, Minjia Zhang, Chi Wang, Mingqin Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new method is presented, called AdaTune, that significantly reduces the optimization time of tensor programs for high-performance deep learning inference and devise a surrogate model with uncertainty quantification that allows the optimization to adapt to hardware and model heterogeneity better.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models are computationally intense, and implementations often have to be highly optimized by experts or hardware vendors to be usable in practice. The DL compiler, together with Learning-to-Compile has proven to be a powerful technique for optimizing tensor programs. However, a limitation of this approach is that it still suffers from unbearably long overall optimization time. In this paper, we present a new method, called AdaTune, that significantly reduces the optimization time of tensor programs for high-performance deep learning inference. In particular, we propose an adaptive evaluation method that statistically early terminates a costly hardware measurement without losing much accuracy. We further devise a surrogate model with uncertainty quantification that allows the optimization to adapt to hardware and model heterogeneity better. Finally, we introduce a contextual optimizer that provides adaptive control of the exploration and exploitation to improve the transformation space searching effectiveness. We evaluate and compare the levels of optimization obtained by AutoTVM, a state-of-the-art Learning-to-Compile technique on top of TVM, and AdaTune. The experiment results show that AdaTune obtains up to 115% higher GFLOPS than the baseline under the same optimization time budget. Furthermore, AdaTune provides 1.3\u20133.9\\(\\times\\) speedup in optimization time over the baseline to reach the same optimization quality for a range of models across different hardware architectures.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 121  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. Task-aware Distributed Source Coding under Dynamic Bandwidth\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Po-han Li, S. Ankireddy, Ruihan Zhao, Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub, Ehsan Moradi-Pari, U. Topcu, Sandeep P. Chinchali, Hyeji Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead and improving the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient compression of correlated data is essential to minimize communication overload in multi-sensor networks. In such networks, each sensor independently compresses the data and transmits them to a central node due to limited communication bandwidth. A decoder at the central node decompresses and passes the data to a pre-trained machine learning-based task to generate the final output. Thus, it is important to compress the features that are relevant to the task. Additionally, the final performance depends heavily on the total available bandwidth. In practice, it is common to encounter varying availability in bandwidth, and higher bandwidth results in better performance of the task. We design a novel distributed compression framework composed of independent encoders and a joint decoder, which we call neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA). NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead. NDPCA achieves this by learning low-rank task representations and efficiently distributing bandwidth among sensors, thus providing a graceful trade-off between performance and bandwidth. Experiments show that NDPCA improves the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation by 9% and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery by 14% compared to an autoencoder with uniform bandwidth allocation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Safety Guarantees for Neural Network Dynamic Systems via Stochastic Barrier Functions\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Rayan Mazouz, Karan Muvvala, Akash Ratheesh, L. Laurenti, Morteza Lahijanian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A method of providing safety guarantees for NNDMs is introduced based on stochastic barrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov functions with stability, and the convexity property of the barrier function is exploited to formulate the optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Networks (NNs) have been successfully employed to represent the state evolution of complex dynamical systems. Such models, referred to as NN dynamic models (NNDMs), use iterative noisy predictions of NN to estimate a distribution of system trajectories over time. Despite their accuracy, safety analysis of NNDMs is known to be a challenging problem and remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a method of providing safety guarantees for NNDMs. Our approach is based on stochastic barrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov functions with stability. We first show a method of synthesizing stochastic barrier functions for NNDMs via a convex optimization problem, which in turn provides a lower bound on the system's safety probability. A key step in our method is the employment of the recent convex approximation results for NNs to find piece-wise linear bounds, which allow the formulation of the barrier function synthesis problem as a sum-of-squares optimization program. If the obtained safety probability is above the desired threshold, the system is certified. Otherwise, we introduce a method of generating controls for the system that robustly maximizes the safety probability in a minimally-invasive manner. We exploit the convexity property of the barrier function to formulate the optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the method. Namely, they show that the method can scale to multi-dimensional NNDMs with multiple layers and hundreds of neurons per layer, and that the controller can significantly improve the safety probability.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

Agustsson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression by independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past.\n\n**Abstract:** We show how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression. Previous methods have been relying on an increasing number of architectural biases and priors, including motion prediction and warping operations, resulting in complex models. Instead, we independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past. The resulting video compression transformer outperforms previous methods on standard video compression data sets. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model learns to handle complex motion patterns such as panning, blurring and fading purely from data. Our approach is easy to implement, and we release code to facilitate future research.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 77  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 8. LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"architecture integration patterns compression\"*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward\"drop-in\"integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9.

DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient adaptive compression implementation\"*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Xiao Chen, Qun Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT, though powerful in many natural\nlanguage processing tasks, are both computation and memory expensive. To\nalleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks\nbefore deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually compress\nthe large BERT model to a fixed smaller size. They can not fully satisfy the\nrequirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT),\nwhich can flexibly adjust the size and latency by selecting adaptive width and\ndepth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a\nwidth-adaptive BERT and then allowing both adaptive width and depth, by\ndistilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network\nrewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons\nshared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency\nconstraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its\nlargest size has comparable performance as BERT-base (or RoBERTa-base), while\nat smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression\nmethods.

Hardware-Aware Parallel Prompt Decoding for Memory-Efficient\n  Acceleration of LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient adaptive compression implementation\"*\n\n*Hao Mark Chen, Wayne Luk, Ka Fai Cedric Yiu, Rui Li, Konstantin Mishchenko, Stylianos I. Venieris, Hongxiang Fan*\n\n**Abstract:** The auto-regressive decoding of Large Language Models (LLMs) results in\nsignificant overheads in their hardware performance. While recent research has\ninvestigated various speculative decoding techniques for multi-token\ngeneration, these efforts have primarily focused on improving processing speed\nsuch as throughput. Crucially, they often neglect other metrics essential for\nreal-life deployments, such as memory consumption and training cost. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that\nrequires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a\nsingle A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours. Inspired by the human natural language\ngeneration process, $PPD$ approximates outputs generated at future timesteps in\nparallel by using multiple prompt tokens. This approach partially recovers the\nmissing conditional dependency information necessary for multi-token\ngeneration, resulting in up to a 28% higher acceptance rate for long-range\npredictions. Furthermore, we present a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree\ntechnique that adaptively optimizes this decoding scheme to fully leverage the\ncomputational capacities on different GPUs. Through extensive experiments\nacross LLMs ranging from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B on a wide range of\nbenchmarks, our approach demonstrates up to 2.49$\\times$ speedup and maintains\na minimal runtime memory overhead of just $0.0004$%.

Balancing Cost and Benefit with Tied-Multi Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Raj Dabre, Raphael Rubino, Atsushi Fujita*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose and evaluate a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers\nwith tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the\ndynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the\nN-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last\ndecoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single\nloss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of\none of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a\nmodel subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers,\nand can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and\ndecoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of\nencoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent\nstacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present\na cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine\ntranslation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving\ntranslation quality.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-20T08:20:52Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-20T08:20:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Multi-Layer Softmaxing during Training Neural Machine Translation for\n  Flexible Decoding with Fewer Layers\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Raj Dabre, Atsushi Fujita*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel procedure for training an encoder-decoder based\ndeep neural network which compresses NxM models into a single model enabling us\nto dynamically choose the number of encoder and decoder layers for decoding.\nUsually, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the\nM-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute\nsoftmax loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM\nlosses: the softmax loss for the output of each of the M decoder layers derived\nusing the output of each of the N encoder layers. A single model trained by our\nmethod can be used for decoding with an arbitrary fewer number of encoder and\ndecoder layers. In practical scenarios, this (a) enables faster decoding with\ninsignificant losses in translation quality and (b) alleviates the need to\ntrain NxM models, thereby saving space. We take a case study of neural machine\ntranslation and show the advantage and give a cost-benefit analysis of our\napproach.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-27T10:17:24Z  (*Updated: 2019-08-28T09:11:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All\n  There Is?\n\n*From Search Query: \"architecture integration patterns compression\"*\n\n*Yaodong Yu, Sam Buchanan, Druv Pai, Tianzhe Chu, Ziyang Wu, Shengbang Tong, Hao Bai, Yuexiang Zhai, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Yi Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning\nis to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens,\ntowards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces.\nThe goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure,\ncalled sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic\ninformation gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From\nthis perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers,\ncan be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure.\nParticularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on\nparts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the\nrepresentation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the\ncoding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron\nsparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like\ndeep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully\ninterpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and\ncompression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be\nrealized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived\nwhite-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders.\nExperiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to\ncompress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text\ndatasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered\ntransformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the\nproposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the\ngap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of\ndata compression.

Here, we propose, \\texttt{phase2vec}, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of 2D dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. In an auxiliary training period, embeddings are optimized so that they robustly encode the equations of unseen data over and above the performance of a per-equation fitting method. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also, crucially, learns embeddings that respect the underlying semantics of the embedded physical systems. We validate the quality of learned embeddings investigating the extent to which physical categories of input data can be decoded from embeddings compared to standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We find that our embeddings encode important physical properties of the underlying data, including the stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows, with greater fidelity than competing methods. We finally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Convective heat transfer in the Burgers-Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard system\n\n*From Search Query: \"stability analysis dynamic compression\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The dynamics of heat transfer in a model system of Rayleigh-B\\'enard (RB) convection reduced to its essential, here dubbed Burgers-Rayleigh-B\\'enard (BRB), is studied. The system is spatially one-dimensional, the flow field is compressible and its evolution is described by the Burgers equation forced by an active temperature field. The BRB dynamics shares some remarkable similarities with realistic RB thermal convection in higher spatial dimensions: i) it has a supercritical pitchfork instability for the onset of convection which solely depends on the Rayleigh number $(Ra)$ and not on Prandlt $(Pr)$, occurring at the critical value $Ra_c = (2\\pi)^4$ ii) the convective regime is spatially organized in distinct boundary-layers and bulk regions, iii) the asymptotic high $Ra$ limit displays the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers scaling regime $Nu = \\sqrt{RaPr}/4$ for $Pr\\ll 1$, $Nu=\\sqrt{Ra}/(4\\sqrt{\\pi})$ for $Pr\\gg1$ and $Re = \\sqrt{Ra/Pr}/\\sqrt{12}$, thus making BRB the simplest wall-bounded convective system exhibiting the so called ultimate regime of convection. These scaling laws, derived analytically through a matched asymptotic analysis are fully supported by the results of the accompanying numerical simulations. A major difference with realistic natural convection is the absence of turbulence. The BRB dynamics is stationary at any $Ra$ number above the onset of convection. This feature results from a nonlinear saturation mechanism whose existence is grasped by means of a two-mode truncated equation system and via a stability analysis of the convective regime.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. Pyramid Attention Networks for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: \"architecture integration patterns compression\"*\n\n*Thomas S. Huang, Yulun Zhang, Yiqun Mei, Humphrey Shi, Yun Fu, Yuqian Zhou, Yuchen Fan, Jiahui Yu, Ding Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-similarity refers to the image prior widely used in image restoration algorithms that small but similar patterns tend to occur at different locations and scales. However, recent advanced deep convolutional neural network based methods for image restoration do not take full advantage of self-similarities by relying on self-attention neural modules that only process information at the same scale. To solve this problem, we present a novel Pyramid Attention module for image restoration, which captures long-range feature correspondences from a multi-scale feature pyramid. Inspired by the fact that corruptions, such as noise or compression artifacts, drop drastically at coarser image scales, our attention module is designed to be able to borrow clean signals from their \"clean\" correspondences at the coarser levels. The proposed pyramid attention module is a generic building block that can be flexibly integrated into various neural architectures. Its effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks: image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifact reduction, and super resolution. Without any bells and whistles, our PANet (pyramid attention module with simple network backbones) can produce state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and visual quality. Our code will be available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Pyramid-Attention-Networks\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations, stability analysis, and architecture integration, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Implementation Strategies for Adaptive Compression\n- The paper on \"CASAK-V: Dynamic Sparse Attention and Adaptive KV-Cache Compression\" introduces dynamic, context-aware mechanisms for sparse attention and KV-cache compression.
