Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F. Chen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, Patrick Gallinari*\n\n**Published in:** Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs that effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models are a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5.

This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state space models attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches.

However, due to their short temporal attention span, these models suffer from error accumulation and drift. In this paper, we propose a new method that captures long-term dependencies through a transformer-style temporal attention model. We introduce an encoder-decoder structure to summarize features and create a compact mesh representation of the system state, to allow the temporal model to operate on a low-dimensional mesh representations in a memory efficient manner. Our method outperforms a competitive GNN baseline on several complex fluid dynamics prediction tasks, from sonic shocks to vascular flow. We demonstrate stable rollouts without the need for training noise and show perfectly phase-stable predictions even for very long sequences.

We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by integrating efficient state space models with attention mechanisms, several recent studies and models are particularly relevant:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Taipan Model\nThe Taipan model is a novel hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of state space models (SSMs) with the expressive power of selective attention layers. Taipan integrates Mamba-2, a state space model, with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to identify tokens requiring long-range interactions. This approach balances the efficiency of SSMs with the performance of Transformers, allowing for accurate predictions over long context lengths (up to 1 million tokens) while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### Mamba and State Space Duality\nThe Mamba framework, which uses state space models, has been enhanced with concepts like State Space Duality (SSD). This allows for the simplification of matrix operations into scalar forms, improving the efficiency and scalability of the model. Mamba's ability to handle long sequences efficiently and its integration with attention-like mechanisms (such as local self-attention) make it a promising candidate for improving autoregressive language models.\n\n## Efficiency and Hardware Optimization\n\n### Memory Efficiency\nState space models like Mamba and Taipan are designed to achieve constant or near-linear memory usage, which is a significant improvement over the quadratic memory requirements of traditional Transformer models. This makes them more hardware-efficient, especially for long-context tasks.\n\n### Computational Efficiency\nTaipan's use of selective attention layers ensures that only relevant tokens are processed with attention, reducing the computational cost associated with long-range interactions. This constrained attention budget helps in extending accurate predictions to long sequences without compromising efficiency.\n\n### Hardware Utilization\nThe quantization methods and discrete formulations used in state space models can be optimized for resource-constrained hardware. For example, the discretization process in Mamba and the use of convolutional implementations can make these models more deployable on various hardware platforms, enhancing their practical applicability.\n\n## Applications and Benchmarks\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\nStudies have shown that models like SC-MAMBA2 and Taipan outperform existing state-of-the-art models in various tasks. SC-MAMBA2, for instance, has demonstrated superior performance in cell annotation, multi-batch data integration, and perturbation prediction, highlighting the potential of SSMs in complex data analysis.\n\n### Video and Text Processing\nThe application of state space models in video generation and text processing further underscores their versatility. For example, using SSMs in video diffusion models reduces memory requirements and improves performance compared to attention-based models, indicating similar benefits could be achieved in text processing tasks.\n\nBy integrating these advancements, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and hardware-optimized autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of both state space models and attention mechanisms.\n",

However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/39 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n4. \u00a7B. 2 presents a detailed derivation. Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 44/63 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\n[68] M. Tomita.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical state representations memory efficient attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Implicit Memory Transformer for Computationally Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations memory efficient attention*\n\n*Matthew Raffel, Lizhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of theart approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Abstract:** Simultaneous speech translation is an essential communication task difficult for humans whereby a translation is generated concurrently with oncoming speech inputs. For such a streaming task, transformers using block processing to break an input sequence into segments have achieved state-of-the-art performance at a reduced cost. Current methods to allow information to propagate across segments, including left context and memory banks, have faltered as they are both insufficient representations and unnecessarily expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose an Implicit Memory Transformer that implicitly retains memory through a new left context method, removing the need to explicitly represent memory with memory banks. We generate the left context from the attention output of the previous segment and include it in the keys and values of the current segment's attention calculation. Experiments on the MuST-C dataset show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of-the-art approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Oates, James Holt*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) to make the Hrrformer the first viable Transformer for such long malware classification sequences and up to $280\\times$ faster to train on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, self-attention has become the dominant paradigm for sequence modeling in a variety of domains. However, in domains with very long sequence lengths the $\\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ memory and $\\mathcal{O}(T^2 H)$ compute costs can make using transformers infeasible. Motivated by problems in malware detection, where sequence lengths of $T \\geq 100,000$ are a roadblock to deep learning, we re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). In doing so we perform the same high-level strategy of the standard self-attention: a set of queries matching against a set of keys, and returning a weighted response of the values for each key. Implemented as a ``Hrrformer'' we obtain several benefits including $\\mathcal{O}(T H \\log H)$ time complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(T H)$ space complexity, and convergence in $10\\times$ fewer epochs. Nevertheless, the Hrrformer achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy on LRA benchmarks and we are able to learn with just a single layer. Combined, these benefits make our Hrrformer the first viable Transformer for such long malware classification sequences and up to $280\\times$ faster to train on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Drawing inspiration from the correlation between roles and agent's behavior patterns, we propose a novel framework of **A**ttention-guided **CO**ntrastive **R**ole representation learning for **M**ARL (**ACORM**) to promote behavior heterogeneity, knowledge transfer, and skillful coordination across agents. First, we introduce mutual information maximization to formalize role representation learning, derive a contrastive learning objective, and concisely approximate the distribution of negative pairs. Second, we leverage an attention mechanism to prompt the global state to attend to learned role representations in value decomposition, implicitly guiding agent coordination in a skillful role space to yield more expressive credit assignment.

Accurate Learning of Graph Representations with Graph Multiset Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations memory efficient attention*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Minki Kang, Jinheon Baek*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet, obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple sum or average over all node representations considers all node features equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods, on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** accurate-learning-of-graph-representations\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. HR-Pro: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization via Hierarchical Reliability Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations memory efficient attention*\n\n*Nong Sang, Changxin Gao, Zhiwu Qing, Xiaohao Xu, Xiang Wang, Huaxin Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PSTAL) is an emerging research direction for label-efficient learning. However, current methods mainly focus on optimizing the network either at the snippet-level or the instance-level, neglecting the inherent reliability of point annotations at both levels. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Reliability Propagation (HR-Pro) framework, which consists of two reliability-aware stages: Snippet-level Discrimination Learning and Instance-level Completeness Learning, both stages explore the efficient propagation of high-confidence cues in point annotations. For snippet-level learning, we introduce an online-updated memory to store reliable snippet prototypes for each class. We then employ a Reliability-aware Attention Block to capture both intra-video and inter-video dependencies of snippets, resulting in more discriminative and robust snippet representation. For instance-level learning, we propose a point-based proposal generation approach as a means of connecting snippets and instances, which produces high-confidence proposals for further optimization at the instance level. Through multi-level reliability-aware learning, we obtain more reliable confidence scores and more accurate temporal boundaries of predicted proposals. Our HR-Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, including an impressive average mAP of 60.3% on THUMOS14. Notably, our HR-Pro largely surpasses all previous point-supervised methods, and even outperforms several competitive fully supervised methods.

Attentive Memory Networks: Efficient Machine Reading for Conversational Search\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations memory efficient attention*\n\n*Maarten de Rijke, Tom Kenter*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in conversational systems have changed the search paradigm.\nTraditionally, a user poses a query to a search engine that returns an answer\nbased on its index, possibly leveraging external knowledge bases and\nconditioning the response on earlier interactions in the search session. In a\nnatural conversation, there is an additional source of information to take into\naccount: utterances produced earlier in a conversation can also be referred to\nand a conversational IR system has to keep track of information conveyed by the\nuser during the conversation, even if it is implicit.\n  We argue that the process of building a representation of the conversation\ncan be framed as a machine reading task, where an automated system is presented\nwith a number of statements about which it should answer questions. The\nquestions should be answered solely by referring to the statements provided,\nwithout consulting external knowledge. The time is right for the information\nretrieval community to embrace this task, both as a stand-alone task and\nintegrated in a broader conversational search setting.\n  In this paper, we focus on machine reading as a stand-alone task and present\nthe Attentive Memory Network (AMN), an end-to-end trainable machine reading\nalgorithm. Its key contribution is in efficiency, achieved by having an\nhierarchical input encoder, iterating over the input only once. Speed is an\nimportant requirement in the setting of conversational search, as gaps between\nconversational turns have a detrimental effect on naturalness. On 20 datasets\ncommonly used for evaluating machine reading algorithms we show that the AMN\nachieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models, while using\nconsiderably fewer computations.\n\n**Published:** 2017-12-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on hierarchical state representations and memory-efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Hierarchical State Representations\n\n1. **Hierarchical Feature Encoder**:\n   The paper on \"Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs with Semantic Space Alignment\" introduces a hierarchical feature encoder that captures diverse aspects of time series data. This encoder uses both data-specific and task-specific embeddings, which can be adapted to hierarchical state representations in language models. The hierarchical encoding strategy effectively extracts features from both local and global levels, enhancing the model's performance.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Reformer Attention**:\n   The Reformer model is mentioned in the context of efficient attention computation. It reduces memory usage while quickly learning long-term sequence dependencies, which is crucial for memory-efficient attention mechanisms. This approach can be integrated into hierarchical state representations to improve efficiency.\n\n## Integration and Practical Implementation Details\n\n1. **Memristor-Based Attention Acceleration**:\n   The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" presents a hardware-efficient approach to attention computation using memristor-based in-memory computing. This method integrates computation into memory, reducing power consumption and latency, which is essential for practical deployment of memory-efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n## Hierarchical and Efficient Architectures\n\n1. **Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (h-GNN)**:\n   Although the h-GNN is primarily designed for image matching, its hierarchical structure and the use of successive clustering (SC+PCA) to preserve local and global information can inspire similar hierarchical architectures in language models. This approach ensures efficient processing and preservation of critical information at multiple levels.\n\n## State Space Duality and Selective State Spaces\n\nWhile the provided search results do not directly mention state space duality or selective state spaces, the analysis note suggests that these concepts are crucial. For instance, integrating selective state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, as discussed in the analysis note, can enhance content-based reasoning and improve efficiency. The \"Mamba\" and \"LOCOST\" models mentioned in the analysis note are examples of how SSMs can be optimized for linear-time algorithms and efficient handling of long sequences, which can be applied to hierarchical state representations and memory-efficient attention in autoregressive language models[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Integrating Hierarchical Encoders with Attention**:\n  Combining hierarchical feature encoders with memory-efficient attention mechanisms, such as Reformer attention or memristor-based acceleration, could significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n- **Hardware-Aware Implementations**:\n  Implementing these models with hardware-aware techniques, like memristor-based computing, can further optimize their practical deployment.\n- **Balancing State Compression and Information Preservation**:\n  Ensuring a careful balance between state compression and information preservation is crucial for maintaining the expressiveness of the model while improving efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these concepts and techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage hierarchical state representations and memory-efficient attention mechanisms.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module.

We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (Avg.

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization For Open Set Detection from Imbalanced Data\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Hitesh Sapkota, Qi Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization (AREO) is proposed that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO).\n\n**Abstract:** Open set detection (OSD) aims at identifying data samples of an unknown class ( i.e., open set) from those of known classes ( i.e., closed set) based on a model trained from closed set samples. However, a closed set may involve a highly imbalanced class distribution. Accurately differentiating open set samples and those from a minority class in the closed set poses a fundamental challenge as the model may be equally uncertain when recognizing samples from the minority class. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization (AREO) that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO). To avoid the model to primarily focus on the most difficult samples by following the standard DRO, adaptive DRO training is performed, which is governed by a novel multi-scheduler learning mechanism to ensure an optimal model training behavior that gives sufficient attention to the difficult samples and the minority class while capable of learning common patterns from the majority classes. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outputs uncertainty scores that can clearly separate samples from closed and open sets, respectively, and the detection results outperform the competitive baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Recent advancements in the field provide several mechanisms for speeding up the training, including {\\em compressed communication}, {\\em variance reduction} and {\\em acceleration}. However, none of these methods is capable of exploiting the inherently rich data-dependent smoothness structure of the local losses beyond standard smoothness constants. In this paper, we argue that when training supervised models, {\\em smoothness matrices} -- information-rich generalizations of the ubiquitous smoothness constants -- can and should be exploited for further dramatic gains, both in theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses. To showcase the power of this tool, we describe how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity.

DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic BERT model, which can run at adaptive width and depth, is proposed (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computational and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually reduce the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size, and can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can run at adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allows both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 297  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Adaptive Prefix Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Language Model Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Zhenru Zhang, Chuanqi Tan, Haiyang Xu, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Songfang Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT), which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers that will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on various downstream tasks with whole parameters is prohibitively expensive. Hence, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has attracted attention that only optimizes a few task-specific parameters with the frozen pre-trained model. In this work, we focus on prefix tuning, which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers. Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism. Experiments on the SuperGLUE and NER datasets show the effectiveness of APT. In addition, taking the gate as a probing, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the variable prefix.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Improving Natural Language Understanding with Computation-Efficient Retrieval Representation Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Shangyu Wu, Ying Xiong, Yufei Cui, Xue Liu, Buzhou Tang, Tei-Wei Kuo, Chun Jason Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new paradigm of RA named ReFusion is proposed, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization, which directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models.\n\n**Abstract:** Retrieval-based augmentations (RA) incorporating knowledge from an external database into language models have greatly succeeded in various knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks. However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks is still challenging. Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals with inputs to improve model performance. Unfortunately, the use of retrieval concatenation-based augmentations causes an increase in the input length, substantially raising the computational demands of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes a new paradigm of RA named \\textbf{ReFusion}, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization. Unlike previous works, ReFusion directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models. Specifically, ReFusion leverages an adaptive retrieval integrator to seek the optimal combination of the proposed ranking schemes across different model layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance in various NKI tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design focusing on adaptive compression techniques for attention mechanisms and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key findings and directions from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques for Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Soft Prompt Compression\nThe paper on \"Prompt Compression for Large Language Models\" discusses soft prompt compression methods, which can be seen as a form of attention optimization. These methods involve compressing prompts into a shorter sequence of tokens, reducing the computational costs associated with long input sequences. Techniques like GIST tokens and the 500xCompressor method compress prompts while maintaining detailed information, which can be beneficial for reducing the input length and computational requirements of attention mechanisms.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention and Memory Optimization\nThe analysis note highlights the importance of hierarchical attention mechanisms and bounded memory approaches. For instance, hierarchical gating mechanisms can control information flow, and constant memory attention blocks (CMAB) can compute outputs in constant memory, which aligns with the need for adaptive compression and efficient memory management.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nThe paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This design significantly accelerates transformer self-attention operations by integrating computation into memory, reducing power consumption and latency.

CIM-based architectures, such as those using ReRAM, can optimize memory usage and computational efficiency, which is crucial for deploying large language models on hardware.\n\n## Combining Insights for Autoregressive LM Improvement\n\n### Adaptive Compression and Hierarchical Processing\nCombining soft prompt compression methods with hierarchical attention mechanisms can help in balancing local and global information while reducing computational costs. This approach can be integrated with bounded memory control frameworks to ensure efficient memory management.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\nImplementing these techniques on hardware-efficient platforms, such as memristor-based accelerators or CIM-based architectures, can significantly enhance the performance and scalability of autoregressive language models. These hardware-specific optimizations can improve throughput and reduce power consumption, making the models more practical for deployment.\n\n### Future Directions\n- Investigate integrating soft prompt compression with hierarchical attention mechanisms to optimize both memory usage and computational efficiency.\n- Explore the use of memristor-based and CIM-based hardware accelerators to implement these optimized attention mechanisms.\n- Develop novel approaches that combine bounded memory with hierarchical structures to enhance the scalability and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and hardware-friendly autoregressive language models.\n",

We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Therefore, a compilation-based optimization \ufb02ow with automatic tensor generation and parameter tuning is necessary for ef\ufb01cient model deployment.

DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: hardware specific attention optimization streaming compression*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic BERT model, which can run at adaptive width and depth, is proposed (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computational and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually reduce the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size, and can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can run at adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allows both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 297  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 3. Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware specific attention optimization streaming compression*\n\n*Mengzhou Xia, Zexuan Zhong, Danqi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data.\n\n**Abstract:** The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 152  (*Influential: 30*)\n\n#### 4. Holistic Adversarially Robust Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware specific attention optimization streaming compression*\n\n*Qi Zhao, Christian Wressnegger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel method, HARP, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than prior work, and fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic regularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the different objectives.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks can be drastically shrunk in size by removing redundant parameters. While crucial for the deployment on resource-constraint hardware, oftentimes, compression comes with a severe drop in accuracy and lack of adversarial robustness. Despite recent advances, counteracting both aspects has only succeeded for moderate compression rates so far. We propose a novel method, HARP, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than prior work. For this, we consider the network holistically. We learn a global compression strategy that optimizes how many parameters (compression rate) and which parameters (scoring connections) to prune specific to each layer individually. Our method fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic regularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the different objectives. It starts by favoring robustness before shifting focus on reaching the target compression rate and only then handles the objectives equally. The learned compression strategies allow us to maintain the pre-trained model\u2019s natural accuracy and its adversarial robustness for a reduction by 99% of the network\u2019s original size. Moreover, we observe a crucial influence of non-uniform compression across layers.

The devices that execute complex models are becoming increasingly heterogeneous as we see a flourishing of domain-specific accelerators being offered as hardware accelerators in addition to CPUs. These trends necessitate distributing the workload across multiple devices. Recent work has shown that significant gains can be obtained with model parallelism, i.e, partitioning a neural network's computational graph onto multiple devices. In particular, this form of parallelism assumes a pipeline of devices, which is fed a stream of samples and yields high throughput for training and inference of DNNs. However, for such settings (large models and multiple heterogeneous devices), we require automated algorithms and toolchains that can partition the ML workload across devices. In this paper, we identify and isolate the structured optimization problem at the core of device placement of DNN operators, for both inference and training, especially in modern pipelined settings. We then provide algorithms that solve this problem to optimality. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our approaches using several contemporary DNN computation graphs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-specific attention optimizations and efficient implementations of streaming compression techniques, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Attention Optimizations\n\n1. **Memristor-Based Attention Acceleration**:\n   The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach optimizes the matrix multiplication operations in the self-attention mechanism, reducing computational latency and power consumption. The design utilizes memristor crossbar arrays to perform analog matrix operations, which can significantly improve the efficiency of attention computations.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Streaming Compression\n\n2. **KV-Cache Quantization and Compression**:\n   The work on \"QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving\" presents a method for quantizing the KV cache in large language models. This involves adaptive bit-width assignment based on token saliency, normalized attention scores, and channel-separable token-wise quantization. These techniques reduce memory overhead and maintain accuracy, which is crucial for efficient streaming and compression in autoregressive models.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Performance Improvements\n\n3. **SmoothAttention and Progressive Quantization**:\n   The same paper discusses the \"SmoothAttention\" method, which reduces the error of 4-bit quantization of the Key cache and is compatible with RoPE operations. It also introduces progressive quantization of weights to comply with 8-bit compute after dequantizing 4-bit weights. These methods are designed to optimize the serving of large language models, ensuring fast generation speeds and good compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss.\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms and Memory Management\n\n4. **Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA)**:\n   LoMA is a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, reducing memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. Combining LoMA with attention sinks and hierarchical memory management can provide efficient streaming capabilities, as mentioned in the analysis note. This approach balances access speed and capacity, which is essential for practical implementations[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimizations\n\n5. **Matrix Decomposition and Kernel Fusion**:\n   Techniques like FlashFFTConv, which use matrix decomposition to compute FFT using matrix multiply units, enable kernel fusion for long sequences. This reduces I/O operations and can be integrated with hardware accelerators to improve throughput and efficiency in attention computations[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these approaches\u2014hardware-specific attention optimizations using memristor-based accelerators, efficient KV-cache quantization and compression, and hierarchical memory management with lossless compression\u2014the researchers can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Transformer-based LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023, Anil et al., 2023; Groeneveld et al. 2024) have a constrained context-dependent memory, due to the nature of the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism in Transformers exhibits quadratic complexity in both memory footprint and computation time. For example, the attention Key-Value (KV) states have 3TB memory footprint for a 500B model with batch size 512 and context length 2048 (Pope et al. 2023). Indeed, scaling LLMs to longer sequences (i.e. 1 M tokens) is challenging with the standard Transformer architectures and serving longer and longer context models becomes costly financially. Compressive memory systems promise to be more scalable and efficient than the attention mechanism for extremely long sequences (Kanerva, 1988; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Instead of using an array that grows with the input sequence length, a compressive memory primarily maintains a fixed number of parameters to store and recall information with a bounded storage and computation costs. In the compressive memory, new information is added to the memory by changing its parameters with an objective that this information can be recovered back later on. However, the LLMs in their current state have yet to see an effective, practical compressive memory technique that balances simplicity along with quality. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enables Transformer LLMs to effectively process infinitely long inputs with bounded memory footprint and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention (Figure 1). The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014, Vaswani et al. 2017) and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. Such a subtle but critical modification to the Transformer attention layer enables a natural extension of existing LLMs to infinitely long contexts via continual pre-training and finetuning. Our Infini-attention reuses all the key, value and query states of the standard attention computation for long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. We store old KV states of the attention in the compressive memory, instead of discarding them like in the standard attention mechanism. We then retrieve the values from the memory by using the attention query states when processing subsequent sequences. To compute the final contextual output, the Infini-attention aggregates the long-term memory-retrieved values and the local attention contexts. In our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms baseline models on longcontext language modeling benchmarks while having $114 x$ comprehension ratio in terms of memory size. The model achieves even better perplexity when trained with 100 K sequence length. A 1B LLM naturally scales to 1M sequence length and solves the passkey retrieval task when injected with Infini-attention. Finally, we show that a 8B model with Infiniattention reaches a new SOTA result on a 500 K length book summarization task after continual pre-training and task fine-tuning. In summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce a practical and yet powerful attention mechanism - Infini-attention with long-term compressive memory and local causal attention for efficiently modeling both long and short-range contextual dependencies. 2. Infini-attention introduces minimal change to the standard scaled dot-product attention and supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long-context adaptation by design. 3. Our approach enables Transformer LLMs to scale to infinitely long context with a bounded memory and compute resource by processing extremely long inputs in a streaming fashion. ## 2 Background\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process a single token $x_{t}$ at each step $t$ and computes a recurrent hidden state $h_{t}$ to represent an entire input sequence Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Maass et al. 2002):\n\n$$\nh_{t}=R N N\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe RNN computation is very efficient since the model maintains only a fixed-size vector $h_{t}$ for input sequence. However, for processing long sequences it becomes difficult to store entire contextual information into a single fixed-size vector and this limitation had implications on RNNs utility in certain tasks (Kaiser \\& Sutskever, 2015). To address the limitation, people extended the standard RNNs with an external memory component that can be read from and written to. One such an instance is Metalearned Neural Memory (MNM) (Munkhdalai et al., 2019):\n\n$$\nh_{t}, \\theta_{t}=M N M\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}, \\theta_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nMNM learns an additional memory state $\\theta$ parameterized by a feed-forward neural network (FFN) and uses query, key and value vectors (QKV) to interact with the memory, similar to the attention mechanism. To store information, it modifies the parameters of the FFN by using the key vectors as input and the value vectors for the target, and to read memory\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dbb8cf178811d16c1412g-03.jpg?height=663&width=1391&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 2: Infini-Transformer (top) has an entire context history whereas Transformer-XL (bottom) discards old contexts since it caches the KV states for the last segment only. entries, it forward-passes the query vectors through the memory FFN and retrieves its corresponding value. Like RNNs, the memory state is still bounded in MNM. Unlike the RNNs, the attention mechanism however doesn't maintain a recurrent state and only performs a feed-forward computation on input sequence segment $X_{s}$ :\n\n$$\nO_{s}=\\operatorname{attention}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe attention output $O_{s}$ is simply passed to the next layer and no state is carried over to the next input sequence $X_{s+1}$ at the same attention layer. In the attention layer, in order to capture the dependency between the consequent segments $X_{s}$ and $X_{s+1}$, one needs to process them altogether at the same time and this process becomes a bottleneck requiring large computational resources as the length of input sequence grows more and more. To improve the efficiency while still being able to benefit from the expressiveness of the attention mechanism, this work introduces a recurrent attention layer. ## 3 Method\n\nFigure 2 compares our model, Infini-Transformer, and Transformer-XL (Dai et al, 2019). Similar to Transformer-XL, Infini-Transformer operates on a sequence of segments. We compute the standard causal dot-product attention context within each segment. So the dot-product attention computation is local in a sense that it covers a total $N$ number of tokens of the current segment with index $S$ ( $N$ is the segment length). The local attention (Dai et al., 2019), however, discards the attention states of the previous segment when processing the next one. In Infini-Transformers, instead of leaving out the old KV attention states, we propose to reuse them to maintain the entire context history with a compressive memory. So each attention layer of Infini-Transformers has both global compressive and local fine-grained states. We call such an efficient attention mechanism Infini-attention, which is illustrated in Figure 1 and described formally in the following sections. ### 3.1 Infini-attention\n\nAs shown Figure 1, our Infini-attention is a recurrent attention mechanism that computes both local and global context states and combine them for its output. Similar to multi-head\nattention (MHA), it maintains $H$ number of parallel compressive memory per attention layer ( $H$ is the number of attention heads) in addition to the dot-product attention and like the RNNs and MNM, it maintains a recurrent memory state to efficiently track the long sequence context:\n\n$$\nO_{s}, M_{s}=\\text { infini-attention }\\left(X_{s}, M_{s-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.1.1 Scaled Dot-product Attention\n\nThe multi-head scaled dot-product attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), specially its self-attention variant (Munkhdalai et al., 2016. Cheng et al., 2016), has been the main building block in LLMs. The MHA's strong capability to model context-dependent dynamic computation and its conveniences of temporal masking have been leveraged extensively in the autoregressive generative models. A single head in the vanilla MHA computes its attention context $A_{\\text {dot }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from sequence of input segments $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ as follows. First, it computes attention query, key, and value states:\n\n$$\nK=X W_{K}, V=X W_{V} \\text { and } Q=X W_{Q} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nHere, $W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ and $W_{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ are trainable projection matrices. Then, the attention context is calculated as a weighted average of all other values as\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {dot }}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{\\text {model }}}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nFor MHA, we compute $H$ number of attention context vectors for each sequence element in parallel, concatenate them along the second dimension and then finally project the concatenated vector to the model space to obtain the attention output. ### 3.1.2 Compressive Memory\n\nIn Infini-attention, instead of computing new memory entries for compressive memory, we reuse the query, key and value states ( $Q, K$ and $V$ ) from the dot-product attention computation. The state sharing and reusing between the dot-product attention and compressive memory not only enables efficient plug-in-play long-context adaptation but also speeds up training and inference. Similar to the prior work (Munkhdalai et al., 2019), our goal is to store bindings of key and value states in the compressive memory and retrieve by using the query vectors. While there are different forms of compressive memory proposed in the literature (Hopfield, 1982; Kanerva, 1988; Schlag et al., 2019; Munkhdalai et al., 2019), for simplicity and computational efficiency, in this work we parameterize the memory with an associative matrix (Schlag et al., 2020). This approach further allows us to cast the memory update and retrieval process as linear attention mechanism (Shen et al., 2018) and to leverage stable training techniques from the related methods. Specially, we adopt the update rule and retrieval mechanism by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) mainly due to its simplicity and competitive performance. Memory retrieval. In Infini-attention, we retrieve new content $A_{\\text {mem }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from the memory $M_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ by using the query $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ as:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {mem }}=\\frac{\\sigma(Q) M_{s-1}}{\\sigma(Q) z_{s-1}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\sigma$ and $z_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }}}$ are a nonlinear activation function and a normalization term, respectively.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** SPARSEK Attention is introduced, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/41 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nFor linear attention, we utilize the kernelization proposed by Katharopoulos et al. [38]. Additionally, we compare our methods to recent linear attention works that employ their own architectures rather than the GPT-2 architecture: GLA [77] and RetNet [67]. As the smallest GLA and RetNet is 340 M , We modify their hyperparameters to align with our setting. Detailed hyperparameters and results of other configurations can be found in Appendix C.1. We trained all models on the OpenWebText ${ }^{3}$ corpus for 10,000 steps, varying the context length. The results are presented in Table 1. Our SPARSEK+SW method consistently outperforms all previously\n\n[^2]established efficient attention methods. Particularly, SparseK+SW offers superior performance and has lower time complexity compared to previous learnable sparse attention methods, such as hash attention. Furthermore, linear attention methods, such as Linear+SW, GLA, and RetNet, demonstrate limitations, particularly in modeling long contexts. However, when combining linear attention with SPARSEK attention, we observed additional performance gains over SPARSEK+SW, even surpassing full attention. This suggests the potential of exploring a mixture of different attention methods for more efficient modeling. ### 4.2 Fine-tuning Existing Models\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-08.jpg?height=349&width=1354&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=381)\n\nFigure 2: Perplexity on the held-out set of fine-tuned models. L denotes the training context length. We replace the standard full attention in Pythia 160M, Pythia 410M [6] and TinyLlama 1.1B [80] with our SPARSEK attention and sliding window attention. The models are then fine-tuned over a few steps to ensure compatibility with the modified attention modules. Here we only consider sliding window attention because other efficient attention methods often require additional changes of the model architecture and sliding window attention is reported to be efficient in Chen et al. [11]. In fine-tuning, the NTK-aware interpolation [7] is adopted to extend the limit of pretrained positional encodings. For the Pythia models, we utilize a $1 \\%$ sampled subset of the SlimPajama dataset ${ }^{4}$ [63] to perform fine-tuning on moderate-length settings (i.e., 4 k and 8 k ). In contrast, we use an upsampled dataset comprising long documents [25] to fine-tune the TinyLlama models on long-length settings (i.e., 8 k and 16 k ). Training hyperparameters are listed in Appendix C.2. In Figure 2, we report the perplexity on the held-out set across various levels of sparsity and training context lengths. Extending the training context length and increasing the context size generally benefit all types of attention mechanisms. When matching the KV size, our SparseK+SW attention consistently outperforms sliding window attention. For the TinyLlama models, SparseK+SW attention achieves comparable perplexity using only half the KV size required by sliding window attention. These results underscore the advantages of a more adaptable context as implemented in SparseK+SW. We further evaluate TinyLlama 1.1B, fine-tuned with an 8 k context window, across additional tasks as presented in the following sections. ### 4.3 Retrieval-based Evaluation and Length Extrapolation\n\nA common concern with sparse attention is its potential to neglect informative history. To investigate this, we evaluated our fine-tuned models on the passkey retrieval task [47], along with two baseline methods that require no training: dynamic NTK [7, 23] and LM-Infinite [33]. The results are presented in Figure 3a. It is evident that the sliding window approach fails even within the trained context length. Furthermore, among the training-free methods, NTK utilizes full attention and extends the context length by a factor of four, whereas the memory-efficient method LM-Infinite fails in extrapolation. In contrast, SPARSEK+SW is memory-efficient while maintaining performance for context lengths well beyond four times longer. We also analyze the perplexity of tokens in various positional buckets within a long context, as depicted in Figure 3b. In the language modeling task, SW demonstrates the ability to effectively manage contexts four times longer than standard models, although it is less competitive in relatively short contexts. While SPARSEK+SW fails at contexts extending to 26 k tokens, it outperforms both NTK and fine-tuned full attention models.

The choice of language is based on the fact that the training corpus of TinyLlama is primarily in English. We test all models using greedy decoding, with the evaluation context size set to 8192 . All results are presented in Table 2. Full attention offers the best performance but incurs the highest memory cost. Sliding window attention is memory-efficient; however, it results in significant performance degradation. In contrast, our SPARSEK+SW attention not only demonstrates strong performance but also achieves high memory efficiency. Notably, SPARSEK+SW outperforms the training-free method, NTK, and the inference-time KV cache compression method, H2O [81]. This suggests the benefits of maintaining consistency between training and inference. However, SparseK+SW underperforms fine-tuned full attention, representing a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Table 2: Results on LongBench. * denotes that the method is training-free. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ We use 512 globel (heavy-hitter) KV cache and 512 local KV cache in H2O. | Model | Single-Doc QA |  |  | Multi-Doc QA |  |  | Summarziation |  |  | Few-shot Learning |  |  | Synthetic |  | Code |  | Avg. |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| NTK $^{*}$ <br> $w=8192$ | 4.34 | 10.30 | 14.54 | 6.49 | 9.19 | 3.49 | 11.77 | 7.84 | 3.62 | 49.5 | 55.17 | 22.66 | 1.21 | 3.38 | 52.19 | 48.90 | 19.04 |\n| Full <br> $w=8192$ | 3.95 | 13.07 | 13.16 | 6.81 | 10.77 | 3.51 | 15.17 | 6.12 | 8.30 | 61.00 | 65.15 | 26.02 | 0.39 | 2.37 | 56.72 | 50.36 | 21.42 |\n| SW <br> $w=1024$ | 1.34 | 8.69 | 5.41 | 2.76 | 4.46 | 0.48 | 11.78 | 4.25 | 2.39 | 25.50 | 13.43 | 5.33 | 2.3 | 0.50 | 52.22 | 27.50 | 10.52 |\n| SparseK+SW <br> $k=w=512$ | 5.19 | 14.29 | 13.24 | 6.85 | 9.21 | 3.83 | 14.11 | 5.97 | 5.85 | 55.00 | 52.06 | 24.79 | 0.61 | 2.61 | 53.90 | 50.89 | 19.90 |\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe propose SpArSEK attention, a new approach to sparse attention that achieves both computational and memory efficiency. Within self-attention, we use an additional scoring network evaluating the importance of each key-value pair and select the top- $k$ pairs. We propose the differentiable SPARSEK operator, a relaxation of TOPK, to enable gradient-based optimization. Experiments on language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate consistent improvements compared to previous efficient attention methods. ## References\n\n[1] Joshua Ainslie, Tao Lei, Michiel de Jong, Santiago Ontan'on, Siddhartha Brahma, Yury Zemlyanskiy, David C.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n#### 2. SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis method stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. - Our SinkLoRA performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate its performance on the PG19, Proof-pile, and LongBench datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-04.jpg?height=375&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Segmentation and Reassembly process in SF-Attn. The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Research has shown that methods like the ones used in Transformer-XL and Longformer can be effective. For instance, Transformer-XL uses a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a relative positional encoding scheme to handle long sequences efficiently.\n- **Efficiency**: Studies on streaming attention often highlight the importance of stable attention computations. For example, the \"Reformer\" model uses reversible attention and locality-sensitive hashing to reduce computational complexity and memory usage, making it more efficient for streaming data.\n\n### Lossless KV Cache Compression Techniques\n\n- **Existing Approaches**: Lossless compression of key-value pairs is essential for memory efficiency. Techniques such as quantization and sparse representations can be used. For instance, the \"Compressed Attention\" mechanism uses quantization to reduce the memory footprint of attention weights without significant loss in accuracy.\n- **Adaptive Compression**: Adaptive compression based on token importance is a promising area. This could involve dynamic quantization or pruning strategies that prioritize critical tokens, similar to how some models use attention weights to determine which tokens to retain or compress.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Management\n\n- **Multi-Level Memory Architecture**: Hierarchical memory structures are vital for retaining context over extended sequences. Models like the \"Hierarchical Transformer\" use a multi-level architecture to manage memory efficiently, allowing for better context retention and reduced memory usage.\n- **Impact on Performance**: Hierarchical memory management can significantly impact performance by optimizing hardware utilization. For example, using a combination of short-term and long-term memory components can help in handling both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Integration with Existing Models\n\n- **Alignment with GAUs and RWKV**: The modifications should be evaluated in the context of existing architectures like Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and RWKV. For instance, integrating streaming attention into GLA could enhance its ability to handle long sequences, while hierarchical memory management could improve RWKV's context retention capabilities.\n- **Novelty and Effectiveness**: Comparing the proposed modifications with existing solutions like Gated Linear Attention and RWKV will help in assessing their novelty and effectiveness. This involves evaluating how these new components align with or differ from existing architectures and their impact on performance metrics such as accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### Impact on Model Performance\n\n- **Accuracy and Robustness**: The impact on accuracy and robustness needs to be evaluated through experiments. For example, studies have shown that streaming attention mechanisms can improve accuracy on long-sequence tasks while maintaining robustness against input variations.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The efficiency and scalability of the model should be assessed in terms of computational resources and memory usage. Hierarchical memory management and lossless KV cache compression can significantly improve these aspects, making the model more viable for large-scale applications.\n\n### Useful References and Insights\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly address the specific components of the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal, here are some insights and directions based on the general context:\n\n- **Streaming Attention**: Research on multimodal deep learning and semantic segmentation networks, although not directly related, highlights the importance of efficient feature extraction and processing. This can be analogous to the need for efficient attention mechanisms in streaming data contexts.\n- **KV Cache Compression**: The concept of feature compression and efficient data representation in models like GLE-Net can provide insights into how to compress key-value pairs without losing critical information.\n- **Hierarchical Memory Management**: The use of multi-level architectures in semantic segmentation networks and other deep learning models can serve as a reference for designing hierarchical memory structures in autoregressive models.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **External Searches**: Focus on arXiv, Papers with Code, and Semantic Scholar using keywords like \"streaming attention mechanisms,\" \"lossless KV cache compression,\" and \"hierarchical memory management in transformers.\"\n2. **Internal Library Search**: Use the detailed description to search for foundational studies and closely related works within the internal research library.\n3. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine search queries based on initial findings to delve deeper into specific aspects that require more investigation.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the researcher can comprehensively evaluate the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal and ensure it advances the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models while maintaining or enhancing performance metrics.\n\n### Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Streaming Attention**: Investigate how current streaming attention mechanisms handle unbounded sequences and their computational efficiency.\n- **KV Cache Compression**: Analyze existing compression techniques and their impact on model performance, focusing on adaptive compression methods.\n- **Hierarchical Memory Management**: Examine multi-level memory architectures in existing models and their benefits in terms of context retention and hardware utilization.\n- **Integration and Impact**: Evaluate how these modifications align with or differ from existing architectures and their potential impact on accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### List of References\n\n- **Transformer-XL**: For insights into segment-level recurrence and relative positional encoding.\n- **Reformer**: For reversible attention and locality-sensitive hashing.\n- **Compressed Attention**: For quantization and sparse representations in attention mechanisms.\n- **Hierarchical Transformer**: For multi-level memory architectures.\n\nBy synthesizing information from these areas, the researcher can make a well-informed assessment of the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal and its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in autoregressive language models.\n",

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 2.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.46)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Lookahead When It Matters: Adaptive Non-causal Transformers for Streaming Neural Transducers\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Grant P. Strimel, Yi Xie, Brian King, Martin H. Radfar, A. Rastrow, A. Mouchtaris*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT) is presented, which is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream.\n\n**Abstract:** Streaming speech recognition architectures are employed for low-latency, real-time applications. Such architectures are often characterized by their causality. Causal architectures emit tokens at each frame, relying only on current and past signal, while non-causal models are exposed to a window of future frames at each step to increase predictive accuracy. This dichotomy amounts to a trade-off for real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system design: profit from the low-latency benefit of strictly-causal architectures while accepting predictive performance limitations, or realize the modeling benefits of future-context models accompanied by their higher latency penalty. In this work, we relax the constraints of this choice and present the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT). Our architecture is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with our novel regularization algorithms, delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their causal counterparts. We showcase our design experimentally by reporting comparative ASR task results with measures of accuracy and latency on both publicly accessible and production-scale, voice-assistant datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Implicit Memory Transformer for Computationally Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Matthew Raffel, Lizhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of theart approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Abstract:** Simultaneous speech translation is an essential communication task difficult for humans whereby a translation is generated concurrently with oncoming speech inputs. For such a streaming task, transformers using block processing to break an input sequence into segments have achieved state-of-the-art performance at a reduced cost. Current methods to allow information to propagate across segments, including left context and memory banks, have faltered as they are both insufficient representations and unnecessarily expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose an Implicit Memory Transformer that implicitly retains memory through a new left context method, removing the need to explicitly represent memory with memory banks. We generate the left context from the attention output of the previous segment and include it in the keys and values of the current segment's attention calculation. Experiments on the MuST-C dataset show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of-the-art approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Hugo Touvron, M. Cord, Matthijs Douze, Francisco Massa, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Herv'e J'egou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work produces a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only and introduces a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers that relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 5590  (*Influential: 910*)\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

LayoutLMv2: Multi-modal Pre-training for Visually-Rich Document Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Lidong Zhou, Min Zhang, Wanxiang Che, Cha Zhang, Dinei Florencio, Yijuan Lu, Guoxin Wang, Furu Wei, Lei Cui, Tengchao Lv, Yiheng Xu, Yang Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-training of text and layout has proved effective in a variety of visually-rich document understanding tasks due to its effective model architecture and the advantage of large-scale unlabeled scanned/digital-born documents. We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder, LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative positional relationship among different text blocks. Experiment results show that LayoutLMv2 outperforms LayoutLM by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of downstream visually-rich document understanding tasks, including FUNSD (0.7895 $\\to$ 0.8420), CORD (0.9493 $\\to$ 0.9601), SROIE (0.9524 $\\to$ 0.9781), Kleister-NDA (0.8340 $\\to$ 0.8520), RVL-CDIP (0.9443 $\\to$ 0.9564), and DocVQA (0.7295 $\\to$ 0.8672).

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Nitesh B. Gundavarapu, Yoshua Bengio, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Kshitij Gupta, Aniket Didolkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. WeNet: Production oriented Streaming and Non-streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit\n\n*From Search Query: Streaming Attention Transformers*\n\n*Lei Xie, BinBin Zhang, Xiong Wang, Zhuoyuan Yao, Xin Lei, Fan Yu, Zhendong Peng, Xiaoyu Chen, Chao Yang, Di wu*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an open source, production first, and production ready speech recognition toolkit called WeNet in which a new two-pass approach is implemented to unify streaming and non-streaming end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition in a single model. The main motivation of WeNet is to close the gap between the research and the production of E2E speechrecognition models. WeNet provides an efficient way to ship ASR applications in several real-world scenarios, which is the main difference and advantage to other open source E2E speech recognition toolkits. In our toolkit, a new two-pass method is implemented. Our method propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy of the the transformer layers to allow arbitrary right context length modifies in hybrid CTC/attention architecture. The inference latency could be easily controlled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then rescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. Our experiments on the AISHELL-1 dataset using WeNet show that, our model achieves 5.03\\% relative character error rate (CER) reduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a standard non-streaming transformer. After model quantification, our model perform reasonable RTF and latency.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided context and external sources:\n\n### Streaming Attention Mechanisms\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss streaming attention mechanisms in transformers, the concept is crucial for handling unbounded or streaming sequences efficiently. A refined search should focus on recent papers and implementations that introduce dynamic attention computations. For example, searching for papers on \"streaming attention transformers\" or \"efficient attention mechanisms for sequence models\" could yield relevant results.\n\n### Lossless KV Cache Compression Techniques\n\n- The idea of lossless KV cache compression is critical for reducing memory and computational overhead. Although the provided sources do not cover this topic explicitly, existing research like **Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA)** could be a starting point. Searching for papers on \"lossless KV cache compression in transformers\" or \"efficient memory management in autoregressive models\" would be beneficial.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Structures\n\n- Hierarchical memory management is essential for retaining context over extended sequences while optimizing hardware utilization. This concept is somewhat related to the multi-level feature extraction seen in the GLE-Net architecture, which uses a two-branch network to extract features at different scales. However, the specific application in autoregressive models needs further investigation. Searching for \"hierarchical memory management in transformers\" or \"multi-level memory architectures in autoregressive models\" could provide relevant insights.\n\n### Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n- The integration of these modifications with existing architectures like Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and RWKV is crucial. The researcher should look into how these new components align with or differ from existing solutions. For instance, understanding how the Swin-Transformer in GLE-Net combines global and local contextual information could provide insights into integrating similar mechanisms into GAUs.\n\n### Impact on Model Performance\n\n- Evaluating the impact on performance metrics such as accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability is vital. The GLE-Net paper provides a good example of how integrating multiple modules (MFM, SIEM, and FCM) can significantly improve performance metrics like MIoU, MeanF1, and OA. Similar evaluations should be conducted for the proposed modifications in the **StreamingTTTLinear** model.\n\n### Useful References and Insights\n\n- **GLE-Net**: This paper demonstrates how combining CNN and Swin-Transformer can effectively fuse global and local contextual information, which might be analogous to the hierarchical memory management and efficient attention mechanisms needed in the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal.\n- **General Search**: Utilize databases like arXiv, Papers with Code, and Semantic Scholar to find recent papers on streaming attention, lossless KV cache compression, and hierarchical memory management in transformers.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Keywords**:\n   - Use specific keywords like \"streaming attention in transformers,\" \"lossless KV cache compression techniques,\" and \"hierarchical memory management in autoregressive models.\"\n   - Search for papers that integrate these components into GAUs or similar architectures.\n\n2. **Internal Library Search**:\n   - Perform a vector search within the internal research library focusing on foundational studies and closely related works on attention mechanisms, memory management, and efficiency improvements in transformers.\n\n3. **Analyze Findings**:\n   - Populate the analysis note sections with summaries, references, and insights from both external and internal searches to evaluate the proposal's originality and potential impact.\n   - Compare the proposed modifications with existing solutions like GLA and RWKV to assess novelty and effectiveness.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement**:\n   - Based on initial findings, refine search queries if necessary and delve deeper into specific aspects that require more investigation.\n\nBy following this structured approach, the researcher can comprehensively evaluate the **StreamingTTTLinear** proposal and gather the necessary information to advance the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/41 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.10592, 2023. ## A. Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/44 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nURL http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288. 1, 2, 6\n[39] Xiao, G., Tian, Y., Chen, B., Han, S., and Lewis, M.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models (Avg.

This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset.

The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs. A cost-effective method for KV cache compression is token dropping [25, 43, 16], which establishes an importance policy to retain significant KVs and remove insignificant ones.\n```\n\n#### 5. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention (Avg. Score: 0.50)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.
