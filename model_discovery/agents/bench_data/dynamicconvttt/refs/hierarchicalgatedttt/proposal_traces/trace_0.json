While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models.

However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/50 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn I.

Pre-training of Graph Augmented Transformers for Medication Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical graph neural networks language models*\n\n*Tengfei Ma, Cao Xiao, Junyuan Shang, Jimeng Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process. To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the medication recommendation task.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. Biomedical Event Extraction with Hierarchical Knowledge Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical graph neural networks language models*\n\n*Kung-Hsiang Huang, Nanyun Peng, Mu Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Biomedical event extraction is critical in understanding biomolecular interactions described in scientific corpus. One of the main challenges is to identify nested structured events that are associated with non-indicative trigger words. We propose to incorporate domain knowledge from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to a pre-trained language model via Graph Edge-conditioned Attention Networks (GEANet) and hierarchical graph representation. To better recognize the trigger words, each sentence is first grounded to a sentence graph based on a jointly modeled hierarchical knowledge graph from UMLS. The grounded graphs are then propagated by GEANet, a novel graph neural networks for enhanced capabilities in inferring complex events. On BioNLP 2011 GENIA Event Extraction task, our approach achieved 1.41% F1 and 3.19% F1 improvements on all events and complex events, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the importance of GEANet and hierarchical KG.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-of-the-association-for-computational\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts, a Flexible Framework for Large Language Models with Applications in Protein Mechanics and Molecular Design\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical graph neural networks language models*\n\n*Markus J. Buehler, Eric L. Buehler*\n\n**Abstract:** We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using hierarchical graph neural networks, especially in the context of language models or sequence processing, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Efficient Implementations\n- While the provided sources do not directly address efficient implementations of hierarchical graph neural networks in language models, the concept of hierarchical processing can be inferred from other domains. For instance, the hierarchical mixture of experts (MoE) approach discussed in could be adapted to language models. This method involves applying MoE at different granularities (e.g., nodes, basic blocks, and the whole graph) and aggregating them, which could help in efficient processing by specializing different experts in different regions of the representation space.\n\n## Multi-scale Processing\n- The \"HierGPT with HierarchicalRMSNorm\" design mentioned in your analysis already incorporates multi-scale processing, which is a strength of this approach. This hierarchical structure allows for better feature representation across different scales, similar to how hierarchical graph neural networks process information at multiple levels.\n\n## Dynamic Routing Between Scales\n- The idea of dynamic routing between scales can be inspired by the gating mechanisms in the \"GatedTTTLinear\" design. By integrating these gating mechanisms into a hierarchical structure, you can dynamically control the flow of information between different scales. This approach is not explicitly covered in the provided sources but can be inferred by combining the concepts from your analysis. For example, using attention mechanisms like those in Graph Attention Networks (GAT) could help in dynamically assigning weights to different scales or nodes, thus focusing on the most relevant information during aggregation.\n\n## Applications to Transformer or Attention Architectures\n- To integrate hierarchical graph neural networks into transformer or attention architectures, you can consider the following:\n  - **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: These networks use attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant information during aggregation. This can be adapted to transformer architectures to enhance the capture of complex relationships within sequence data.\n  - **Hierarchical Processing**: The hierarchical mixture of experts (MoE) approach can be integrated into transformer models to allow different experts to specialize in different regions of the representation space. This can enhance the model's ability to capture multi-scale information and improve efficiency.\n\n### Future Directions\n- Investigate how to combine the strengths of hierarchical processing and dynamic gating mechanisms to create a more efficient and adaptive language model. This could involve:\n  - Using hierarchical graph neural networks to structure the global dependencies in a way that reduces computational overhead.\n  - Implementing dynamic routing mechanisms to control the flow of information between different scales, potentially using attention or gating mechanisms.\n  - Exploring multi-scale attention mechanisms that can efficiently capture and process information at various levels of granularity.\n\nBy combining these concepts, you can develop a novel autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of hierarchical graph neural networks, efficient multi-scale processing, and dynamic routing mechanisms, ultimately improving the model's performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We also show that combining global-local attention with relative position encodings and a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) pre-training objective allows ETC to encode structured inputs.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/48 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nJayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient multi-scale attention mechanisms sequence models*\n\n*Yifei Xiao, Junhui Chen, Jince Wang, Feihu Huang, Jian Peng, Huiqiang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2023-2\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient multi-scale attention mechanisms sequence models*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Gated Attention Coding for Training High-performance and Efficient Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient multi-scale attention mechanisms sequence models*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Liang-Jian Deng, Zhaorui Wang, Yuhong Chou, Rui-Jie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences. However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision. Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a plug-and-play module that leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN architecture. GAC functions as a preprocessing layer that does not disrupt the spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by 3.10\\% on CIFAR100 with only 6-time steps and 1.07\\% on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to 66.9\\% of the previous works. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to explore the attention-based dynamic coding scheme in deep SNNs, with exceptional effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.The Code is available at https://github.com/bollossom/GAC.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on efficient multi-scale attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Efficient Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Tensorized Attention\nThe paper on \"Long Sequence Modeling with Attention Tensorization\" introduces a method that efficiently extends the context length of attention-based models.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 4. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n#### 5. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 0 related papers from 0 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: divide-and-conquer attention mechanisms efficient implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using efficient implementations of divide-and-conquer approaches in attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Computational Optimization\n\n- The **Carrying Over Algorithm (COA)** in transformers is particularly relevant as it optimizes attention mechanisms by reusing computations from previous time steps, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency when processing long sequences. This approach helps in managing the flow of information across layers, preserving context, and optimizing attention mechanisms, which is crucial for memory and computational efficiency.\n\n## Combining Local and Global Processing\n\n- **CHELA** and **Lightning Attention-2** provide valuable insights into combining local and global processing efficiently. CHELA uses short-long convolutions with hardware-efficient linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, allowing for global abstraction and data-dependent selection while maintaining linear complexity. Lightning Attention-2 employs a tiling strategy to handle both local and global dependencies efficiently, utilizing conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Tiling Strategies\n\n- **Hierarchical processing** can be achieved by combining local processing with global processing using tiling strategies. This approach is highlighted in both CHELA and Lightning Attention-2, where tiling techniques are used to efficiently handle different scales and take full advantage of GPU hardware. This method ensures that both local and global dependencies are handled efficiently.\n\n## Maintaining Causality\n\n- **Sparse Flash Attention** demonstrates how to implement sparse attention patterns without computational overhead, which is crucial for maintaining causality in autoregressive models. By extending FlashAttention to accommodate various attention sparsity patterns, this method ensures that long-range dependencies are captured efficiently while maintaining causality through careful attention pattern design.\n\n## Structured Information Protocol and Confidence Calibration\n\n- The **LLM\u00d7MapReduce** framework introduces a structured information protocol to address inter-chunk dependencies and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism to resolve inter-chunk conflicts. This framework is designed to process long texts efficiently by splitting the document into chunks and aggregating the intermediate answers. The structured information protocol ensures that critical inputs are conveyed between stages, which can be adapted to maintain context and causality in autoregressive models.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n- **Lightning Attention-2** and **CHELA** both emphasize hardware-aware implementations. Lightning Attention-2 uses tiling techniques to optimize for GPU hardware, while CHELA implements linear attention in a way that is hardware-efficient. These approaches are essential for optimizing the hardware utilization of the model.\n\nBy integrating these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is efficient in terms of memory and computation, capable of combining local and global processing, and maintains causality while leveraging hardware efficiently.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Liu, Z., Li, S., Wang, L., Wang, Z., Liu, Y., & Li, S.

Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing (Avg. Score: 0.32)\n\n*Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 199  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Funnel-Transformer, a model which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost and outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/94 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nJournal of artificial intelligence research, 22:457-479, 2004. [26] Y. Fang, S. Sun, Z.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/31 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn Sanmi Koyejo, S.

Score: 0.03)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

The \"Sparse Flash Attention\" method, though not directly mentioned in the provided sources, is analogous to techniques discussed in graph neural networks. For instance, the TVGeAN model uses sparse learning units to prioritize nodes and edges based on their importance, which can be adapted for sparse attention patterns in autoregressive models.\n\n## Dynamic Information Flow Between Hierarchical Levels\n- Hierarchical graph neural networks can benefit from dynamic routing mechanisms similar to those used in other contexts. The Ladderpath approach, which characterizes hierarchical and nested relationships, can be insightful. It suggests that networks perform best when they exhibit the richest hierarchical structure, which could be applied to dynamic routing between hierarchical levels in graph neural networks.\n\n## Combining Local and Global Graph Processing\n- Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are prominent architectures that can be adapted for combining local and global processing. GAT introduces attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant information, while GCN aggregates information from immediate neighbors. These can be integrated into a hierarchical framework to handle both local and global context efficiently.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n- For hardware-efficient implementations, techniques such as matrix decomposition and kernel fusion, as mentioned in the context of FlashFFTConv, can be applied. Additionally, tiling strategies and hardware-aware implementations, as seen in Lightning Attention-2, can reduce I/O and maintain efficiency while preserving global context[3,.\n\n### Specific Techniques and Methods\n\n- **Dynamic Graph Neural Networks**: The TVGeAN model, which uses a Tensor Visibility Graph (TVG) algorithm to transform multivariate time series into graphs, demonstrates dynamic information flow. This approach can be adapted for hierarchical graph neural networks to handle dynamic routing between scales.\n\n- **Efficient Sparse Graph Operations**: The use of sparse learning units in TVGeAN and the concept of sparse attention patterns can be integrated into hierarchical graph neural networks to maintain efficiency while preserving expressiveness.\n\n- **Combining Local and Global Processing**: The Graph-enhanced Attention Network (GeAN) in TVGeAN seamlessly integrates temporal interactions and mutual relationships, providing a comprehensive representation. This can be applied to combine local and global graph processing in hierarchical models.\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: The strategies mentioned in the context of FlashFFTConv and Lightning Attention-2, such as matrix decomposition, kernel fusion, and tiling, can be adapted for hardware-efficient implementations of hierarchical graph neural networks.\n\n### Future Search Directions\n\n- Investigate papers that specifically focus on hierarchical graph neural networks with dynamic routing mechanisms, such as the work on differentiable graph pooling methods and hierarchical representations in graph neural networks.\n- Explore methods for efficient sparse graph operations, such as those used in sparse attention mechanisms and sparse learning units.\n- Research techniques for combining local and global processing in graph networks, including the use of attention mechanisms and hierarchical architectures.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop hierarchical graph neural networks with dynamic routing mechanisms that are efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware, ultimately improving the performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

GhostNetV2: Enhance Cheap Operation with Long-Range Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chao Xu, Chang Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Kai Han, Yehui Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specially designed for applications on mobile devices with faster inference speed. The convolutional operation can only capture local information in a window region, which prevents performance from being further improved. Introducing self-attention into convolution can capture global information well, but it will largely encumber the actual speed. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly attention mechanism (dubbed DFC attention) and then present a new GhostNetV2 architecture for mobile applications. The proposed DFC attention is constructed based on fully-connected layers, which can not only execute fast on common hardware but also capture the dependence between long-range pixels. We further revisit the expressiveness bottleneck in previous GhostNet and propose to enhance expanded features produced by cheap operations with DFC attention, so that a GhostNetV2 block can aggregate local and long-range information simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GhostNetV2 over existing architectures. For example, it achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 167M FLOPs, significantly suppressing GhostNetV1 (74.5%) with a similar computational cost.

Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jian Ren, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Kamyar Salahi, Georgios Evangelidis, Yang Wen, Ju Hu, Yanyu Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. This work demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance even with MobileNet-level size and speed.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. OLLA: Optimizing the Lifetime and Location of Arrays to Reduce the Memory Usage of Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization neural networks*\n\n*James Hegarty, Jacob Kahn, Mostafa Elhoushi, Benoit Steiner*\n\n**Abstract:** The size of deep neural networks has grown exponentially in recent years. Unfortunately, hardware devices have not kept pace with the rapidly increasing memory requirements. To cope with this, researchers have turned to techniques such as spilling and recomputation, which increase training time, or reduced precision and model pruning, which can affect model accuracy. We present OLLA, an algorithm that optimizes the lifetime and memory location of the tensors used to train neural networks. Our method reduces the memory usage of existing neural networks, without needing any modification to the models or their training procedures. We formulate the problem as a joint integer linear program (ILP). We present several techniques to simplify the encoding of the problem, and enable our approach to scale to the size of state-of-the-art neural networks using an off-the-shelf ILP solver. We experimentally demonstrate that OLLA only takes minutes if not seconds to allow the training of neural networks using one-third less memory on average.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-24\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, the poor efficiency of GNN inference and frequent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problem limit the successful application of GNN on edge computing platforms. To tackle these problems, a feature decomposition approach is proposed for memory efficiency optimization of GNN inference. The proposed approach could achieve outstanding optimization on various GNN models, covering a wide range of datasets, which speeds up the inference by up to 3x. Furthermore, the proposed feature decomposition could significantly reduce the peak memory usage (up to 5x in memory efficiency improvement) and mitigate OOM problems during GNN inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. Selecting Informative Contexts Improves Language Model Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time training*\n\n*Nicole Beckage, Richard Antonello, Javier Turek, Alexander Huth*\n\n**Abstract:** Language model fine-tuning is essential for modern natural language processing, but is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Further, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples that negatively affect performance. Here we present a general fine-tuning method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a test metric after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm for language model fine-tuning -- we encourage researchers to release pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and effective fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance and reducing the overall energy footprint of language model fine-tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 6.

We present a large-scale life-long memory module for\nuse in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for\nefficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the\nnearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained\nend-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e.,\nwithout the need to reset it during training.\n  Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural\nnetwork. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple\nconvolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence\nand recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains\nthe ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module\nremembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it\ncan successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot\nlearning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long\none-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine\ntranslation task.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware-efficient attention mechanisms, memory optimization, and test-time training efficiency, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### IO-Aware Implementations and Memory Hierarchy Optimization\n- The paper on \"Long Sequence Modeling with Attention Tensorization\" discusses the use of tensorized attention, which is compatible with sparse attention mechanisms and can extend the context window efficiently. It highlights the use of blockwise attention calculation, similar to FlashAttention, but with improved running times and memory usage for longer sequences.\n- The concept of FlashAttention is reiterated in the analysis note, emphasizing its IO-aware algorithm that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes and is crucial for memory efficiency.\n\n### Efficient Computation Patterns\n- The \"Local Attention Mechanism\" (LAM) paper introduces an attention mechanism that computes dot products only on nearby inputs, leading to almost linear time and memory complexity. This mechanism is implemented efficiently in tensor algebra, which can be beneficial for long sequences and hardware-constrained settings.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Neural Networks\n\n### Cache-Friendly Architectures and Efficient Data Movement\n- The analysis note mentions the importance of tiling and blocking strategies for efficient cache utilization, as seen in FlashAttention and Ring Attention. These strategies help in reducing I/O and improving memory efficiency by overlapping computation and communication.\n- The \"Long Sequence Modeling with Attention Tensorization\" paper also discusses the use of tensorized attention, which maintains low memory usage similar to FlashAttention while achieving lower running times for longer sequences.\n\n### Dynamic Memory Management\n- The concept of dynamic compression techniques for memory optimization is highlighted in the analysis note through the MoA (Mixture of Sparse Attention) reference. MoA uses sparse attention patterns and dynamic compression to optimize memory usage, which is crucial for large language models.\n\n## Test-Time Training Efficiency\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimization and Memory-Efficient Adaptation\n- For test-time training in hardware-constrained settings, the use of efficient attention mechanisms like FlashAttention and tensorized attention can be pivotal. These mechanisms are designed to be IO-aware and optimize memory usage, which is essential for efficient adaptation during test-time training.\n- The \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" paper introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing, which significantly improves efficiency with low power consumption and latency. This approach could be explored for optimizing test-time training in resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Resource-Constrained Training\n- The memristor-based accelerator also demonstrates how matrix operations can be performed efficiently using analog methods, reducing the need for intermediate results and data dependencies. This can be particularly useful for resource-constrained training scenarios where both power and latency are critical.\n\nIn summary, the key strategies to improve autoregressive language model design include:\n\n- **Tensorized attention** and **FlashAttention** for efficient and IO-aware attention mechanisms.\n- **Local Attention Mechanism (LAM)** for linear time and memory complexity.\n- **Tiling and blocking** for cache-friendly architectures and efficient data movement.\n- **Dynamic compression and sparse attention** for memory optimization.\n- **Memristor-based accelerators** for hardware-aware optimization and resource-constrained training.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving better performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/62 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nSee https://vicuna.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Zero-shot Entity Linking with Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training language models*\n\n*L Venkata Subramaniam, Alexander Gray, Salim Roukos, Pavan Kapanipathi, Dinesh Garg, Saswati Dana, Dinesh Khandelwal, G P Shrivatsa Bhargav*\n\n**Abstract:** Entity Linking (EL) maps an entity mention in a natural language sentence to an entity in a knowledge base (KB). The Zero-shot Entity Linking (ZEL) extends the scope of EL to unseen entities at the test time without requiring new labeled data. BLINK (BERT-based) is one of the SOTA models for ZEL. Interestingly, we discovered that BLINK exhibits diminishing returns, i.e., it reaches 98% of its performance with just 1% of the training data and the remaining 99% of the data yields only a marginal increase of 2% in the performance. While this extra 2% gain makes a huge difference for downstream tasks, training BLINK on large amounts of data is very resource-intensive and impractical. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic, multi-task learning approach to bridge this gap. Our approach boosts the BLINK\u2019s performance with much less data by exploiting an auxiliary information about entity types. Specifically, we train our model on two tasks simultaneously - entity linking (primary task) and hierarchical entity type prediction (auxiliary task). The auxiliary task exploits the hierarchical structure of entity types. Our approach achieves superior performance on ZEL task with significantly less training data. On four different benchmark datasets, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than SOTA models when they are trained with just 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1% of the original training data.

YourMT3+: Multi-instrument Music Transcription with Enhanced Transformer Architectures and Cross-dataset Stem Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training language models*\n\n*Simon Dixon, Holger Kirchhoff, Emmanouil Benetos, Sungkyun Chang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-instrument music transcription aims to convert polyphonic music recordings into musical scores assigned to each instrument. This task is challenging for modeling as it requires simultaneously identifying multiple instruments and transcribing their pitch and precise timing, and the lack of fully annotated data adds to the training difficulties. This paper introduces YourMT3+, a suite of models for enhanced multi-instrument music transcription based on the recent language token decoding approach of MT3. We enhance its encoder by adopting a hierarchical attention transformer in the time-frequency domain and integrating a mixture of experts. To address data limitations, we introduce a new multi-channel decoding method for training with incomplete annotations and propose intra- and cross-stem augmentation for dataset mixing. Our experiments demonstrate direct vocal transcription capabilities, eliminating the need for voice separation pre-processors. Benchmarks across ten public datasets show our models' competitiveness with, or superiority to, existing transcription models. Further testing on pop music recordings highlights the limitations of current models.

Chi, Lichan Hong, Rahul Mazumder, Yihua Chen, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Aakanksha Chowdhery, Zhe Zhao, Hussein Hazimeh*\n\n**Abstract:** The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth. The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates.

Modeling Task Relationships in Multi-task Learning with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale gated neural networks*\n\n*Ed Chi, Lichan Hong, Jilin Chen, Xinyang Yi, Zhe Zhao, Jiaqi Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural-based multi-task learning has been successfully used in many real-world large-scale applications such as recommendation systems. For example, in movie recommendations, beyond providing users movies which they tend to purchase and watch, the system might also optimize for users liking the movies afterwards. With multi-task learning, we aim to build a single model that learns these multiple goals and tasks simultaneously. However, the prediction quality of commonly used multi task models is often sensitive to the relationships between tasks. It is therefore important to study the modeling tradeoffs between task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE), which explicitly learns to model task relationships from data. We adapt the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a gating network trained to optimize each task. To validate our approach on data with different levels of task relatedness, we first apply it to a synthetic dataset where we control the task relatedness. We show that the proposed approach performs better than baseline methods when the tasks are less related. We also show that the MMoE structure results in an additional trainability benefit, depending on different levels of randomness in the training data and model initialization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance improvements by MMoE on real tasks including a binary classification benchmark, and a large-scale content recommendation system at Google.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-19\n\n\n\n#### 5. SpeechFormer++: A Hierarchical Efficient Framework for Paralinguistic Speech Processing\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hierarchical processing*\n\n*Lan Du, Jianxin Pang, Xiangmin Xu, Xiaofen Xing, Weidong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Paralinguistic speech processing is important in addressing many issues, such as sentiment and neurocognitive disorder analyses. Recently, Transformer has achieved remarkable success in the natural language processing field and has demonstrated its adaptation to speech. However, previous works on Transformer in the speech field have not incorporated the properties of speech, leaving the full potential of Transformer unexplored. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of speech and propose a general structure-based framework, called SpeechFormer++, for paralinguistic speech processing. More concretely, following the component relationship in the speech signal, we design a unit encoder to model the intra- and inter-unit information (i.e., frames, phones, and words) efficiently. According to the hierarchical relationship, we utilize merging blocks to generate features at different granularities, which is consistent with the structural pattern in the speech signal. Moreover, a word encoder is introduced to integrate word-grained features into each unit encoder, which effectively balances fine-grained and coarse-grained information. SpeechFormer++ is evaluated on the speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP & MELD), depression classification (DAIC-WOZ) and Alzheimer's disease detection (Pitt) tasks. The results show that SpeechFormer++ outperforms the standard Transformer while greatly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, it delivers superior results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficient Sparse Coding using Hierarchical Riemannian Pursuit\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hierarchical processing*\n\n*Songfu Cai, Vincent Lau, Ye Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However, classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hierarchical processing, multi-scale architectures, efficient implementation, and gating mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing in Language Models\n\n### Multi-Scale Architectures\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-demonstrated in models like the Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HVT), although it is primarily applied in computer vision. However, the principles of multi-scale feature extraction and hierarchical alignment can be adapted to language models. The HVT architecture processes input through multiple layers, each focusing on different scales, which could be a valuable inspiration for language models.\n\n### Efficient Implementation and Memory Optimization\n- The EMMA model (Empowering Multi-modal Mamba with Structural and Hierarchical Alignment) provides insights into efficient hierarchical processing. EMMA uses a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module to combine visual features from intermediate layers, which could be analogous to combining linguistic features at different scales in language models. This approach enhances cross-modal alignment and reduces latency, suggesting potential for similar efficiency gains in language models.\n\n## Test-Time Training Approaches\n\n### Hierarchical or Multi-Scale Processing\n- While the papers reviewed do not specifically discuss test-time training in the context of language models, the concept of hierarchical feature encoding in models like HiTime (Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs with Semantic Space Alignment) can be relevant. HiTime integrates temporal features into LLMs using a hierarchical feature encoder, which aligns well with the idea of hierarchical processing during test-time training. This approach ensures that the model captures both local and global features, which could be adapted for language models handling long sequences.\n\n### Efficient Parameter Updates\n- The efficiency in parameter updates can be inferred from the EMMA model, which achieves lower latency and faster inference compared to transformer-based models. The use of pixel-wise alignment and multi-scale feature fusion modules suggests that similar techniques could be applied to language models to optimize parameter updates during test-time training.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n\n### Multi-Scale Architectures and Adaptive Processing\n- Gating mechanisms are not explicitly discussed in the reviewed papers, but the concept of hierarchical and multi-scale processing can imply the use of adaptive mechanisms to control the flow of information across different scales. The Ladderpath approach, which characterizes hierarchical structures in neural networks, suggests that networks with optimal structural complexity (measured by the order-rate \u03b7) exhibit superior performance. This could imply that gating mechanisms, if integrated to control the flow of information within a hierarchical structure, could enhance performance and efficiency.\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Designs\n- The HiTime model's use of a dual-view contrastive alignment module to bridge the gap between temporal feature space and the LLM\u2019s semantic space can be seen as a form of adaptive processing. This module ensures semantic alignment, which is crucial for parameter-efficient designs. Similar alignment mechanisms could be used in language models to ensure that gating mechanisms are parameter-efficient and effective across different scales.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hierarchical Swarm Architectures**: While not directly related to language models, the concept of hierarchical swarm architectures can provide insights into how tasks can be distributed and coordinated efficiently in a hierarchical structure. This could inspire novel ways to organize and process information in hierarchical language models.\n\nIn summary, the EMMA and HiTime models offer valuable insights into hierarchical and multi-scale processing, efficient implementation, and adaptive mechanisms that can be adapted to improve autoregressive language model design. The Ladderpath approach provides a theoretical framework for understanding the importance of hierarchical structures in neural networks, which can guide the design of gating mechanisms and hierarchical processing in language models.\n",

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 255  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale and enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

ProxylessNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search on Target Task and Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization neural networks*\n\n*Song Han, Ligeng Zhu, Han Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) has a great impact by automatically\ndesigning effective neural network architectures. However, the prohibitive\ncomputational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. $10^4$ GPU hours)\nmakes it difficult to \\emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale\ntasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via\na continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high\nGPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a\nresult, they need to utilize~\\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller\ndataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs.\nThese architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal\non the target task. In this paper, we present \\emph{ProxylessNAS} that can\n\\emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target\nhardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of\ndifferentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory)\nto the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate\nset. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of\ndirectness and specialization. On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08\\% test\nerror with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art\narchitecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6$\\times$ fewer parameters. On ImageNet,\nour model achieves 3.1\\% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being\n1.2$\\times$ faster with measured GPU latency. We also apply ProxylessNAS to\nspecialize neural architectures for hardware with direct hardware metrics (e.g.\nlatency) and provide insights for efficient CNN architecture design.\n\n**Conference:** proxylessnas-direct-neural-architecture-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms sequence models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. TransNormerLLM: A Faster and Better Large Language Model with Improved TransNormer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms sequence models*\n\n*Yu Qiao, Xiao Luo, Yiran Zhong, Baohong Lv, Yunshen Wei, Xiaodong Han, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** We present TransNormerLLM, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

CrossViT: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient multi-scale processing*\n\n*Rameswar Panda, Quanfu Fan, Chun-Fu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently developed vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on image classification compared to convolutional neural networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to combine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2\\% with a small to moderate increase in FLOPs and model parameters.

AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient multi-scale processing*\n\n*Song Han, Xingyu Dang, Guangxuan Xiao, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Chuang Gan, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Jiaming Tang, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on test-time training optimization, efficient gating mechanisms, and memory optimization for multi-scale models, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Test-Time Training Optimization\n\n### Parameter Update Efficiency\n- Test-Time Training (TTT) and Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are crucial for adapting models to new data distributions efficiently. For instance, the \"Meet-In-The-Middle based Test-Time Adaptation\" (MITA) method uses energy-based optimization to adapt the model and data mutually, which can be more efficient than traditional batch-level TTA methods.\n- Another approach involves using self-supervised objectives during test-time training. This method fine-tunes the model for each test sample based on a self-supervised loss function, which helps in adapting to unseen data efficiently.\n\n### Memory Management\n- Efficient memory management during test-time training can be achieved by optimizing the model's parameters and statistics. For example, recalculating the BatchNorm statistics from the test samples or optimizing the affine parameters in BatchNorm layers can help in adapting the model to the test domain without significant memory overhead.\n\n### Adaptation Strategies\n- Test-time training can be enhanced by using auxiliary heads for self-supervised learning tasks. This approach allows the model to adapt to out-of-distribution test data by fine-tuning the encoder based on the self-supervised objective function.\n\n## Efficient Gating Mechanisms in Sequence Models\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Designs\n- Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (HGRNNs) introduce effective hierarchical gating mechanisms that are parameter-efficient. These mechanisms help in reducing computational complexity and improving the model's performance.\n- State Space Models (SSMs) with dense hidden connections, such as DenseMamba, also incorporate efficient gating mechanisms that simulate attention mechanisms using fewer parameters and computations [Reference from Analysis Note].\n\n### Dynamic Routing\n- Dynamic routing in hierarchical models can be achieved through the use of gating mechanisms that selectively route information through different scales or layers. This is seen in hierarchical architectures where gates control the flow of information, ensuring that only relevant information is processed at each scale.\n\n### Scale-Specific Gating\n- Scale-specific gating involves using different gating mechanisms at different scales or layers of the model. For example, in hierarchical models, gates can be designed to operate at specific scales, ensuring that the model captures both local and global context efficiently [Reference from Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Optimization for Multi-Scale Models\n\n### Efficient Feature Representation\n- Efficient feature representation can be achieved through sparse operations and MatMul-free architectures. For instance, the \"Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\" approach eliminates MatMul operations, reducing memory usage by up to 61% during training [Reference from Analysis Note].\n- Using State Space Models (SSMs) with efficient projections and fast Fourier transform (FFT) can also reduce computation and memory consumption further [Reference from Analysis Note].\n\n### Cache Management\n- Cache management is crucial for multi-scale models. Implementing hardware-aware optimizations and ensuring that the model's architecture is aligned with the memory hierarchy can significantly improve performance. For example, using hierarchical processing can reduce the need for frequent memory accesses, thus optimizing cache usage [Reference from Analysis Note].\n\n### Sparse Computation Techniques\n- Sparse computation techniques are effective in reducing memory usage and computational complexity. Methods like sparse attention mechanisms and sparse linear algebra operations can be integrated into multi-scale models to achieve better memory efficiency [Reference from Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that is optimized for test-time training, features efficient gating mechanisms, and is memory-efficient for multi-scale processing.\n",

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

PanGu-\u03c0: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation (Avg.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

SIDE-real: Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with truncated marginal neural ratio estimation applied to real data\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Dynamic DNNs and Runtime Management for Efficient Inference on Mobile/Embedded Devices\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient hierarchical neural networks*\n\n*Geoff V. Merrett, Jonathon Hare, Lei Xun*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural network (DNN) inference is increasingly being executed on mobile and embedded platforms due to several key advantages in latency, privacy and always-on availability. However, due to limited computing resources, efficient DNN deployment on mobile and embedded platforms is challenging. Although many hardware accelerators and static model compression methods were proposed by previous works, at system runtime, multiple applications are typically executed concurrently and compete for hardware resources. This raises two main challenges: Runtime Hardware Availability and Runtime Application Variability. Previous works have addressed these challenges through either dynamic neural networks that contain sub-networks with different performance trade-offs or runtime hardware resource management. In this thesis, we proposed a combined method, a system was developed for DNN performance trade-off management, combining the runtime trade-off opportunities in both algorithms and hardware to meet dynamically changing application performance targets and hardware constraints in real time. We co-designed novel Dynamic Super-Networks to maximise runtime system-level performance and energy efficiency on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Compared with SOTA, our experimental results using ImageNet on the GPU of Jetson Xavier NX show our model is 2.4x faster for similar ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, or 5.1% higher accuracy at similar latency. We also designed a hierarchical runtime resource manager that tunes both dynamic neural networks and DVFS at runtime. Compared with the Linux DVFS governor schedutil, our runtime approach achieves up to a 19% energy reduction and a 9% latency reduction in single model deployment scenario, and an 89% energy reduction and a 23% latency reduction in a two concurrent model deployment scenario.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?\n\n*From Search Query: sparse operations multi-scale models*\n\n*Yi Ma, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Yuexiang Zhai, Hao Bai, Shengbang Tong, Ziyang Wu, Tianzhe Chu, Druv Pai, Sam Buchanan, Yaodong Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: sparse operations multi-scale models*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. mlpack 3: a fast, flexible machine learning library\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization techniques*\n\n*Shangtong Zhang, Ryan R. Curtin, Marcus Edel, Mikhail Lozhnikov, Yannis Mentekidis, Sumedh Ghaisas*\n\n**Abstract:** In the past several years, the field of machine learning has seen an explosion of interest and excitement, with hundreds or thousands of algorithms developed for different tasks every year. But a primary problem faced by the field is the ability to scale to larger and larger data -- since it is known that training on larger datasets typically produces better results. Therefore, the development of new algorithms for the continued growth of the field depends largely on the existence of good tooling and libraries that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly prototype and develop solutions. Simultaneously, useful libraries must also be efficient and well-implemented. This has motivated our development of mlpack. mlpack is a flexible and fast machine learning library written in C++ that has bindings that allow use from the command-line and from Python, with support for other languages in active development. mlpack has been developed actively for over 10 years, with over 100 contributors from around the world, and is a frequent mentoring organization in the Google Summer of Code program. If used in C++, the library allows flexibility with no speed penalty through policy-based design and template metaprogramming; but bindings are available to other languages, which allow easy use of the fast mlpack codebase. For fast linear algebra, mlpack is built on the Armadillo C++ matrix library, which in turn can use an optimized BLAS implementation such as OpenBLAS or even NVBLAS which would allow mlpack algorithms to be run on the GPU. In order to provide fast code, template metaprogramming is used throughout the library to reduce runtime overhead by performing any possible computations and optimizations at compile time. An automatic benchmarking system is developed and used to test the efficiency of mlpack's algorithms. mlpack contains a number of standard machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and k-means clustering, and also contains cutting-edge techniques such as a compile-time optimized deep learning and reinforcement learning framework, dual-tree algorithms for nearest neighbor search and other tasks, a generic optimization framework with numerous optimizers, a generic hyper-parameter tuner, and other recently published machine learning algorithms.

HyperMorph: Amortized Hyperparameter Learning for Image Registration\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training optimization techniques*\n\n*Adrian V. Dalca, John Guttag, Bruce Fischl, Malte Hoffmann, Andrew Hoopes*\n\n**Abstract:** We present HyperMorph, a learning-based strategy for deformable image registration that removes the need to tune important registration hyperparameters during training. Classical registration methods solve an optimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two images, while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a function that generates these correspondences. The quality of the results for both types of techniques depends greatly on the choice of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically involves training many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially leading to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce amortized hyperparameter learning for image registration, a novel strategy to learn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation fields. The proposed framework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and modulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for that hyperparameter value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model that enables rapid, fine-grained discovery of hyperparameter values from a continuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search strategies, leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as increased flexibility. We also show several important benefits, including increased robustness to initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a registration task, dataset, or even a single anatomical region, all without retraining the HyperMorph model. Our code is publicly available at http://voxelmorph.mit.edu.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware efficiency, hierarchical models, sparse operations, and test-time training optimization, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Models\n\n### Memory Access Patterns and Computation Optimization\n- The paper on reducing data bottlenecks in distributed, heterogeneous neural networks highlights the importance of optimizing bottleneck layers to reduce data traffic and improve computational efficiency. This is achieved by using extremely narrow layers and learnable embeddings, which can be applied to hierarchical models to optimize memory access patterns and computation.\n- The concept of using blockwise computation, as seen in Ring Attention, can be integrated into hierarchical models to handle long sequences efficiently. This approach can reduce memory overhead and improve computation optimization[Analysis Note].\n\n### Cache Utilization\n- Hardware-aware neural network design, such as the one discussed in the context of embedded multicore and many-core systems, emphasizes the importance of cache utilization. By designing bottleneck layers that reduce inter-chip communication overhead, similar strategies can be applied to hierarchical models to improve cache utilization.\n\n## Sparse Operations in Multi-Scale Architectures\n\n### Dynamic Sparsity and Efficient Sparse Computation\n- The use of sparse operations can be optimized through dynamic sparsity, where the sparsity pattern is learned during training. This approach can be integrated into multi-scale architectures to reduce computational and memory costs. For example, sparsely activated models can reduce data movement throughout the network, which is beneficial for resource-constrained environments.\n- Efficient sparse computation can be achieved by employing techniques such as those used in binary neural networks (BNNs), where the focus is on reducing the number of parameters and Multiply\u2013Accumulate operations (MACs). This can be adapted to multi-scale models to enhance efficiency.\n\n### Memory Management\n- Memory management in sparse operations can be improved by using techniques like the ones proposed for BNNs, where the input layer is quantized using methods such as stochastic computing or binary-coded decimal (BCD) encoding. However, these methods need to be carefully adapted to avoid degradation in accuracy.\n- The integration of sparse operations with gating mechanisms, as suggested in the analysis note, can help in managing memory efficiently by selectively activating parts of the network based on the input[Analysis Note].\n\n## Test-Time Optimization Techniques\n\n### Parameter Update Strategies and Memory-Efficient Adaptation\n- Test-time training optimization can be enhanced using parameter update strategies that are memory-efficient. For instance, protecting only salient weights, as demonstrated in AWQ, can reduce quantization error and memory usage during test-time adaptation[Analysis Note].\n- Gating mechanisms, such as those introduced in Mega and TransNormerLLM, can be used to update parameters efficiently during test time. These mechanisms can incorporate inductive bias and smooth training, leading to better performance with reduced memory overhead[Analysis Note].\n\n### Dynamic Optimization Methods\n- Dynamic optimization methods can be applied during test time by leveraging techniques like moving averages to incorporate position-aware local dependencies. This approach, as seen in Mega, can provide efficient position-aware processing without significant additional computational cost[Analysis Note].\n- The use of learnable embeddings to reduce data traffic, as discussed in the context of reducing data bottlenecks, can also be applied to dynamic optimization methods during test time. This helps in minimizing the demands on chip IOs and improving overall efficiency.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers can:\n- Optimize hierarchical models using blockwise computation and bottleneck layers to reduce memory access and computation costs.\n- Integrate dynamic sparsity and efficient sparse computation into multi-scale architectures.\n- Employ gating mechanisms and selective weight protection to manage memory efficiently during test-time optimization.\n- Use learnable embeddings and dynamic optimization methods to minimize data traffic and improve overall efficiency.\n",
