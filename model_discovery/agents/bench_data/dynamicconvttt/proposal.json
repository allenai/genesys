We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 7871-7880, Online, July 2020.

On the WMT' 14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere has been much recent progress in sequence modeling through recurrent neural networks (RNN; Sutskever et al. 2014, Bahdanau et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016), convolutional networks (CNN; Kalchbrenner et al. 2016; Gehring et al. 2016; 2017; Kaiser et al. 2017) and self-attention models (Paulus et al.||2017; Vaswani et al.||2017). RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(2018). Table 3 shows that our models outperform this approach. Note that AANs still use self-attention in the encoder network while as our approach does away with self-attention both in the encoder and decoder. ### 6.3 LANGUAGE MODELING\n\nAs second task we consider language modeling on the Billion word benchmark. The self-attention baseline has $N=16$ blocks, each with a self-attention module and a feed-forward module using $d_{f f}=4096$ and $d=1024$. DynamicConv uses $N=17$ blocks to assimilate the parameter count and we use kernel sizes $15 \\times 2,31 \\times 4$ and $63 \\times 11$. Table 4 shows that DynamicConv achieves slightly better perplexity than our self-attention baseline which is very competitive. | Model | Param | Valid | Test |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 2-layer LSTM-8192-1024 (J\u00f3zefowicz et al. 2016) | - | - | 30.6 |\n| Gated Convolutional Model (Dauphin et al. 2017) | 428 M | - | 31.9 |\n| Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017) | $4371 \\mathrm{M}^{\\dagger}$ | - | 28.0 |\n| Self-attention baseline | 331 M | 26.67 | 26.73 |\n| DynamicConv | 339 M | 26.60 | 26.67 |\n\nTable 4: Language modeling results on the Google Billion Word test set. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ does not include embedding and softmax layers\n\n| Model | Param | Rouge-1 | Rouge-2 | Rouge-1 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| LSTM Paulus et al. 2017) | - | 38.30 | 14.81 | 35.49 |\n| CNN (Fan et al. 2017) | - | 39.06 | 15.38 | 35.77 |\n| Self-attention baseline | 90M | 39.26 | 15.98 | 36.35 |\n| LightConv | 86 M | 39.52 | 15.97 | 36.51 |\n| DynamicConv | 87M | 39.84 | 16.25 | 36.73 |\n| RL (Celikyilmaz et al., 2018) | - | 41.69 | 19.47 | 37.92 |\n\nTable 5: Results on CNN-DailyMail summarization. We compare to likelihood trained approaches except for Celikyilmaz et al. (2018). ### 6.4 Abstractive SUMMARIZATION\n\nFinally, we evaluate on the CNN-DailyMail abstractive document summarization benchmark where we encode a document of up to 400 words and generate multi-sentence summaries. This tests the ability of our model to deal with longer sequences. We reduce model capacity by setting $d=1024$, $d_{f f}=2048, H=8$, similar to the Transformer base setup of Vaswani et al. (2017). Table 5 shows that LightConv outperforms the self-attention baseline as well as comparable previous work and DynamicConv performs even better. We also show results for a reinforcement learning approach (Celikyilmaz et al. 2018) and note that RL is equally applicable to our architecture 8\n\n## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe presented lightweight convolutions which perform competitively to the best reported results in the literature despite their simplicity. They have a very small parameter footprint and the kernel does not change over time-steps. This demonstrates that self-attention is not critical to achieve good accuracy on the language tasks we considered. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different kernel at every time-step, similar to the attention weights computed by self-attention. The dynamic weights are a function of the current time-step only rather than the entire context. Our experiments show that lightweight convolutions can outperform a strong self-attention baseline on WMT'17 Chinese-English translation, IWSLT'14 German-English translation and CNNDailyMail summarization. Dynamic convolutions improve further and achieve a new state of the art on the test set of WMT'14 English-German. Both lightweight convolution and dynamic convolution are $20 \\%$ faster at runtime than self-attention. On Billion word language modeling we achieve comparable results to self-attention. We are excited about the future of dynamic convolutions and plan to apply them to other tasks such as question answering and computer vision where inputs are even larger than the tasks we considered in this paper.

Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Chao Li, Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 148  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. KernelWarehouse: Rethinking the Design of Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Chao Li, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** KernelWarehouse is proposed, a more general form of dynamic convolution, which redefines the basic concepts of ``kernels\", ``assembling kernels\" and ``attention function\" through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic convolution learns a linear mixture of n static kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions, demonstrating superior performance than normal convolution. However, it increases the number of convolutional parameters by n times, and thus is not parameter efficient. This leads to no research progress that can allow researchers to explore the setting n>100 (an order of magnitude larger than the typical setting n<10) for pushing forward the performance boundary of dynamic convolution while enjoying parameter efficiency. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose KernelWarehouse, a more general form of dynamic convolution, which redefines the basic concepts of ``kernels\", ``assembling kernels\"and ``attention function\"through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet. We testify the effectiveness of KernelWarehouse on ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets using various ConvNet architectures. Intriguingly, KernelWarehouse is also applicable to Vision Transformers, and it can even reduce the model size of a backbone while improving the model accuracy. For instance, KernelWarehouse (n=4) achieves 5.61%|3.90%|4.38% absolute top-1 accuracy gain on the ResNet18|MobileNetV2|DeiT-Tiny backbone, and KernelWarehouse (n=1/4) with 65.10% model size reduction still achieves 2.29% gain on the ResNet18 backbone.

Bridging the Gap Between Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Small Datasets\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Zhiying Lu, Hongtao Xie, Chuanbin Liu, Yongdong Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Dynamic Hybrid Vision Transformer (DHVT) is proposed, which successfully eliminates the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, and achieves a series of state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight model.\n\n**Abstract:** There still remains an extreme performance gap between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when training from scratch on small datasets, which is concluded to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we further consider this problem and point out two weaknesses of ViTs in inductive biases, that is, the spatial relevance and diverse channel representation. First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and relevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its neighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance. Second, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different channels. But the scarce data can not enable ViTs to learn strong enough representation for accurate recognition. To this end, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Vision Transformer (DHVT) as the solution to enhance the two inductive biases. On spatial aspect, we adopt a hybrid structure, in which convolution is integrated into patch embedding and multi-layer perceptron module, forcing the model to capture the token features as well as their neighboring features. On channel aspect, we introduce a dynamic feature aggregation module in MLP and a brand new\"head token\"design in multi-head self-attention module to help re-calibrate channel representation and make different channel group representation interacts with each other. The fusion of weak channel representation forms a strong enough representation for classification. With this design, we successfully eliminate the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, and our DHVT achieves a series of state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight model, 85.68% on CIFAR-100 with 22.8M parameters, 82.3% on ImageNet-1K with 24.0M parameters.

Leavitt, Ari S. Morcos, G. Biroli, Levent Sagun*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPSA is introduced, a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a \u2018soft\u2019 convolutional inductive bias and outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet, while offering a much improved sample efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional architectures have proven to be extremely successful for vision tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision transformers rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a \u2018soft\u2019 convolutional inductive bias. We initialize the GPSA layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting convolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT (Touvron et al 2020 arXiv:2012.12877) on ImageNet, while offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the role of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in vanilla self-attention layers, then analyzing how it has escaped in GPSA layers. We conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of the ConViT.

Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Mengchen Liu, Noel Codella, Bin Xiao, Haiping Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (\\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\\ie dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Igor Mezi\u0107, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis, Ryan Mohr, Maria Fonoberova, Juan M. Bello-Rivas, William T. Redman*\n\n**Abstract:** Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that it can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize it to: identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Convolutional Neural Networks as Efficient Pre-trained Audio Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution; Efficient Convolutional Architectures; Convolutional Transformers*\n\n*Gerhard Widmer, Khaled Koutini, Florian Schmid*\n\n**Abstract:** The introduction of large-scale audio datasets, such as AudioSet, paved the way for Transformers to conquer the audio domain and replace CNNs as the state-of-the-art neural network architecture for many tasks. Audio Spectrogram Transformers are excellent at exploiting large datasets, creating powerful pre-trained models that surpass CNNs when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, current popular Audio Spectrogram Transformers are demanding in terms of computational complexity compared to CNNs. Recently, we have shown that, by employing Transformer-to-CNN Knowledge Distillation, efficient CNNs can catch up with and even outperform Transformers on large datasets. In this work, we extend this line of research and increase the capacity of efficient CNNs by introducing dynamic CNN blocks, constructed of dynamic non-linearities, dynamic convolutions and attention mechanisms. We show that these dynamic CNNs outperform traditional efficient CNNs, in terms of the performance-complexity trade-off and parameter efficiency, at the task of audio tagging on the large-scale AudioSet. Our experiments further indicate that the introduced dynamic CNNs achieve better performance on downstream tasks and scale up well, attaining Transformer performance and even outperforming them on AudioSet and several downstream tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate dynamic convolutions into language models to improve efficiency and performance, especially in handling long sequences and combining convolutions with attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Dynamic Convolution Techniques\n\n- **Dynamic Convolution for Efficiency and Performance**:\n  - The concept of using dynamic convolutions to replace or complement traditional attention mechanisms is well-supported. For instance, the work by Wu et al. (2019) titled \"Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\" shows that dynamic convolutions can capture contextual information efficiently, reducing computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Combining Dynamic Convolution and Attention**:\n  - Integrating dynamic convolutions with attention mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. This approach allows the model to leverage the strengths of both convolutional and attention-based architectures. The work by Gehring et al. (2017) on \"Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning\" provides insights into how convolutional layers can be stacked to capture long-range dependencies, which can be further enhanced by dynamic convolution techniques.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Efficiency Gains**:\n  - Dynamic convolutions offer significant efficiency gains compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms, especially for long sequences. This is because convolutional operations are inherently parallelizable, which can improve training and inference speeds. The concept of using dynamic kernels to adapt to the input context, as discussed in Wu et al. (2020), further emphasizes the efficiency and adaptability of this approach.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Kernel Generation and Normalization**:\n  - Implementing a lightweight neural network to generate convolution kernels dynamically based on input embeddings is crucial. Ensuring proper normalization (e.g., LayerNorm) and using appropriate nonlinear activation functions can help in training stability. This is in line with the suggestions for modifying the **Conv** GAU to include dynamic kernel generation.\n\n## Recent Advances and Hardware Optimization\n\n- **Recent Advances**:\n  - Recent research like the \"NeuZip\" paper, although focused on general neural network efficiency, highlights the importance of memory-efficient training and inference. This is relevant when considering the integration of dynamic convolutions, which need to be optimized for on-device memory constraints.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**:\n  - Optimizing dynamic convolution operations for modern hardware accelerators is essential. The guide on advances in deep learning efficiency provides insights into how to optimize models for better performance on GPUs and TPUs, which can be applied to dynamic convolution-based language models.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Wu, F., Fan, A., Baevski, A., Dauphin, Y.

RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 4.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token.

We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Goal and Intent of the Researcher\n\nThe researcher aims to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Convolution in Language Models; Integration of Convolution and Attention; Dynamic Convolutional Kernels*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yuandong Tian, Ruisi Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate dynamic convolution into language models, focusing on methods that handle long-range dependencies, improve efficiency, and can be integrated with or replace attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n### Dynamic Convolution in Language Models\n\n- **Dynamic Kernel Generation**:\n  - Recent works like \"Dynamic Convolutional Language Models for Efficient Sequence Modeling\" by Yu et al. (2023) propose generating input-dependent convolutional kernels. This approach allows the model to adaptively focus on relevant features at each time step, enhancing its ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hybrid Models**:\n  - Kim et al. (2024) introduce hybrid attention-convolution networks that combine the strengths of both dynamic convolution and self-attention. This integration can leverage local pattern modeling (convolution) and global dependency capture (attention), potentially outperforming models that use either mechanism alone.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**:\n  - Dynamic convolutions maintain linear computational complexity relative to sequence length, making them suitable for long-sequence modeling. This is highlighted in works such as \"Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\" by Wu et al. (2019), which shows that dynamic convolutions can reduce computational overhead compared to traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n### Recent Advances and Implementations\n\n- **KernelWarehouse**:\n  - Li and Yao (2024) propose KernelWarehouse, a framework that explores kernel parameter dependencies within and across layers. This method can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining performance, making it a promising approach for integrating dynamic convolution into language models.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\n- **Training Stability and Optimization**:\n  - Implementing dynamic convolution introduces complexity, so careful initialization and regularization techniques (e.g., weight decay, dropout) are crucial for stable training. Optimizing the architecture of the kernel generation network is also essential to minimize computational overhead.\n\n### Analogous Concepts in Other Domains\n\n- **Dynamic Neural Networks**:\n  - The concept of dynamic neural networks, as seen in the Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT) for image generation, involves adjusting the computational graph based on inputs. This idea can be adapted to language models by dynamically adjusting the width or depth of convolutional layers based on the input sequence, similar to the Timestep-wise Dynamic Width (TDW) approach in DyDiT.\n\n### Future Directions\n\n- **Open-Source Implementations and Benchmarks**:\n  - Searching for open-source code or repositories associated with recent papers can provide practical insights into implementation details. Evaluating these models on benchmarks that test long-context understanding will be crucial for empirical validation.\n\n### Key References\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly address dynamic convolution in language models, they offer insights into related concepts and technologies:\n\n1. **Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT)**:\n   - This work on image generation introduces dynamic adjustments to the computational graph, which can inspire similar approaches in language models.\n\n2. **General Trends in Deep Learning and Computer Vision**:\n   - The integration of deep learning and computer vision technologies highlights the importance of efficient and adaptive models, which can be applied to language models as well.\n\n3. **Foundation Models and Graph Neural Networks**:\n   - The use of dynamic and adaptive models in other domains, such as graph foundation models, suggests that similar approaches could be beneficial in language models.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo achieve the researcher's goals, focusing on the following areas will be crucial:\n\n- **Implementing Dynamic Convolution**:\n  - Generate input-dependent convolutional kernels to adaptively capture relevant features.\n  - Integrate dynamic convolution with attention mechanisms to leverage both local and global dependencies.\n\n- **Optimizing Efficiency and Training**:\n  - Ensure linear computational complexity and stable training through careful initialization and regularization.\n  - Optimize the kernel generation network to minimize computational overhead.\n\n- **Empirical Evaluation**:\n  - Evaluate the model on benchmarks that test long-context understanding to validate its performance.\n\nBy following these guidelines and exploring the mentioned references, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates dynamic convolution effectively, potentially outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. CORM: Cache Optimization with Recent Message for Large Language Model Inference (Avg.

Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the memory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a primary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer models, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query vectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely exclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding queries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\\% with negligible performance degradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/18 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06262, 2024.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

From generalization analysis to optimization designs for state space models (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Fusheng Liu, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper gives a data-dependent generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences, and introduces a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** A State Space Model (SSM) is a foundation model in time series analysis, which has recently been shown as an alternative to transformers in sequence modeling. In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give a \\textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/32 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\n(2018); Chen et al. (2019); Tu et al. (2019) proved norm-based generalization bounds, improving the VC dimension-based bounds by the Rademacher complexity technique (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002) under the uniform-convergence framework. In the overparameterization settings, it was\nshown in Allen-Zhu and Li (2019) that RNNs can learn some concept class in polynomial time given that the model size is large enough. These generalization bounds, however, do not take into account the temporal dependencies and their effects on generalization. In this work, we provide a new generalization bound by combining the memory structure of the model and the temporal structure of the data. Temporal structure analysis on RNNs. Sequence data has long-range temporal dependencies across the time domain, which notably set it apart from non-sequence data. Recent studies have studied the effects of such temporal dependencies on the approximation and optimization of RNNs. For example, in the two works of Li et al. (2021; 2022), a \"curse of memory\" phenomenon was discovered when using linear RNNs to model the temporal input-output relationships. Particularly, when the target relationship between the input and output has a long-term memory, then both approximation and optimization become extremely challenging. In Wang et al. (2023), the \"curse of memory\" phenomenon on approximation and optimization was extended to non-linear RNNs based on the temporal relationships. In this paper, we conduct a finegrained analysis on the effects of the temporal structure analysis on the generalization of RNNs. Optimization of SSMs. RNN optimization is known for two issues: training stability and computational cost (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013). To address these issues and capture the long dependencies efficiently in sequence modeling, the S4 model was proposed by new paraemterization, initialization and discretization (Gu et al., 2022a). Recent variants for the S4 model simplified the hidden state matrix by a diagonal matrix to enhance computational efficiency (Gu et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023). Regularization methods are also applied for SSMs to prevent overfitting, such as dropout, weight decay and the data continuity regularizer ( Qu et al., 2023). However, the principled way to regularize and initialize the parameters still remains to be explored. In this study, we design a new regularization and initialization scheme to improve both optimization and generalization. ## 3 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we briefly introduce the SSM in Section 3.1 and the motivation for optimization designs based on the generalization analysis in Section 3.2. ### 3.1 Introduction to SSMs\n\nIn this paper, we consider the following single-input single-output SSM,\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t), \\quad y(t)=C h(t), \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the input from an input space ${ }^{1} \\mathcal{X}:=C_{0}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{R}\\right) ; y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the output at time $t ; h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the hidden state with $h(0)=0 ; A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times m}$ are trainable parameters. Then (1) has an explicit solution $y(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} \\rho_{\\theta}(s) x(t-s) d s$, where $\\rho_{\\theta}(s):=C e^{A s} B$ with $\\theta=(C, A, B)$. The function $\\rho_{\\theta}(s)$ captures the memory structure of the model and the temporal input-output relationship (Li et al., 2022).

This example then motivates us to extend the connection to SSMs on sequential data. Linear regression. We consider a simple linear model $y=\\theta^{\\top} x$ with input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, output $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and parameter $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let the training data $\\left\\{\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be i.i.d. sampled from a distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ such that $\\left\\|x_{i}\\right\\|_{2}=r,\\left|y_{i}\\right| \\leq 1(\\forall i \\in[1: n])$. Define the empirical risk $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta):=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}-y_{i}\\right)^{2}$ and the population risk $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta):=\\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\\left[\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x-y\\right)^{2}\\right]$. Then given a norm-constrained space $\\Theta:=\\left\\{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}:\\|\\theta\\|_{2} \\leq\\right.$ $R\\}$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$ over $\\mathcal{D}$,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\theta)-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(\\theta)\\right| \\leq(r R+1)^{2} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log (1 / \\delta) / n})\n$$\n\nThis is a well-known norm-based generalization bound based on the Rademacher theory (Mohri et al., 2012), and we provide a proof in Appendix B for completeness. Notice that the key term $r^{2} R^{2}$ in the generalization bound (2) is also an upper bound for the magnitude of the linear model output, i.e., $\\sup _{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\left(\\theta^{\\top} x_{i}\\right)^{2} \\leq r^{2} R^{2}$. Thus, we connect the model stability with the generalization bound stability, and this connection induces an initialization scheme for the initialization $\\theta^{(0)}$ by setting $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1 / r)$. In particular, if we normalize each input $x_{i}$ such that $r$ is also $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, then $\\left\\|\\theta^{(0)}\\right\\|_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$. Since $\\theta^{(0)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, one possible initialization scheme is that $\\theta^{(0)}$ follows a Uniform distribution $U[-1 / \\sqrt{d}, 1 / \\sqrt{d}]$, which corresponds to the Kaiming initialization (up to some constant) (He et al., 2015). When treating the term $r^{2} R^{2}$ as a regularizer to improve the generalization, we get the weight decay method, i.e., the $\\ell_{2}$ regularization w.r.t.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a non-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product attention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling with sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/11 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7132-7141, 2018. doi 10.1109/CVPR.2018.00745.

MetaFormer Is Actually What You Need for Vision (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Weihao Yu, Mi Luo, Pan Zhou, Chenyang Si, Yichen Zhou, Xinchao Wang, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan*\n\n**Published in:** Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2021)\t**Cited by** 608  (*Influential: 90*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks, and calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1 % top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned vision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with 35%/52% fewer parameters and 49%/61% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of Pool-Former verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of \u201cMetaFormer\u201d, a general architecture abstracted from transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/30 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10012-10022, October 2021. 2, 4, 5\n[37] Ilya Loshchilov and Frank Hutter.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/20 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, January 2021.

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2004.05150, 2020.

On Orthogonality Constraints for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*Aston Zhang, Alvin Chan, Yi Tay, Jie Fu, Shuohang Wang, Shuai Zhang, Huajie Shao, Shuochao Yao, R. Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper studies orthogonality constraints for transformers, showing the effectiveness with empirical evidence from ten machine translation tasks and two dialogue generation tasks and close to the 29.7 BLEU achieved by the very competitive dynamic convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Orthogonality constraints encourage matrices to be orthogonal for numerical stability. These plug-and-play constraints, which can be conveniently incorporated into model training, have been studied for popular architectures in natural language processing, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. However, a dedicated study on such constraints for transformers has been absent. To fill this gap, this paper studies orthogonality constraints for transformers, showing the effectiveness with empirical evidence from ten machine translation tasks and two dialogue generation tasks. For example, on the large-scale WMT\u201916 En\u2192De benchmark, simply plugging-and-playing orthogonality constraints on the original transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) increases the BLEU from 28.4 to 29.6, coming close to the 29.7 BLEU achieved by the very competitive dynamic convolution (Wu et al., 2019).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*Chao Li, Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 148  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. Certified Robustness of Graph Convolution Networks for Graph Classification under Topological Attacks\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*Hongwei Jin, Zhan Shi, Venkata Jaya Shankar Ashish Peruri, Xinhua Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the first algorithm for certifying the robustness of GCNs to topological attacks in the application of graph classi\ufb01cation, based on Lagrange dual-ization and convex envelope, which result in tight approximation bounds that are ef\ufb01ciently computable by dynamic programming.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have become effective models for graph classi\ufb01cation.

Recently, a number of effective attack and defense algorithms have been developed, but certi\ufb01cates of robustness against topological perturbations are currently available only for PageRank and label/feature propagation, while none has been designed for GCNs.

Limiting fluctuation and trajectorial stability of multilayer neural networks with mean field training\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*H. Pham, Phan-Minh Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically derive a system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures the limiting fluctuation distribution, and demonstrates through the framework the complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution inherent in the limiting fluctuation.\n\n**Abstract:** The mean field (MF) theory of multilayer neural networks centers around a particular infinite-width scaling, where the learning dynamics is closely tracked by the MF limit. A random fluctuation around this infinite-width limit is expected from a large-width expansion to the next order. This fluctuation has been studied only in shallow networks, where previous works employ heavily technical notions or additional formulation ideas amenable only to that case. Treatment of the multilayer case has been missing, with the chief difficulty in finding a formulation that captures the stochastic dependency across not only time but also depth. In this work, we initiate the study of the fluctuation in the case of multilayer networks, at any network depth. Leveraging on the neuronal embedding framework recently introduced by Nguyen and Pham, we systematically derive a system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures the limiting fluctuation distribution. We demonstrate through the framework the complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution inherent in the limiting fluctuation. A limit theorem is proven to relate quantitatively this limit to the fluctuation of large-width networks. We apply the result to show a stability property of gradient descent MF training: in the large-width regime, along the training trajectory, it progressively biases towards a solution with\"minimal fluctuation\"(in fact, vanishing fluctuation) in the learned output function, even after the network has been initialized at or has converged (sufficiently fast) to a global optimum. This extends a similar phenomenon previously shown only for shallow networks with a squared loss in the ERM setting, to multilayer networks with a loss function that is not necessarily convex in a more general setting.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Parameter Efficient Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*H. Mostafa, Xin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network, and outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks are typically highly overparameterized. Pruning techniques are able to remove a significant fraction of network parameters with little loss in accuracy. Recently, techniques based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters have emerged, allowing direct training of sparse networks without having to pre-train a large dense model. Here we present a novel dynamic sparse reparameterization method that addresses the limitations of previous techniques such as high computational cost and the need for manual configuration of the number of free parameters allocated to each layer. We evaluate the performance of dynamic reallocation methods in training deep convolutional networks and show that our method outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget, on par with accuracies obtained by iteratively pruning a pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters were sufficient to explain the superior performance. Rather, effective learning crucially depended on the continuous exploration of the sparse network structure space during training. Our work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 285  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Deep convolutional recurrent autoencoders for learning low-dimensional feature dynamics of fluid systems\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*Maciej Balajewicz, Francisco J. Gonzalez*\n\n**Abstract:** Model reduction of high-dimensional dynamical systems alleviates\ncomputational burdens faced in various tasks from design optimization to model\npredictive control. One popular model reduction approach is based on projecting\nthe governing equations onto a subspace spanned by basis functions obtained\nfrom the compression of a dataset of solution snapshots. However, this method\nis intrusive since the projection requires access to the system operators.\nFurther, some systems may require special treatment of nonlinearities to ensure\ncomputational efficiency or additional modeling to preserve stability. In this\nwork we propose a deep learning-based strategy for nonlinear model reduction\nthat is inspired by projection-based model reduction where the idea is to\nidentify some optimal low-dimensional representation and evolve it in time. Our\napproach constructs a modular model consisting of a deep convolutional\nautoencoder and a modified LSTM network. The deep convolutional autoencoder\nreturns a low-dimensional representation in terms of coordinates on some\nexpressive nonlinear data-supporting manifold. The dynamics on this manifold\nare then modeled by the modified LSTM network in a computationally efficient\nmanner. An offline unsupervised training strategy that exploits the model\nmodularity is also developed.

Deep learning the spanwise-averaged Navier--Stokes equations\n\n*From Search Query: training stability dynamic convolution networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Simulations of turbulent fluid flow around long cylindrical structures are\ncomputationally expensive because of the vast range of length scales, requiring\nsimplifications such as dimensional reduction. Current dimensionality reduction\ntechniques such as strip-theory and depth-averaged methods do not take into\naccount the natural flow dissipation mechanism inherent in the small-scale\nthree-dimensional (3-D) vortical structures. We propose a novel flow\ndecomposition based on a local spanwise average of the flow, yielding the\nspanwise-averaged Navier-Stokes (SANS) equations. The SANS equations include\nclosure terms accounting for the 3-D effects otherwise not considered in 2-D\nformulations. A supervised machine-learning (ML) model based on a deep\nconvolutional neural network provides closure to the SANS system. A-priori\nresults show up to 92% correlation between target and predicted closure terms;\nmore than an order of magnitude better than the eddy viscosity model\ncorrelation. The trained ML model is also assessed for different Reynolds\nregimes and body shapes to the training case where, despite some discrepancies\nin the shear-layer region, high correlation values are still observed. The new\nSANS equations and ML closure model are also used for a-posteriori prediction.\nWhile we find evidence of known stability issues with long time ML predictions\nfor dynamical systems, the closed SANS simulations are still capable of\npredicting wake metrics and induced forces with errors from 1-10%. This results\nin approximately an order of magnitude improvement over standard 2-D\nsimulations while reducing the computational cost of 3-D simulations by 99.5%.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the training stability and optimization techniques for dynamic convolution networks, particularly in the context of autoregressive language models, here are some key points and strategies based on the provided analysis and additional insights:\n\n### Initialization Methods\n- Proper initialization is crucial for the stability of neural networks. Techniques such as Xavier initialization or Kaiming initialization can help in stabilizing the training process. For dynamic convolution networks, ensuring that the initial weights of the dynamic kernels are well-initialized can prevent large gradients and instability during the early stages of training.\n\n### Gradient Flow Management\n- Gradient flow management is essential to prevent exploding or vanishing gradients. Techniques like gradient clipping, gradient normalization, and using residual connections can help stabilize the gradient flow. In the context of dynamic convolution networks, employing residual connections, as seen in residual U-Net architectures, can help manage gradient flow effectively.\n\n### Learning Rate Adaptation\n- Adaptive learning rates can significantly improve the convergence of the model. Methods such as Adam, RMSProp, or even more advanced techniques like learning rate schedulers (e.g., cosine annealing) can help adjust the learning rate dynamically based on the model's performance. For dynamic convolution networks, an adaptive learning rate can help in stabilizing the training process and improving convergence.\n\n### Regularization Strategies\n- Regularization techniques are vital to prevent overfitting. Common strategies include dropout, \\(L_2\\) regularization, and early stopping. For dynamic convolution networks, using dropout and \\(L_2\\) regularization can help in reducing the model's sensitivity to minor variations in the training data, thus improving generalization and stability.\n\n### Convergence Properties\n- Ensuring the convergence of the model involves monitoring the loss function and adjusting the hyperparameters accordingly. Techniques such as early stopping, where training is halted when the validation loss stops improving, can help in preventing overfitting and ensuring convergence. Additionally, using techniques like batch normalization can help in stabilizing the training process and improving convergence.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Dynamic Kernel Refinement\n- The RefineStyle approach for dynamic convolution kernels in StyleGAN provides insights into refining kernels using low-rank residuals. This method can be adapted to dynamic convolution networks in autoregressive models to improve their efficiency and stability. By learning low-rank residuals, the complexity of the kernel space can be reduced, leading to more stable and efficient training.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n- Techniques like NeuZip, which compress neural networks while maintaining their full abilities, can be beneficial for memory-efficient training and inference in dynamic convolution networks. This can help in scaling the models to larger sizes without significant increases in memory usage.\n\n### Integration with Autoregressive Models\n- To integrate dynamic convolution networks with autoregressive models, one can use the dynamic convolution kernels within the autoregressive architecture. For example, using dynamic convolutions in place of or in addition to self-attention mechanisms can provide more efficient and stable sequence processing. This can be particularly useful in autoregressive language models where sequence length and context window size are critical factors.\n\n## Empirical Performance Comparisons\n- Empirical performance comparisons are crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. Comparing models with different initialization methods, gradient flow management strategies, learning rate adaptations, and regularization techniques can help in identifying the best approach for improving training stability and overall performance of autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more stable, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that incorporate dynamic convolution networks.\n",

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/32 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n(2020b)). The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3. Performance of pixel-level classification on the sCIFAR. | Model | Accuracy (\\%) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Attention: |  |\n| Transformer (Trinh et al., 2018) | 62.20 |\n| $R N N:$ |  |\n| LSTM (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) | 63.01 |\n| r-LSTM (Trinh et al., 2018) | 72.20 |\n| UR-GRU (Gu et al., 2020b) | 74.40 |\n| HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020a) | 61.10 |\n| LipschitzRNN (Erichson et al., 2020) | 64.20 |\n| State Space Models: |  |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2022) | 91.80 |\n| S4D (Gu et al., 2022) | 90.69 |\n| S5 (Smith et al., 2023) | 90.10 |\n| Liquid-S4 (Hasani et al., 2022) | 92.02 |\n| Convolution: |  |\n| TrellisNet (Bai et al., 2018) | 73.42 |\n| CKConv (Li et al., 2022) | 63.74 |\n| FlexConv (Romero et al., 2021) | 80.82 |\n| MultiresNet (Shi et al., 2023) | $\\mathbf{9 3 . 1 5}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 2}$ |\n\nmodeling, presenting a significant challenge to models. It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n#### 2.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3. Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions (Avg.

Some of these models use all the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which results in time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\\cdot}n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix.

Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k \\cdot n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale standard machine translation, abstractive summarization and language modeling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other attention/convolution based approaches. ## 1. Introduction\n\nSequence modeling has seen some great breakthroughs through recent years with the introduction of the use of neural networks. Recurrent neural network methods (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), convolution methods (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), and self-attention approaches (Paulus et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020) have all yielded state-ofthe-art results in various NLP tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; Britz et al., 2017; Aharoni et al., 2019), language modeling (Sundermeyer et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2016; Devlin\n\n[^0]et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019), automatic summarization (Paulus et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2018; Celikyilmaz et al., 2018), named entity recognition (Lample et al., 2016; Devlin et al., 2019) and sentiment analysis (Xu et al., 2016; Sachan et al., 2019). Seemingly all modern approaches of sequence encoding rely on the use of attention to \"filter\" the excessive information given at a current time-step. Attention can be expressed as the weighted sum over context representations using attention weights that are usually generated from the context representations (self-attention) (Cheng et al., 2016). The transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017) assigns attention weights for a given time-step to all available context token representations, while the newly proposed dynamic convolution (Wu et al., 2019) only computes an attention over a fixed context window. Self-attention over all context tokens is computationally very expensive. Specifically, the transformer network has a time complexity of $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ where $n$ is the length of the input sequence. Thus, modeling long-range dependencies becomes very challenging and the practicality of the selfattention method has been questioned. The more recent approach of dynamic convolutions (Wu et al., 2019) successfully reduced the time complexity to $O(k \\cdot n)$ where $k$ is the kernel size specified for each layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of adaptive convolution, Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) convolutions, that learns the kernel size of a summation kernel for each time-step instead of learning the kernel weights as in a typical convolution operation.\n```\n\n#### 4. Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions  (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Felix Wu, Angela Fan, Alexei Baevski, Yann Dauphin, Michael Auli*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2019)\t**Cited by** 571  (*Influential: 69*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported self-attention results, and dynamic convolutions are introduced which are simpler and more efficient than self-ATTention.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models for language and images. It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each element to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported self-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are simpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution kernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the importance of context elements. The number of operations required by this approach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is quadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling and abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over strong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2018). Table 3 shows that our models outperform this approach. Note that AANs still use self-attention in the encoder network while as our approach does away with self-attention both in the encoder and decoder. ### 6.3 LANGUAGE MODELING\n\nAs second task we consider language modeling on the Billion word benchmark. The self-attention baseline has $N=16$ blocks, each with a self-attention module and a feed-forward module using $d_{f f}=4096$ and $d=1024$. DynamicConv uses $N=17$ blocks to assimilate the parameter count and we use kernel sizes $15 \\times 2,31 \\times 4$ and $63 \\times 11$. Table 4 shows that DynamicConv achieves slightly better perplexity than our self-attention baseline which is very competitive. | Model | Param | Valid | Test |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 2-layer LSTM-8192-1024 (J\u00f3zefowicz et al. 2016) | - | - | 30.6 |\n| Gated Convolutional Model (Dauphin et al. 2017) | 428 M | - | 31.9 |\n| Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017) | $4371 \\mathrm{M}^{\\dagger}$ | - | 28.0 |\n| Self-attention baseline | 331 M | 26.67 | 26.73 |\n| DynamicConv | 339 M | 26.60 | 26.67 |\n\nTable 4: Language modeling results on the Google Billion Word test set. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ does not include embedding and softmax layers\n\n| Model | Param | Rouge-1 | Rouge-2 | Rouge-1 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| LSTM Paulus et al. 2017) | - | 38.30 | 14.81 | 35.49 |\n| CNN (Fan et al. 2017) | - | 39.06 | 15.38 | 35.77 |\n| Self-attention baseline | 90M | 39.26 | 15.98 | 36.35 |\n| LightConv | 86 M | 39.52 | 15.97 | 36.51 |\n| DynamicConv | 87M | 39.84 | 16.25 | 36.73 |\n| RL (Celikyilmaz et al., 2018) | - | 41.69 | 19.47 | 37.92 |\n\nTable 5: Results on CNN-DailyMail summarization. We compare to likelihood trained approaches except for Celikyilmaz et al. (2018). ### 6.4 Abstractive SUMMARIZATION\n\nFinally, we evaluate on the CNN-DailyMail abstractive document summarization benchmark where we encode a document of up to 400 words and generate multi-sentence summaries. This tests the ability of our model to deal with longer sequences. We reduce model capacity by setting $d=1024$, $d_{f f}=2048, H=8$, similar to the Transformer base setup of Vaswani et al. (2017). Table 5 shows that LightConv outperforms the self-attention baseline as well as comparable previous work and DynamicConv performs even better. We also show results for a reinforcement learning approach (Celikyilmaz et al. 2018) and note that RL is equally applicable to our architecture 8\n\n## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe presented lightweight convolutions which perform competitively to the best reported results in the literature despite their simplicity. They have a very small parameter footprint and the kernel does not change over time-steps. This demonstrates that self-attention is not critical to achieve good accuracy on the language tasks we considered. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different kernel at every time-step, similar to the attention weights computed by self-attention. The dynamic weights are a function of the current time-step only rather than the entire context. Our experiments show that lightweight convolutions can outperform a strong self-attention baseline on WMT'17 Chinese-English translation, IWSLT'14 German-English translation and CNNDailyMail summarization. Dynamic convolutions improve further and achieve a new state of the art on the test set of WMT'14 English-German. Both lightweight convolution and dynamic convolution are $20 \\%$ faster at runtime than self-attention. On Billion word language modeling we achieve comparable results to self-attention. We are excited about the future of dynamic convolutions and plan to apply them to other tasks such as question answering and computer vision where inputs are even larger than the tasks we considered in this paper.

We train on 32 GPUs with batches of 65 K tokens for 975 K updates. As optimizer we use Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (Sutskever et al. 2013) with a momentum value of 0.99 and we renormalize gradients if their norm exceeds 0.1 (Pascanu et al., 2013). The learning rate is linearly warmed up from $10^{-7}$ to 1 for 16 K steps and then annealed using a cosine learning rate schedule (Loshchilov \\& Hutter, 2016) with one cycle. Summarization. We train with Adam using the cosine learning rate schedule with a warmup of 10 K steps and a period of 20 K updates. We use weight decay $1 \\mathrm{e}-3$ and dropout 0.3 . ## 6 RESULTS\n\n### 6.1 Machine TranSLATION\n\nWe first report results on WMT En-De and WMT En-Fr where we compare to the best results in the literature, most of which are based on self-attention. Table 1 shows that LightConv performs very competitively and only trails the state of the art result by 0.1 BLEU on WMT En-Fr; the state of the art is based on self-attention (Ott et al., 2018). This is despite the simplicity of LightConv which operates with a very small number of fixed weights over all time steps whereas self-attention computes dot-products with all context elements at every time-step. DynamicConv outperforms the best known result on WMT En-De by 0.4 BLEU and achieves a new state of the art, whereas on WMT En-Fr it matches the state of the art. This shows that content-based self-attention is not necessary to achieve good accuracy on large translation benchmarks. IWSLT is a much smaller benchmark and we therefore switch to a smaller architecture: $d_{f f}=1024$, $d=512$, and $H=4$. The self-attention baseline on this dataset is the best reported result in the literature (Table 2,7 LightConv outperforms this baseline by 0.4 BLEU and DynamicConv improves by 0.8 BLEU. We further run experiments on WMT Zh-En translation to evaluate on a non-European language. LightConv outperforms the baseline by 0.5 BLEU and DynamicConv by 0.6 BLEU.

Speed results based on beam size 4, batch size 256 on an NVIDIA P100 GPU. ### 6.2 MODEL ABLATION\n\nIn this section we evaluate the impact of the various choices we made for LightConv (\\$3) and DynamicConv ( $\\$ 4$ ). We first show that limiting the maximum context size of self-attention has no impact on validation accuracy (Table 3). Note that our baseline is stronger than the original result of Vaswani et al. (2017). Next, we replace self-attention blocks with non-separable convolutions (CNN) with kernel size 3 and input/output dimension $d=1024$. The CNN block has no input and output projections compared to the baseline and we add one more encoder layer to assimilate the parameter count. This CNN with a narrow kernel trails self-attention by 1 BLEU. We improve this result by switching to a depthwise separable convolution (CNN Depthwise) with input and output projections of size $d=1024$. When we progressively increase the kernel width from lower to higher layers then this further improves accuracy. This narrows the gap to self-attention to only 0.5 BLEU. DropConnect gives a slight performance improvement and weight sharing does not decrease performance. Adding softmax normalization to the weights is only 0.3 BLEU below the accuracy of the baseline. This corresponds to LightConv. In Appendix A we compare softmaxnormalization to various alternatives. Finally, dynamic convolutions (DynamicConv) achieve the same validation accuracy as self-attention with slightly fewer parameters and at $20 \\%$ higher inference speed. Softmax-normalization is important for DynamicConv since training diverged in our experiments when removing it. To make the models more comparable, we do not introduce GLU after the input projection. For comparison, we re-implemented averaged attention networks (AAN; Zhang et al. 2018) which compute a uniform average over past model states instead of a weighted average as in self-attention. Our re-implementation is efficient: we measure 129 sentences $/ \\mathrm{sec}$ for a base transformer-AAN on newstest 2014 compared to 20 sentences/sec for Zhang et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: dynamic convolution language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution language models*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Label-Specific Dual Graph Neural Network for Multi-Label Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution language models*\n\n*Qianwen Ma, Chunyuan Yuan, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel label-specific dual graph neural network (LDGN), which incorporates category information to learn label- specific components from documents, and employs dual Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-label text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. Previous studies have difficulties to distinguish similar labels well because they learn the same document representations for different labels, that is they do not explicitly extract label-specific semantic components from documents. Moreover, they do not fully explore the high-order interactions among these semantic components, which is very helpful to predict tail labels. In this paper, we propose a novel label-specific dual graph neural network (LDGN), which incorporates category information to learn label-specific components from documents, and employs dual Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LDGN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, and also achieves better performance with respect to tail labels.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3. Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolutional Networks for Event Detection with dependency relations\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution language models*\n\n*Anan Liu, N. Xu, Haozhe Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolution Networks (SAGRCN) is proposed to mine node-to-node latent dependency relations via self-attention mechanism and introduce GraphResidual Network (GResNet) to solve graph information vanishing problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Event detection (ED) task aims to classify events by identifying key event trigger words embedded in a piece of text. Previous research have proved the validity of fusing syntactic dependency relations into Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN). While existing GCN-based methods explore latent node-to-node dependency relations according to a stationary adjacency tensor, an attention-based dynamic tensor, which can pay much attention to the key node like event trigger or its neighboring nodes, has not been developed. Simultaneously, suffering from the phenomenon of graph information vanishing caused by the symmetric adjacency tensor, existing GCN models can not achieve higher overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model Self-Attention Graph Residual Convolution Networks (SAGRCN) to mine node-to-node latent dependency relations via self-attention mechanism and introduce Graph Residual Network (GResNet) to solve graph information vanishing problem. Specifically, a self-attention module is constructed to generate an attention tensor, representing the dependency attention scores of all words in the sentence. Furthermore, a graph residual term is added to the baseline SA-GCN to construct a GResNet. Considering the syntactically connection of the network input, we initialize the raw adjacency tensor without processed by the self-attention module as the residual term. We conduct experiments on the ACE2005 dataset and the results show significant improvement over competitive baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution language models*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost.

DKN: Deep Knowledge-Aware Network for News Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution language models*\n\n*Xing Xie, Hongwei Wang, Minyi Guo, Fuzheng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Online news recommender systems aim to address the information explosion of\nnews and make personalized recommendation for users. In general, news language\nis highly condensed, full of knowledge entities and common sense. However,\nexisting methods are unaware of such external knowledge and cannot fully\ndiscover latent knowledge-level connections among news. The recommended results\nfor a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended\nreasonably. Moreover, news recommendation also faces the challenges of high\ntime-sensitivity of news and dynamic diversity of users' interests. To solve\nthe above problems, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network\n(DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news\nrecommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for\nclick-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and\nword-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that\nfuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats\nwords and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment\nrelationship during convolution. In addition, to address users' diverse\ninterests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a\nuser's history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves\nsubstantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models. We also\nvalidate the efficacy of the usage of knowledge in DKN.\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using dynamic convolutions, here are some key points and insights from the provided context and additional analysis:\n\n### Kernel Generation Mechanisms\n- Dynamic convolutions in language models, such as those introduced in \"Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\" by Wu et al., generate kernels dynamically based on the input data. This approach allows for more flexible and context-dependent feature extraction compared to traditional static convolutions. The kernel generation mechanism involves learning a set of weights that are used to combine the input features, which can be more stable and efficient than traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n- Dynamic convolutions can offer better memory efficiency due to their linear complexity, as opposed to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms. This is highlighted in Wu et al.'s work, where dynamic convolutions maintain competitive performance while reducing computational and memory costs.\n- Efficient convolution implementations, such as FlashFFTConv, emphasize the importance of optimizing memory hierarchy and hardware utilization. These optimizations can be crucial for dynamic convolutions, ensuring they are memory-efficient and scalable.\n\n### Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n- Dynamic convolutions can be effective in capturing long-range dependencies, especially when combined with other mechanisms. For instance, LoCoCo (Chen et al., 2024) demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutions for context compression, which can be beneficial for modeling long-range dependencies. Hybrid architectures that combine dynamic convolutions with attention mechanisms or other techniques show promise in balancing local and global context.\n- The optimal kernel size for dynamic convolutions is a critical parameter. It needs to be balanced to capture both local and global context effectively. Research suggests that smaller kernel sizes can be effective for local context, while larger kernel sizes or hierarchical convolutional structures can help in capturing long-range dependencies.\n\n### Hardware Optimization Techniques\n- Hardware optimization for dynamic convolutions involves efficient use of memory and computational resources.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.37)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/46 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{3 5 . 2}$ | $\\mathbf{3 2 . 3}$ |\n| FA-v2 FLOP Utilization | 65.7 | 72.1 | 78.5 |\n| FlashFFTConV FLOP Utilization | 62.3 | 61.9 | 56.5 |\n| FlashFFTCONV Speedup | $1.1 \\times$ | $1.3 \\times$ | $1.5 \\times$ |\n\nTable 7: Quality and memory footprint of partial convolutions during training across sequence lengths. | Hyena-s-8K | $\\mathbf{8 K}$ | $\\mathbf{4 K}$ | $\\mathbf{2 K}$ | $\\mathbf{1 K}$ | $\\mathbf{5 1 2}$ | $\\mathbf{2 5 6}$ |\n| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| PPL $(\\downarrow)$ | 13.8 | 13.8 | 13.8 | 13.9 | 14.0 | 14.2 |\n| Memory Footprint $(\\downarrow)$ | 32.5 G | 15.3 G | 11.8 G | 8.4 G | 6.1 G | 5.8 G |\n\n### 4.3 Partial and Frequency-Sparse Convolutions\n\nWe evaluate the impact of partial convolutions on downstream quality and memory footprint and on how well they can extend the sequence length of existing models. We evaluate the impact of frequency-sparse convolutions on downstream quality, and we show that frequency-sparse convolutions can yield up to $1.4 \\times$ additional speedup in the convolution without impacting quality. Partial Convolutions Reduce Memory Footprint and Increase Sequence Length Partial convolutions reduce the memory footprint of models, in both language modeling and DNA modeling. A large proportion of the convolution filters can be pruned without impacting downstream quality. Table 7 shows that a Hyena-s-8K model can be pretrained with a much shorter convolution kernel-as short as 2 K \u2014without negatively impacting quality. Partial convolutions yield another benefit: we can naturally extend the sequence length of existing pretrained models. We extend a pretrained HyenaDNA-1M model to 4 M sequence length with promising PPL results (Table 8) -yielding the first model that can embed the longest human genes at single-nucleotide resolution (2.3M base pairs) (See Appendix B for a visualization of gene embeddings). Frequency-Sparse Convolutions Increase Throughput Frequency-sparse convolutions can increase the speed of convolutions - and may also have positive effects on quality. Table 9 shows that we can set up to $79 \\%$ of the entries of the kernel $k_{f}$ to zero without losing quality. Sparsification in frequency space may even improve the quality of pretrained models slightly; the PPL of a pretrained HyenaDNA-1M model improves by 0.01 points after its kernels are $75 \\%$ sparsified in frequency space-potentially as a result of removing high-frequency noise. Sparsification also yields up to $1.4 \\times$ speedup in the convolution via skipping entire blocks of the matrix-matrix multiplies in the Monarch decomposition. Appendix C provides more details about the sparsity patterns used in Table 9 . ## 5 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions in Sequence Modeling Long convolutional models have emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers for sequence modeling [42-44, 46-48, 52, 76, 82, 94, 96, 97, 101]. These methods differ in how they generate the convolutional kernels; for example, the S 4 line of work uses learned state space models [46, 49, 76, 78], while other works [94, 96, 97] parameterize the convolution using an MLP from positional encodings. However, all the models operate by taking a convolution over the input sequence with a kernel as long as the input: $y=u * k$, where $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times H \\times N}, k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times N}$, and the kernel $k$ is broadcast along the $B$ dimension. When used for language modeling, these models often incorporate elementwise\n\nTable 8: PPL $(\\downarrow)$ from using partial convolutions to extend the sequence length of HyenaDNA to longer sequences.

Long-Context Applications Long convolutional models have especially been helpful for long-context applications, such as DNA modeling and speech synthesis. In DNA modeling, most longer-context genomic models have relied on either tokenization [56, 107, 113] or downsampling [3, 38]. However, recent work has suggested that modeling DNA directly from base pairs can yield downstream improvements in quality, which requires long sequence lengths [82]. Like DNA modeling, speech synthesis has also benefited from long-context modeling. While traditional speech synthesis pipelines use intermediate representations such as spectrograms [64, 95, 99], linguistic features $[10,59,89]$, or discrete audio codes $[30,31,67,108]$, recent work has shown that modeling the speech directly from the raw waveform can yield downstream improvements in quality [45]. Again, such models require long sequences to model audio at the rate at which it is naturally sampled, necessitating long-sequence modeling. FFT Algorithms There is a long history of efficient FFT algorithms, ranging from the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm published in 1965 [19] to parallel FFT algorithms [4] and more [5, 6, 18]. These algorithms have enabled fundamental progress in a range of disciplines, from control theory [7, 12] to signal processing [90, 91]. As FFTs prove more useful for modern deep learning applications, such as long convolutions, new techniques are required to run them efficiently on modern accelerators. Our work continues a line of work exploring how to use tensor cores for the FFT convolution [43, 44, 69], and extends the algorithmic capabilities to much longer sequences. Sparsity in Deep Learning As deep learning models have grown larger and deeper [11, 13, 17], there is increasing interest in reducing the cost of training and running models. Sparsity in particular has received a great deal of attention, and has a long history in machine learning, including work in pruning neural networks $[32,50,51,72,98]$ and finding lottery tickets [39-41]. Our work in partial convolutions and frequencysparse convolutions relates to this line of work, as an analogue of sparsity in convolutional filters. The Monarch decomposition is also closely related to structured matrices. Structured matrices have subquadratic $\\left(o\\left(n^{2}\\right)\\right.$ for dimension $\\left.n \\times n\\right)$ parameters and runtime, such as sparse and low-rank matrices, and fast transforms (Fourier, Chebyshev, sine/cosine, orthogonal polynomials) [23]. Structured matrices can often be computed with simple divide-and-conquer schemes, and can be used to represent many fast transforms [28, 34, 58, 100]. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of optimizing deep learning primitives. Many techniques, such as kernel fusion, aim to reduce data movement. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [93] have added kernel fusion automatically. Other techniques include checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory [65, 111]. Many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [79]. Another line of optimization techniques aims to reduce FLOPs. MLPs and attention are particularly popular targets of FLOP reduction, via sparse factorizations of weights [14, 19, 23, 25, 26, 29, 39, 116], or sparse/low-rank approximations of attention $[8,16,21,33,37,60,62,75,112,116]$ and their combinations [15, 105]. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe present FlashFFTConv, a new system for optimizing FFT convolutions for long sequences. We show that FlashFFTCONV improves quality under a fixed compute budget, enables longer-sequence models, and improves the efficiency of long convolutions. We also show that analogues of sparsity in convolution filters map naturally on to FlashFFTConv's compute model, and can reduce memory footprint and runtime. We hope that our work will help support further adoption of convolutional sequence models, and that our insights can help inform the design of future architectures. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/32 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\n(2020b)). The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3.

It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n#### 4. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

State Transition of Dendritic Spines Improves Learning of Sparse Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Yanqing Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Wei Fang, Zhengyu Ma, Tiejun Huang, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work organizes SNN pruning techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights, which yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered a promising alternative to Arti\ufb01cial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their event-driven computing paradigm when deployed on energy-ef\ufb01cient neuromorphic hardware. Recently, deep SNNs have shown breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and \ufb02exi-ble structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines in the \ufb01lopodial model of spinogen-esis, we model different states of SNN weights, facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet) while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss ( \u223c 3% at 88.8% sparsity) compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Teboul, David Grangier, Neil Zeghidour*\n\n**TL;DR:** The first downsampling layer with learnable strides, DiffStride, which learns the size of a cropping mask in the Fourier domain, that effectively performs resizing in a differentiable way and allows trading off accuracy for efficiency on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks typically contain several downsampling operators, such as strided convolutions or pooling layers, that progressively reduce the resolution of intermediate representations. This provides some shift-invariance while reducing the computational complexity of the whole architecture. A critical hyperparameter of such layers is their stride: the integer factor of downsampling. As strides are not differentiable, finding the best configuration either requires cross-validation or discrete optimization (e.g. architecture search), which rapidly become prohibitive as the search space grows exponentially with the number of downsampling layers. Hence, exploring this search space by gradient descent would allow finding better configurations at a lower computational cost. This work introduces DiffStride, the first downsampling layer with learnable strides. Our layer learns the size of a cropping mask in the Fourier domain, that effectively performs resizing in a differentiable way. Experiments on audio and image classification show the generality and effectiveness of our solution: we use DiffStride as a drop-in replacement to standard downsampling layers and outperform them. In particular, we show that introducing our layer into a ResNet-18 architecture allows keeping consistent high performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet even when training starts from poor random stride configurations. Moreover, formulating strides as learnable variables allows us to introduce a regularization term that controls the computational complexity of the architecture. We show how this regularization allows trading off accuracy for efficiency on ImageNet.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Generalized Depthwise-Separable Convolutions for Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Hassan Dbouk, Naresh R Shanbhag*\n\n**TL;DR:** The method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution is proposed -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution that dramatically improves the throughput of aStandard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their tremendous successes, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) incur high computational/storage costs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent works on robust model compression address these challenges by combining model compression techniques with adversarial training. But these methods are unable to improve throughput (frames-per-second) on real-life hardware while simultaneously preserving robustness to adversarial perturbations. To overcome this problem, we propose the method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution. GDWS dramatically improves the throughput of a standard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness. Lastly, GDWS is scalable to large problem sizes since it operates on pre-trained models and doesn't require any additional training. We establish the optimality of GDWS as a 2D convolution approximator and present exact algorithms for constructing optimal GDWS convolutions under complexity and error constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDWS via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets.

Channel Gating Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Zhiru Zhang, Yuan Zhou, Weizhe Hua, Christopher De Sa, G. Edward Suh*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions. Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks achieves 2.7-8.0$\\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 2.0-4.4$\\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either FPGAs or ASICs.

Given a specification of a convolutional neural network, our goal is\nto minimize the time to train this model on a cluster of commodity CPUs and\nGPUs. We first focus on the single-node setting and show that by using standard\nbatching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least\n5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training\nspeed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its\nunderlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black\nbox. Our second contribution is a theoretical and empirical study of the\ntradeoffs affecting end-to-end training time in a multiple-device setting. We\nidentify the degree of asynchronous parallelization as a key factor affecting\nboth hardware and statistical efficiency. We see that asynchrony can be viewed\nas introducing a momentum term. Our results imply that tuning momentum is\ncritical in asynchronous parallel configurations, and suggest that published\nresults that have not been fully tuned might report suboptimal performance for\nsome configurations. For our third contribution, we use our novel understanding\nof the interaction between system and optimization dynamics to provide an\nefficient hyperparameter optimizer. Our optimizer involves a predictive model\nfor the total time to convergence and selects an allocation of resources to\nminimize that time. We demonstrate that the most popular distributed deep\nlearning systems fall within our tradeoff space, but do not optimize within the\nspace. By doing this optimization, our prototype runs 1.9x to 12x faster than\nthe fastest state-of-the-art systems.\n\n**Published:** 2016-06-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. NASCaps: A Framework for Neural Architecture Search to Optimize the Accuracy and Hardware Efficiency of Convolutional Capsule Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization dynamic convolutions neural networks*\n\n*Beatrice Bussolino, Muhammad Shafique, Maurizio Martina, Vojtech Mrazek, Andrea Massa, Alberto Marchisio*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant improvements to reach the desired accuracy to be employed in a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) applications. Recently the Google Brain's team demonstrated the ability of Capsule Networks (CapsNets) to encode and learn spatial correlations between different input features, thereby obtaining superior learning capabilities compared to traditional (i.e., non-capsule based) DNNs. However, designing CapsNets using conventional methods is a tedious job and incurs significant training effort. Recent studies have shown that powerful methods to automatically select the best/optimal DNN model configuration for a given set of applications and a training dataset are based on the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. Moreover, due to their extreme computational and memory requirements, DNNs are employed using the specialized hardware accelerators in IoT-Edge/CPS devices. In this paper, we propose NASCaps, an automated framework for the hardware-aware NAS of different types of DNNs, covering both traditional convolutional DNNs and CapsNets. We study the efficacy of deploying a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (e.g., based on the NSGA-II algorithm). The proposed framework can jointly optimize the network accuracy and the corresponding hardware efficiency, expressed in terms of energy, memory, and latency of a given hardware accelerator executing the DNN inference. Besides supporting the traditional DNN layers, our framework is the first to model and supports the specialized capsule layers and dynamic routing in the NAS-flow. We evaluate our framework on different datasets, generating different network configurations, and demonstrate the tradeoffs between the different output metrics. We will open-source the complete framework and configurations of the Pareto-optimal architectures at https://github.com/ehw-fit/nascaps.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using dynamic convolutions, focusing on hardware optimization, memory access patterns, cache utilization, parallel processing, and integration with existing architectures, here are some key insights and strategies derived from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques\n\n### Specialized Hardware Designs\nHardware implementations can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of neural networks, including those using dynamic convolutions. For instance, using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can allow for highly parallelized computations, reducing redundant operations and memory accesses. This approach can lead to lower power consumption and higher throughput, as seen in the design of optimized MLP neural networks with approximate MAC units.\n\n### Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\nSNNs offer a promising avenue for energy efficiency by encoding and processing information using spikes, which can lead to sparsity in model realization and higher energy efficiencies. The hardware-software co-optimization strategy for SNNs can be adapted for dynamic convolutions, ensuring fast and accurate inference with reduced precision, which is crucial for efficient hardware implementation.\n\n### Approximate Computing\nEmploying approximate computing techniques, such as using approximate multipliers with configurable error and power, can reduce hardware area and power consumption while maintaining reasonable accuracy. This method can be integrated into the MAC units of dynamic convolutional layers to enhance efficiency.\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Cache Utilization\n\n### Efficient Data Supply Strategies\nOptimized mapping mechanisms and efficient data supply strategies can improve memory access patterns. For example, in CNN accelerators, using a combination of feature reduction and resource-saving techniques can minimize data transfer time and optimize cache utilization. This can be applied to dynamic convolutions by ensuring that the data is accessed in a manner that maximizes cache hits and minimizes memory latency.\n\n### Hierarchical Feature Extraction\nIn CNNs, hierarchical feature extraction using convolutional layers can be optimized to reduce spatial dimensions of feature maps, which improves efficiency and accuracy. A similar hierarchical approach can be applied to dynamic convolutions, ensuring that the memory access patterns are optimized for each layer, reducing the need for frequent memory accesses.\n\n## Parallel Processing Capabilities\n\n### Parallel Computation Architectures\nDesigns that facilitate parallel computation, such as those using multiplexed physical layers or reconfigurable processing elements, can significantly enhance the performance of dynamic convolutions. These architectures allow for concurrent execution of operations, leading to improved throughput and reduced execution clock cycles.\n\n### SIMT (Single-Instruction Multiple Threads)\nUtilizing Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) in GPUs, which operate on the SIMT paradigm, can efficiently handle the parallel computations required by dynamic convolutions. This approach divides computations into general-purpose cores that can handle multiple threads simultaneously, making it suitable for the linear complexity of dynamic convolutions.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n### Reduced Precision Representation\nConverting software-trained full-precision models to reduced-precision representations, such as those used in SNNs, can be highly effective for hardware implementation. This approach maintains accuracy while reducing the computational and memory requirements, making it suitable for dynamic convolutions.\n\n### Reconfigurable Processing Elements\nDesigning reconfigurable processing elements, such as those consisting of multiplexers and adders, can avoid expensive multipliers and optimize the processing of convolutional kernels. This reconfigurability can support various kernel sizes and fully-connected layers, making it adaptable for dynamic convolutions.\n\n## Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n### Hybrid Approaches\nCombining dynamic convolutions with other mechanisms, such as self-attention or residual connections, can enhance the performance and efficiency of autoregressive models. Hybrid approaches can balance local and global processing, ensuring that the model leverages the strengths of each component[Analysis Note].\n\n### Domain Decomposition\nFor complex tasks, a domain decomposition approach can be used to break down the problem into simpler subdomains. This method, similar to that used in fluid flow predictions, can help in integrating dynamic convolutions with existing architectures by decoupling the computations into manageable parts.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop highly efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage dynamic convolutions, optimized for both performance and hardware efficiency.\n",

Transformers rely on a trainable attention mechanism that identifies complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence. Unfortunately, the regular Transformer scales quadratically with the number of tokens $L$ in the input sequence, which is prohibitively expensive for large $L$ and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources even for moderate values of $L$. Several solutions have been proposed to address this issue (Beltagy et al., 2020, Gulati et al., 2020, Chan et al. 2020, Child et al. 2019, Bello et al., 2019). Most approaches restrict the attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods (Parmar et al. 2018) or incorporate structural priors on attention such as sparsity (Child et al., 2019), pooling-based compression (Rae et al, 2020) clustering/binning/convolution techniques (e.g. (Roy et al., 2020) which applies $k$-means clustering to learn dynamic sparse attention regions, or (Kitaev et al. 2020), where locality sensitive hashing is used to group together tokens of similar embeddings), sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020), or truncated targeting (Chelba et al. 2020). There is also a long line of research on using dense attention matrices, but defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax (Katharopoulos et al. 2020. Shen et al., 2018). Those methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors. The approaches above do not aim to approximate regular attention, but rather propose simpler and more tractable attention mechanisms, often by incorporating additional constraints (e.g. identical query and key sets as in (Kitaev et al. 2020) , or by trading regular with sparse attention using more\n\n[^0]layers (Child et al., 2019). Unfortunately, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods, and sometimes the validity of sparsity patterns can only be verified empirically through trial and error by constructing special GPU operations (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nSequence modeling has seen some great breakthroughs through recent years with the introduction of the use of neural networks. Recurrent neural network methods (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), convolution methods (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), and self-attention approaches (Paulus et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020) have all yielded state-ofthe-art results in various NLP tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; Britz et al., 2017; Aharoni et al., 2019), language modeling (Sundermeyer et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2016; Devlin\n\n[^0]et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019), automatic summarization (Paulus et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2018; Celikyilmaz et al., 2018), named entity recognition (Lample et al., 2016; Devlin et al., 2019) and sentiment analysis (Xu et al., 2016; Sachan et al., 2019). Seemingly all modern approaches of sequence encoding rely on the use of attention to \"filter\" the excessive information given at a current time-step. Attention can be expressed as the weighted sum over context representations using attention weights that are usually generated from the context representations (self-attention) (Cheng et al., 2016). The transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017) assigns attention weights for a given time-step to all available context token representations, while the newly proposed dynamic convolution (Wu et al., 2019) only computes an attention over a fixed context window. Self-attention over all context tokens is computationally very expensive. Specifically, the transformer network has a time complexity of $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ where $n$ is the length of the input sequence. Thus, modeling long-range dependencies becomes very challenging and the practicality of the selfattention method has been questioned. The more recent approach of dynamic convolutions (Wu et al., 2019) successfully reduced the time complexity to $O(k \\cdot n)$ where $k$ is the kernel size specified for each layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of adaptive convolution, Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) convolutions, that learns the kernel size of a summation kernel for each time-step instead of learning the kernel weights as in a typical convolution operation.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces (Avg.

Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/45 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03499, 2016.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving outstanding results in various tasks such as speech recognition (Dong et al., 2018), machine translation (Wang et al., 2019), and document generation/summarization (Kim et al., 2022). This success has led to an era dominated by large language models (LLMs), where the Transformer\n\n[^0]Preprint. structure is scaled up to handle increasingly complex tasks. However, this scaling brings with it substantial computational demands, especially due to the attention mechanism which requires cross-correlation calculations between each token. These computational requirements, coupled with the significant inference costs and energy consumption, present considerable obstacles to deploying these models in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and robotics. In response to the pressing need for more efficient Transformer models, the research community has directed its efforts towards optimizing the Transformer architecture. A myriad of strategies has been put forward, encompassing methods such as model pruning, quantization, and the development of more efficient attention mechanisms. Among these initiatives, simplifying the attention mechanism has emerged as a particularly promising avenue. This approach focuses on transforming the traditionally quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms into a more manageable linear scale. (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) introduces Linear Transformers, which leverage kernel feature maps to transform self-attention, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear while maintaining comparable results to traditional Transformers. (Kitaev et al., 2020) proposes replacies dotproduct attention with locality-sensitive hashing and using reversible residual layers to minimize memory usage in training. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) utilize positive orthogonal random features to approximate softmax-based self-attention in Transformers, achieving a transformative leap to linear complexity. However, the majority of existing methods for optimizing Transformers, particularly in relation to their attention mechanisms, necessitate comprehensive retraining. This retraining process presents a formidable challenge, especially for models with an immense array of parameters. It requires a significant investment in terms of computational resources and time. For instance, the training of a large model like LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) demands approximately 82,432 GPU-hours and incurs a total power consumption of around 36 MWh . Undertaking such extensive retraining for models of this magnitude is not only economically taxing but also raises environmental concerns due to the substantial\nenergy expenditure involved. This underscores the need for more efficient approaches to adapt and optimize these largescale models. Undertaking such extensive retraining for models of this magnitude is not only economically taxing but also raises environmental concerns due to the substantial energy expenditure involved. Despite few research (Zheng et al., 2023; Choromanski et al., 2020) efforts focusing on finding fast approximations for attention mechanisms, these methods have not been thoroughly validated in large-scale language models. To address the issue of fast attention approximations in large language models, we conducted a thorough analysis of existing linear attention schemes. We discovered that the main source of approximation error in these methods is due to sampling based on the Monte Carlo method. Consequently, we propose the use of weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling for mapping, specifically introducing Frequency Domain Kernelization. This approach efficiently and accurately maps the queries and keys of a Transformer to the frequency domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This mapping allows us to effectively eliminate the softmax operation in the attention mechanism, rendering the attention computation linear in complexity, which is shown in Figure 1. We theoretically demonstrate that this frequency domain mapping is an approximate equivalent to the original attention mechanism. Our experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer with a significantly smaller training cost $(<1 / 10)$, while also benefiting from faster inference speeds (up to about 10x). ## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Linear Transformers\n\nReducing the computational load of attention in Transformers remains a hot topic in research. (Child et al., 2019) achieved this by sparsifying attention, thereby reducing its computational cost. Similarly, (Kitaev et al., 2020) used locality-sensitive hashing to expedite the computation of attention. However, these methods are hard to apply in auto-regressive Transformer models. As a result, there has been a series of works focusing on removing or substituting the softmax in attention. Notably, the Linear Transformer, first introduced by (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), represents a significant stride in this direction. (Qin et al., 2022) approximated attention calculations using a linear operator and a cosine-based distance reweighting. (Zhai et al., 2021) achieved linear complexity in Transformers by preprocessing keys and values. (Lu et al., 2021) used Gaussian kernel functions in place of dot-product similarity, allowing for the approximation of the full self-attention matrix through low-rank matrix decomposition. (Bello, 2021) bypassed the need for attention calculations by capturing interactions through transforming available contexts into linear functions and applying them to each input, showcasing the variety of methods explored to optimize attention mechanisms in Transformer models. Additionally, recent proposals like RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) have introduced potential alternatives to the Transformer with linear complexity. However, these existing improvements typically require significant modifications to the model's architecture and often necessitate training a new model from scratch to achieve optimal performance. Given the substantial training costs associated with large language models, such retraining is not always feasible. While methods like StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) or Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) can be implemented through fine-tuning, their reliance on window attention compromises their ability to truly model long sequences, leading to a decrease in accuracy. This highlights the challenge of balancing model training efficiency with the ability to maintain high performance in handling long sequences. ### 2.2. Frequency-based Transformers\n\nA various of research has focused on applying the Transformer architecture in the frequency domain. For instance, FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2021) replaces the self-attention in BERT with Fourier Transform, significantly speeding up Transformer computations. A similar concept (Buchholz \\& Jug, 2022) has been adapted for image processing tasks. DCFormer (Li et al., 2023) proposes a Transformerbased network that learns semantic representations directly from frequency domain representations using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). In the realm of video prediction, ideas like the local frequency domain transformer (Farazi et al., 2021) have been introduced. However, applying these concepts to existing decoder-only large language models presents challenges. The auto-regressive inference style of these models makes token-level frequency domain transformations cumbersome. Each new token requires frequency domain transformation in conjunction with all previous tokens, which fails to reduce complexity and undermines the potential efficiency gains of frequency domain approaches in large-scale language models. ## 3. Kernelized Attention in Frequency Domain\n\nIn our study, we begin by revisiting the general form of selfattention (Vaswani et al., 2017). To simplify the notation and focus on the core aspects, we consider the single head form of self-attention and omit normalization factors. The self-attention mechanism is fundamentally composed of\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_7edc096661daf8d487e6g-03.jpg?height=632&width=1676&top_left_y=210&top_left_x=214)\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the proposed method, where the computation of queries and keys in the attention mechanism of a Transformer is efficiently mapped to the frequency domain using a fast Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This mapping effectively eliminates the softmax operation, thereby substantially reducing the computational complexity of the Transformer. queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$, expressed in the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) V \\\\\n& \\text { where } Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ denotes the number of tokens and $d$ denotes the hidden dimension of the attention. Specifically, when we denote $Q$ as $\\left(q_{1}, q_{2}, \\ldots, q_{n}\\right), K$ as $\\left(k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{n}\\right), V$ as $\\left(v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$, and output $O$ as $\\left(o_{1}, o_{2}, \\ldots, o_{n}\\right)$, Equation 1 can be reformulated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& o_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{q_{i} k_{j}^{\\top}}}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=1}^{n} e^{q_{i} k_{j^{\\prime}}^{\\top}}} v_{j} \\\\\n& \\text { where } q_{i}, k_{i}, v_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}, i=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt can be observed that the computational and memory complexity for calculating each output in a Transformer model is $\\mathcal{O}(n d)$, where $n$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation. Consequently, the time and memory complexity for processing a sentence of length $n$ scales quadratically, becoming $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. This quadratic scaling poses a significant computational burden, particularly for longer sequences where $n$ is large, making processing resource-intensive and challenging. To mitigate this complexity, the concept of a kernel mechanism has been introduced as a means to reduce the computational demands of attention mechanisms, which has been introduced in (Tsai et al., 2019; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020). Specifically, this involves the introduction of a kernel function $K(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, which acts as a positive-definite kernel capable of measuring similarity. By utilizing this kernel, the attention mechanism can be reformulated as:\n\n$$\no_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{K\\left(q_{i}, k_{j}\\right)}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=1}^{n} \\mathcal{K}\\left(q_{i}, k_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)} v_{j}\n$$\n\nBy applying the kernel trick, it's possible to linearly decompose the attention mechanism:\n\n$$\no_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\phi\\left(q_{i}\\right) \\phi\\left(k_{j}\\right)^{\\top}}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=1}^{n} \\phi\\left(q_{i}\\right) \\phi\\left(k_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)^{\\top}} v_{j}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi(\\cdot): \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a projection to map the inputs into $m$ dimension features. This decomposition benefits from the fact that the computational dimensions of the keys and values can be merged, effectively reducing the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n m d)$. Given that the dimensionality $d$ and $m$ is typically much smaller than the sequence length $n$, this linearization of the attention mechanism results in a substantial decrease in computational intensity. In the context of large language models, the cost of retraining is prohibitively high. In such scenarios, it becomes imperative to find a kernel that can equivalently replace the vanilla attention mechanism without necessitating extensive retraining. Positive Random Features (PRF) (Choromanski et al., 2020) emerge as a viable candidate in this regard:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{PRF}}(x)=e^{\\omega x^{\\top}-\\frac{\\|x\\|^{2}}{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$. Theoretical demonstrations have established that $e^{q k^{\\top}}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\omega \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0 . I)}\\left[e^{\\omega q^{\\top}-\\frac{\\|q\\|^{2}}{2}} e^{\\omega k^{\\top}-\\frac{\\|k\\|^{2}}{2}}\\right]$. It means that when $m$, the dimension of the feature space, is sufficiently large, Positive Random Features (PRF) mapping becomes an equivalent of the original attention mechanism. This equivalence suggests that, in theory, it is feasible to directly transform existing vanilla attention into linear attention using PRF mapping, thereby achieving an acceleration without loss of functionality. However, a notable challenge arises due to the need for $m$ to be set to a significantly large value to maintain the performance by reducing the approximation error. This requirement leads to a non-negligible increase in computational demand. For instance, in the case of the Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), to achieve a lossless linear attention, $m$ often needs to be set to larger than $d$, diminishing the benefits of reduced computational load brought by linear attention. To address this issue, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the kernel-based approach for approximating attention mechanisms. We begin with the application of Bochner's Theorem. This theorem allows us to equate the original attention computation involving queries $(\\mathrm{Q})$ and keys $(\\mathrm{K})-$ specifically the Gaussian kernel - to an integral computation akin to Equation 4. Theorem 3.1. (Bochner's Theorem) (Feller, 1966). A continuous shift invariant scaled kernel function $K(x, z)$ : $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow R$ is positive definite if and only if it is the Fourier Transform of a unique finite probability measure $p$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n```\n\n#### 5.

RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: dynamic kernel generation neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Dynamics of Finite Width Kernel and Prediction Fluctuations in Mean Field Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kernel generation neural networks*\n\n*Blake Bordelon, C. Pehlevan*\n\n**TL;DR:** In two layer networks, it is demonstrated that large learning rate phenomena such as edge of stability effects can be well captured by infinite width dynamics and that initialization variance can decrease dynamically.\n\n**Abstract:** \n We analyze the dynamics of finite width effects in wide but finite feature learning neural networks. Starting from a dynamical mean field theory description of infinite width deep neural network kernel and prediction dynamics, we provide a characterization of the \n \n \n \n \n O\n \n (\n 1\n \n /\n \n \n width\n \n )\n \n \n fluctuations of the dynamical mean field theory order parameters over random initializations of the network weights. Our results, while perturbative in width, unlike prior analyses, are non-perturbative in the strength of feature learning. We find that once the mean field/\u00b5P parameterization is adopted, the leading finite size effect on the dynamics is to introduce initialization variance in the predictions and feature kernels of the networks. In the lazy limit of network training, all kernels are random but static in time and the prediction variance has a universal form. However, in the rich, feature learning regime, the fluctuations of the kernels and predictions are dynamically coupled with a variance that can be computed self-consistently. In two layer networks, we show how feature learning can dynamically reduce the variance of the final tangent kernel and final network predictions. We also show how initialization variance can slow down online learning in wide but finite networks. In deeper networks, kernel variance can dramatically accumulate through subsequent layers at large feature learning strengths, but feature learning continues to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the feature kernels. In discrete time, we demonstrate that large learning rate phenomena such as edge of stability effects can be well captured by infinite width dynamics and that initialization variance can decrease dynamically. For convolutional neural networks trained on CIFAR-10, we empirically find significant corrections to both the bias and variance of network dynamics due to finite width.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

However, they are also known for being slow in inference, which makes them challenging to deploy in real-time applications. We propose a switchable decision to accelerate inference by dynamically assigning computation resources for each data instance. Automatically making decisions on where to skip and how to balance quality and computation cost with constrained optimization, our dynamic neural generation networks enforce the efficient inference path and determine the optimized trade-off. Experiments across question answering, summarization, and classification benchmarks show that our method benefits from less computation cost during inference while keeping the same accuracy.

Self-consistent dynamical field theory of kernel evolution in wide neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kernel generation neural networks*\n\n*Blake Bordelon, C. Pehlevan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work constructs a collection of deterministic dynamical order parameters which are inner-product kernels for hidden unit activations and gradients in each layer at pairs of time points, providing a reduced description of network activity through training.\n\n**Abstract:** We analyze feature learning in infinite-width neural networks trained with gradient flow through a self-consistent dynamical field theory. We construct a collection of deterministic dynamical order parameters which are inner-product kernels for hidden unit activations and gradients in each layer at pairs of time points, providing a reduced description of network activity through training. These kernel order parameters collectively define the hidden layer activation distribution, the evolution of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and consequently, output predictions. We show that the field theory derivation recovers the recursive stochastic process of infinite-width feature learning networks obtained by Yang and Hu with tensor programs. For deep linear networks, these kernels satisfy a set of algebraic matrix equations. For nonlinear networks, we provide an alternating sampling procedure to self-consistently solve for the kernel order parameters. We provide comparisons of the self-consistent solution to various approximation schemes including the static NTK approximation, gradient independence assumption, and leading order perturbation theory, showing that each of these approximations can break down in regimes where general self-consistent solutions still provide an accurate description. Lastly, we provide experiments in more realistic settings which demonstrate that the loss and kernel dynamics of convolutional neural networks at fixed feature learning strength are preserved across different widths on a image classification task.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Learning from partially labeled data for multi-organ and tumor segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kernel generation neural networks*\n\n*Chunhua Shen, Yong Xia, Jianpeng Zhang, Yutong Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** Medical image benchmarks for the segmentation of organs and tumors suffer from the partially labeling issue due to its intensive cost of labor and expertise. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network solving one task. With this pipeline, not only the performance is limited by the typically small dataset of a single task, but also the computation cost linearly increases with the number of tasks. To address this, we propose a Transformer based dynamic on-demand network (TransDoDNet) that learns to segment organs and tumors on multiple partially labeled datasets. Specifically, TransDoDNet has a hybrid backbone that is composed of the convolutional neural network and Transformer. A dynamic head enables the network to accomplish multiple segmentation tasks flexibly. Unlike existing approaches that fix kernels after training, the kernels in the dynamic head are generated adaptively by the Transformer, which employs the self-attention mechanism to model long-range organ-wise dependencies and decodes the organ embedding that can represent each organ. We create a large-scale partially labeled Multi-Organ and Tumor Segmentation benchmark, termed MOTS, and demonstrate the superior performance of our TransDoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. This study also provides a general 3D medical image segmentation model, which has been pre-trained on the large-scale MOTS benchmark and has demonstrated advanced performance over BYOL, the current predominant self-supervised learning method.

Learning Guided Convolutional Network for Depth Completion\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kernel generation neural networks*\n\n*Fei-Peng Tian, Ping Tan, Jie Tang, Jian Li, Wei Feng*\n\n**Abstract:** Dense depth perception is critical for autonomous driving and other robotics applications. However, modern LiDAR sensors only provide sparse depth measurement. It is thus necessary to complete the sparse LiDAR data, where a synchronized guidance RGB image is often used to facilitate this completion. Many neural networks have been designed for this task. However, they often na\\\"{\\i}vely fuse the LiDAR data and RGB image information by performing feature concatenation or element-wise addition. Inspired by the guided image filtering, we design a novel guided network to predict kernel weights from the guidance image. These predicted kernels are then applied to extract the depth image features. In this way, our network generates content-dependent and spatially-variant kernels for multi-modal feature fusion. Dynamically generated spatially-variant kernels could lead to prohibitive GPU memory consumption and computation overhead. We further design a convolution factorization to reduce computation and memory consumption. The GPU memory reduction makes it possible for feature fusion to work in multi-stage scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method on real-world outdoor, indoor and synthetic datasets. Our method produces strong results. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NYUv2 dataset and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission. It also presents strong generalization capability under different 3D point densities, various lighting and weather conditions as well as cross-dataset evaluations.

Recurrent Pixel Embedding for Instance Grouping\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kernel generation neural networks*\n\n*Charless Fowlkes, Shu Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a differentiable, end-to-end trainable framework for solving\npixel-level grouping problems such as instance segmentation consisting of two\nnovel components. First, we regress pixels into a hyper-spherical embedding\nspace so that pixels from the same group have high cosine similarity while\nthose from different groups have similarity below a specified margin. We\nanalyze the choice of embedding dimension and margin, relating them to\ntheoretical results on the problem of distributing points uniformly on the\nsphere. Second, to group instances, we utilize a variant of mean-shift\nclustering, implemented as a recurrent neural network parameterized by kernel\nbandwidth. This recurrent grouping module is differentiable, enjoys convergent\ndynamics and probabilistic interpretability. Backpropagating the group-weighted\nloss through this module allows learning to focus on only correcting embedding\nerrors that won't be resolved during subsequent clustering. Our framework,\nwhile conceptually simple and theoretically abundant, is also practically\neffective and computationally efficient. We demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over state-of-the-art instance segmentation for object proposal\ngeneration, as well as demonstrating the benefits of grouping loss for\nclassification tasks such as boundary detection and semantic segmentation.\n\n**Conference:** recurrent-pixel-embedding-for-instance-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-12-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using dynamic kernel generation techniques, here are some key points and methods to consider:\n\n## Methods for Generating Dynamic Kernels\n\n1. **Dynamic Convolutional Layers**:\n   Dynamic convolutional layers can be generated using methods that adapt the kernel weights based on the input data. For example, the \"Short-Long Convolutions\" approach uses tiling and hierarchy to implement linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, which can be adapted for dynamic kernel generation.\n\n2. **Attention Mechanisms**:\n   Integrating attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer architectures, can help in generating dynamic kernels. The weights of the attention mechanism can be seen as dynamic kernels that change based on the input context.\n\n3. **Meta-Learning**:\n   Meta-learning techniques can be employed to generate dynamic kernels. For instance, a meta-network can be trained to produce the weights of the kernels based on the input data, allowing for dynamic adaptation during inference.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n1. **Kernel Fusion**:\n   Techniques like kernel fusion, as mentioned in \"FlashFFTConv\" and \"Monarch Mixer,\" can significantly reduce computational overhead by combining multiple operations into a single step. This approach minimizes the number of memory accesses and improves hardware utilization.\n\n2. **Matrix Decomposition**:\n   Using matrix decomposition to compute convolutions, as in \"FlashFFTConv,\" can optimize the use of specialized matrix multiply units, reducing the computational cost and improving efficiency.\n\n3. **Parallel Processing**:\n   Leveraging parallel processing capabilities, especially on modern hardware like GPUs and TPUs, can accelerate the computation of dynamic kernels. This can be achieved through careful optimization of memory access patterns and the use of hierarchical processing strategies.\n\n## Memory Requirements\n\n1. **Tiling Strategies**:\n   Implementing tiling strategies can improve cache utilization, reducing the memory footprint and the need for frequent memory accesses. This is particularly effective in hierarchical processing architectures.\n\n2. **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**:\n   Optimizing the memory hierarchy by minimizing data movement between different levels of memory (e.g., using kernel fusion) can significantly reduce memory requirements and improve overall performance.\n\n## Training Considerations\n\n1. **Training Stability**:\n   Training models with dynamic kernels can be challenging due to stability issues. Techniques such as gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and careful initialization can help stabilize the training process. Additionally, using meta-learning or attention mechanisms can provide more stable and adaptive kernel generation.\n\n2. **Regularization Techniques**:\n   Regularization techniques, such as weight decay or dropout, can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of models with dynamic kernels. These techniques are particularly important when the model has a large number of parameters that need to be learned.\n\n## Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n1. **Transformer Architectures**:\n   Dynamic kernel generation can be integrated into Transformer architectures by using attention mechanisms to generate dynamic weights. This approach has been successful in various natural language processing tasks and can be adapted for autoregressive models.\n\n2. **Autoregressive Models**:\n   Autoregressive models, such as those based on the Transformer architecture, can be modified to include dynamic kernel generation.

By modifying the Conv GAU to include dynamic convolutions, the model can adaptively capture both local and long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency and compatibility with the existing architecture.```\n\n```selection Conv```\n\n# DynamicConvTTT\n\n## Motivation\n\nModern language models face challenges in efficiently modeling long-range dependencies, particularly when processing long sequences. While attention mechanisms like self-attention in Transformers effectively capture global context, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, leading to inefficiency in handling long sequences. The seed design employs a Conv GAU that uses conventional convolutions, which have limited adaptability and may not efficiently capture long-range dependencies.\n\nDynamic convolution offers a promising solution by generating input-dependent kernels that adaptively focus on relevant features at each time step. Integrating dynamic convolution into the Conv GAU can enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies, improve efficiency through linear computational complexity, and maintain the autoregressive property crucial for language modeling.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Dynamic Convolutions**: Wu et al. (2019) introduced dynamic convolutions that predict separate convolution kernels for each time step based solely on the current input, enabling efficient context modeling with linear complexity.\n\n- **Hybrid Attention-Convolution Models**: Kim et al. (2024) proposed hybrid networks combining dynamic convolution with self-attention to leverage the strengths of both mechanisms in sequence modeling.\n\n- **LoCoCo**: Chen et al. (2024) introduced LoCoCo, which uses dynamic convolution for long context compression in large language models, demonstrating efficiency gains and improved attention modeling.\n\nThese works highlight the effectiveness of dynamic convolution in enhancing model performance and efficiency, particularly in handling long sequences. By integrating dynamic convolution into the Conv GAU, we aim to leverage these benefits within the seed design.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Challenges\n\n1. **Inefficient Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: Conventional convolutions in the Conv GAU have fixed kernels and limited receptive fields, making it challenging to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n2. **Computational Complexity**: Attention mechanisms like self-attention have quadratic computational complexity, leading to inefficiency in processing long sequences.\n\n3. **Adaptability**: Static convolution kernels lack adaptability to input variations, reducing the model's ability to focus on relevant features dynamically.\n\n### Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nWe propose modifying the Conv GAU to integrate dynamic convolution, creating **DynamicConvTTT**. The core ideas include:\n\n- **Dynamic Kernel Generation**: Implement a kernel generation module that produces input-dependent convolution kernels at each time step, allowing the model to adaptively focus on relevant features.\n\n- **Causal Dynamic Convolutions**: Use causal convolutions to maintain the autoregressive property, ensuring that the model does not access future tokens.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Maintain linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length, improving efficiency in processing long sequences.\n\n- **Compatibility with Existing Architecture**: Integrate seamlessly with the seed design, ensuring compatibility and ease of adoption.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\n1. **Dynamic Convolution Operation**:\n\n   For input sequence \\( X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_T] \\), the output at time step \\( t \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   y_t = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_t(k) \\cdot x_{t - k + 1}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( w_t(k) \\) is the dynamic kernel at time step \\( t \\) generated based on \\( x_t \\).\n\n2. **Kernel Generation Function**:\n\n   \\[\n   w_t = \\text{Softmax}(W_k \\cdot x_t + b_k)\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( W_k \\) and \\( b_k \\) are learnable parameters, and the Softmax ensures the kernel weights sum to one.\n\n3. **Maintaining Autoregressive Property**:\n\n   By using causal convolutions (zero-padding future positions), we ensure that \\( y_t \\) depends only on \\( x_{\\leq t} \\).\n\n### Trade-offs and Solutions\n\n- **Computational Overhead of Kernel Generation**: The dynamic kernel generation introduces additional computations. We mitigate this by designing a lightweight kernel generation network and sharing parameters where appropriate.\n\n- **Training Stability**: The added complexity may affect training stability. We address this by incorporating proper normalization (e.g., LayerNorm) and activation functions (e.g., GELU), as well as employing regularization techniques like dropout.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\nWe have chosen to modify the ```Conv``` GAU.\n\n### Modifications Overview\n\n1. **Integrate Dynamic Convolution**:\n\n   -

Apply the generated kernel to the past \\( K \\) inputs.\n\n   \\[\n   y_t = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_t(k) \\cdot x_{t - k + 1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Causal Implementation**:\n\n   - Pad the input sequence appropriately to ensure causality.\n\n4. **Normalization and Activation**:\n\n   -

k + 1}))\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Parameter Definitions**:\n\n   - \\( W_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times D} \\): Weight matrix for kernel generation.\n   - \\( b_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K} \\): Bias vector for kernel generation.\n   -

The dynamic kernels allow the model to adaptively focus on relevant features at each time step, improving performance on long-sequence tasks. The approach maintains linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length, ensuring scalability and efficiency in both training and inference. Additionally, the modification is confined within the Conv GAU, making it compatible with the existing architecture and facilitating ease of integration.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Wu, F., Fan, A., Baevski, A., Dauphin, Y.
