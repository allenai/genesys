Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.32)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nY.

LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2. PuMer: Pruning and Merging Tokens for Efficient Vision Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Qingqing Cao, Bhargavi Paranjape, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*\n\n**TL;DR:** PuMer is a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale vision language (VL) models use Transformers to perform cross-modal interactions between the input text and image. These cross-modal interactions are computationally expensive and memory-intensive due to the quadratic complexity of processing the input image and text. We present PuMer: a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint. PuMer learns to keep salient image tokens related to the input text and merges similar textual and visual tokens by adding lightweight token reducer modules at several cross-modal layers in the VL model. Training PuMer is mostly the same as finetuning the original VL model but faster. Our evaluation for two vision language models on four downstream VL tasks shows PuMer increases inference throughput by up to 2x and reduces memory footprint by over 50% while incurring less than a 1% accuracy drop.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Pushdown Layers: Encoding Recursive Structure in Transformer Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursion is a prominent feature of human language, and fundamentally challenging for self-attention due to the lack of an explicit recursive-state tracking mechanism. Consequently, Transformer language models poorly capture long-tail recursive structure and exhibit sample-inefficient syntactic generalization. This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix. Transformer LMs with Pushdown Layers are syntactic language models that autoregressively and synchronously update this stack tape as they predict new tokens, in turn using the stack tape to softly modulate attention over tokens -- for instance, learning to\"skip\"over closed constituents. When trained on a corpus of strings annotated with silver constituency parses, Transformers equipped with Pushdown Layers achieve dramatically better and 3-5x more sample-efficient syntactic generalization, while maintaining similar perplexities. Pushdown Layers are a drop-in replacement for standard self-attention. We illustrate this by finetuning GPT2-medium with Pushdown Layers on an automatically parsed WikiText-103, leading to improvements on several GLUE text classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the property of convolutional neural networks, as well as a generic method to improve the performance of many CNN architectures. Specifically, we first examine existing CNN models and observe an intriguing property that the filters in the lower layers form pairs (i.e., filters with opposite phase). Inspired by our observation, we propose a novel, simple yet effective activation scheme called concatenated ReLU (CRelu) and theoretically analyze its reconstruction property in CNNs. We integrate CRelu into several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and demonstrate improvement in their recognition performance on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets with fewer trainable parameters. Our results suggest that better understanding of the properties of CNNs can lead to significant performance improvement with a simple modification.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 484  (*Influential: 44*)\n\n#### 5. Blockwise Parallel Decoding for Deep Autoregressive Models\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional autoregressive units improvements*\n\n*Mitchell Stern, Noam M.

While common architecture classes such as recurrent, convolutional, and self-attention networks make different trade-offs between the amount of computation needed per layer and the length of the critical path at training time, generation still remains an inherently sequential process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel blockwise parallel decoding scheme in which we make predictions for multiple time steps in parallel then back off to the longest prefix validated by a scoring model. This allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequences in parallel. We verify our approach empirically through a series of experiments using state-of-the-art self-attention models for machine translation and image super-resolution, achieving iteration reductions of up to 2x over a baseline greedy decoder with no loss in quality, or up to 7x in exchange for a slight decrease in performance. In terms of wall-clock time, our fastest models exhibit real-time speedups of up to 4x over standard greedy decoding.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 162  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 6. MaCow: Masked Convolutional Generative Flow\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional autoregressive units improvements*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, E. Hovy*\n\n**TL;DR:** MaCow is introduced, a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution, which achieves significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Abstract:** Flow-based generative models, conceptually attractive due to tractability of both the exact log-likelihood computation and latent-variable inference, and efficiency of both training and sampling, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many advanced variants and theoretical investigations. Despite their computational efficiency, the density estimation performance of flow-based generative models significantly falls behind those of state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this work, we introduce masked convolutional generative flow (MaCow), a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution. By restricting the local connectivity in a small kernel, MaCow enjoys the properties of fast and stable training, and efficient sampling, while achieving significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7.

Moreover, we show that our design incorporates larger neighborhoods compared to SGC thus coping better with oversmoothing. We explain that limiting over-dominance of the largest neighborhoods in the aggregation step is a desired approach to limit oversmoothing while preserving large context of each node. We also show that in spectral analysis that S 2 GC is a trade-off between the low-and high-pass \ufb01lters which leads to capturing the global and local contexts of each node. Moreover, we show how S 2 GC and APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019a) are related and explain why S 2 GC captures a range of neighborhoods better than APPNP.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Binarized Spectral Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Yuan-Yuan Cai, Yuxing Zheng, Jing Lin, Haoqian Wang, X. Yuan, Yulun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that the proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction achieve good performance but require powerful hardwares with enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Noam Shazeer, Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Wojciech Ma\u0144ke, David R. So*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention. Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Kyunghyun Cho, Jiatao Gu, Changhan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Almost all existing machine translation models are built on top of character-based vocabularies: characters, subwords or words. Rare characters from noisy text or character-rich languages such as Japanese and Chinese however can unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness. Representing text at the level of bytes and using the 256 byte set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue. High computational cost has however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. In this paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE), which is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, but is more efficient than using pure bytes only is. We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer. Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE. In the multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages and achieves better translation quality. Moreover, we show that BBPE enables transferring models between languages with non-overlapping character sets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Advancing Parsimonious Deep Learning Weather Prediction using the HEALPix Mesh\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional autoregressive units improvements*\n\n*Martin V. Butz, Noah Brenowitz, Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Dale R. Durran, Raul A. Moreno, Nathaniel Cresswell-Clay, Matthias Karlbauer*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a parsimonious deep learning weather prediction model to forecast seven atmospheric variables with 3-h time resolution for up to one-year lead times on a 110-km global mesh using the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix). In comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) weather forecast models, such as Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP-HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at one-week lead times, its skill is only about one day behind both SOTA ML forecast models and the SOTA numerical weather prediction model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We report several improvements in model design, including switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U-Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U-Net hierarchy. The consistent east-west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location-invariant convolution kernels that successfully propagate weather patterns across the globe without requiring separate kernels for the polar and equatorial faces of the cube sphere. Without any loss of spectral power after the first two days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in one-year simulations.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, Badri Narayana Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

Multi-hop Graph Convolutional Network with High-order Chebyshev Approximation for Text Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Lisai Zhang, Baotian Hu, Xin Liu, Qingcai Chen, Shuoran Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has become popular in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with its superiority in long-term and non-consecutive word interactions. However, existing single-hop graph reasoning in GCN may miss some important non-consecutive dependencies. In this study, we define the spectral graph convolutional network with the high-order dynamic Chebyshev approximation (HDGCN), which augments the multi-hop graph reasoning by fusing messages aggregated from direct and long-term dependencies into one convolutional layer. To alleviate the over-smoothing in high-order Chebyshev approximation, a multi-vote-based cross-attention (MVCAttn) with linear computation complexity is also proposed. The empirical results on four transductive and inductive NLP tasks and the ablation study verify the efficacy of the proposed model.

This approach reduces the number of updated parameters during fine-tuning, making the model more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Advancements in Convolutional Autoregressive Architectures\n\n- **Conformer Models**: The Conformer architecture, which combines the strengths of CNNs and transformers, can be a valuable reference. Conformers use convolutional layers to capture local, fine-grained details and self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. This hybrid approach can be adapted to improve the performance of GAUs in handling both short-term and long-term patterns in sequence data.\n- **Hybrid Transformer Architectures**: The PETAH framework, which adapts hybrid transformer architectures by fine-tuning both attention and convolutional layers, can provide insights into how to optimize the GAU. This approach has shown benefits in vision tasks and could be translated to NLP tasks by adapting the convolutional layers within the GAU.\n\n### Specific Recommendations\n\n1. **Spectral Convolution Integration**:\n   - Explore how spectral convolution techniques can be integrated into the GAU to enhance its ability to capture long-range dependencies. This could involve transforming the input sequence into the frequency domain and applying convolutional operations there.\n\n2. **Efficient Convolutional Layers**:\n   - Implement depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the computational overhead and number of parameters. This can be particularly beneficial for large-scale language models.\n   - Apply layer-wise low-rank decomposition methods like LoRA-C to efficiently fine-tune the GAU, especially when dealing with limited resources.\n\n3. **Hybrid Architectures**:\n   - Investigate the Conformer architecture and its application in sequence modeling. Adapt the hybrid approach of using convolutional layers for local features and self-attention for long-range dependencies to improve the GAU's performance.\n   - Consider the PETAH framework's approach to fine-tuning both attention and convolutional layers for task adaptation. This could provide a balanced optimization strategy for the GAU.\n\n### Implementation and Evaluation\n\n- **Feasibility Study**:\n  - Assess the practicality of integrating these techniques into the existing GAU structure. Ensure that the modifications are compatible with the current architecture and do not introduce excessive complexity.\n- **Performance Benchmarking**:\n  - Conduct thorough evaluations to compare the enhanced GAU against the original design and other sibling proposals. Metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency should be used to quantify the improvements.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a more efficient, scalable, and performant Conv GAU that leverages the strengths of spectral methods, efficient convolutional layers, and hybrid architectures.\n",

Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nY.

LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2. PuMer: Pruning and Merging Tokens for Efficient Vision Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Qingqing Cao, Bhargavi Paranjape, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*\n\n**TL;DR:** PuMer is a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale vision language (VL) models use Transformers to perform cross-modal interactions between the input text and image. These cross-modal interactions are computationally expensive and memory-intensive due to the quadratic complexity of processing the input image and text. We present PuMer: a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint. PuMer learns to keep salient image tokens related to the input text and merges similar textual and visual tokens by adding lightweight token reducer modules at several cross-modal layers in the VL model. Training PuMer is mostly the same as finetuning the original VL model but faster. Our evaluation for two vision language models on four downstream VL tasks shows PuMer increases inference throughput by up to 2x and reduces memory footprint by over 50% while incurring less than a 1% accuracy drop.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Pushdown Layers: Encoding Recursive Structure in Transformer Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursion is a prominent feature of human language, and fundamentally challenging for self-attention due to the lack of an explicit recursive-state tracking mechanism. Consequently, Transformer language models poorly capture long-tail recursive structure and exhibit sample-inefficient syntactic generalization. This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix. Transformer LMs with Pushdown Layers are syntactic language models that autoregressively and synchronously update this stack tape as they predict new tokens, in turn using the stack tape to softly modulate attention over tokens -- for instance, learning to\"skip\"over closed constituents. When trained on a corpus of strings annotated with silver constituency parses, Transformers equipped with Pushdown Layers achieve dramatically better and 3-5x more sample-efficient syntactic generalization, while maintaining similar perplexities. Pushdown Layers are a drop-in replacement for standard self-attention. We illustrate this by finetuning GPT2-medium with Pushdown Layers on an automatically parsed WikiText-103, leading to improvements on several GLUE text classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the property of convolutional neural networks, as well as a generic method to improve the performance of many CNN architectures. Specifically, we first examine existing CNN models and observe an intriguing property that the filters in the lower layers form pairs (i.e., filters with opposite phase). Inspired by our observation, we propose a novel, simple yet effective activation scheme called concatenated ReLU (CRelu) and theoretically analyze its reconstruction property in CNNs. We integrate CRelu into several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and demonstrate improvement in their recognition performance on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets with fewer trainable parameters. Our results suggest that better understanding of the properties of CNNs can lead to significant performance improvement with a simple modification.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 484  (*Influential: 44*)\n\n#### 5. Blockwise Parallel Decoding for Deep Autoregressive Models\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional autoregressive units improvements*\n\n*Mitchell Stern, Noam M. Shazeer, Jakob Uszkoreit*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel blockwise parallel decoding scheme in which it makes predictions for multiple time steps in parallel then back off to the longest prefix validated by a scoring model, which allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequences in parallel.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide variety of tasks in recent years. While common architecture classes such as recurrent, convolutional, and self-attention networks make different trade-offs between the amount of computation needed per layer and the length of the critical path at training time, generation still remains an inherently sequential process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel blockwise parallel decoding scheme in which we make predictions for multiple time steps in parallel then back off to the longest prefix validated by a scoring model. This allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequences in parallel. We verify our approach empirically through a series of experiments using state-of-the-art self-attention models for machine translation and image super-resolution, achieving iteration reductions of up to 2x over a baseline greedy decoder with no loss in quality, or up to 7x in exchange for a slight decrease in performance. In terms of wall-clock time, our fastest models exhibit real-time speedups of up to 4x over standard greedy decoding.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 162  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 6.

Hovy*\n\n**TL;DR:** MaCow is introduced, a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution, which achieves significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Abstract:** Flow-based generative models, conceptually attractive due to tractability of both the exact log-likelihood computation and latent-variable inference, and efficiency of both training and sampling, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many advanced variants and theoretical investigations. Despite their computational efficiency, the density estimation performance of flow-based generative models significantly falls behind those of state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this work, we introduce masked convolutional generative flow (MaCow), a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution. By restricting the local connectivity in a small kernel, MaCow enjoys the properties of fast and stable training, and efficient sampling, while achieving significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Yuan, Yulun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that the proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction achieve good performance but require powerful hardwares with enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Noam Shazeer, Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Wojciech Ma\u0144ke, David R. So*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention. Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolution layers language models*\n\n*Kyunghyun Cho, Jiatao Gu, Changhan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Almost all existing machine translation models are built on top of character-based vocabularies: characters, subwords or words. Rare characters from noisy text or character-rich languages such as Japanese and Chinese however can unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness. Representing text at the level of bytes and using the 256 byte set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue. High computational cost has however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. In this paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE), which is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, but is more efficient than using pure bytes only is. We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer. Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE. In the multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages and achieves better translation quality. Moreover, we show that BBPE enables transferring models between languages with non-overlapping character sets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Advancing Parsimonious Deep Learning Weather Prediction using the HEALPix Mesh\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional autoregressive units improvements*\n\n*Martin V. Butz, Noah Brenowitz, Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Dale R. Durran, Raul A. Moreno, Nathaniel Cresswell-Clay, Matthias Karlbauer*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a parsimonious deep learning weather prediction model to forecast seven atmospheric variables with 3-h time resolution for up to one-year lead times on a 110-km global mesh using the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix). In comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) weather forecast models, such as Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP-HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at one-week lead times, its skill is only about one day behind both SOTA ML forecast models and the SOTA numerical weather prediction model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We report several improvements in model design, including switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U-Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U-Net hierarchy. The consistent east-west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location-invariant convolution kernels that successfully propagate weather patterns across the globe without requiring separate kernels for the polar and equatorial faces of the cube sphere. Without any loss of spectral power after the first two days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in one-year simulations.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, Badri Narayana Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

Multi-hop Graph Convolutional Network with High-order Chebyshev Approximation for Text Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution NLP*\n\n*Lisai Zhang, Baotian Hu, Xin Liu, Qingcai Chen, Shuoran Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has become popular in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with its superiority in long-term and non-consecutive word interactions. However, existing single-hop graph reasoning in GCN may miss some important non-consecutive dependencies. In this study, we define the spectral graph convolutional network with the high-order dynamic Chebyshev approximation (HDGCN), which augments the multi-hop graph reasoning by fusing messages aggregated from direct and long-term dependencies into one convolutional layer. To alleviate the over-smoothing in high-order Chebyshev approximation, a multi-vote-based cross-attention (MVCAttn) with linear computation complexity is also proposed. The empirical results on four transductive and inductive NLP tasks and the ablation study verify the efficacy of the proposed model.

We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/67 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05946, 2015.

Introduction\n\nA key challenge in sequence modeling is summarizing, or memorizing, long-term patterns in data informative for a particular task, such as classification, forecasting, or clustering. By definition, patterns are higher-level structures in the data that arise from multiple timesteps. However, patterns can oc-\n\n[^0]cur at multiple levels, corresponding to different timescales. For example, in studying energy consumption, patterned variations may occur within a day, between days, and quarterly. Similar salient multiscale trends appear in physiological time series such as dysfunctional glucose patterns in diabetic patients and anomalous heart beats in arrhythmic patients. Audio signals of speech may be described in terms of utterances, phonemes, and subphonemes. And, the multiscale structure of images and video has been well-studied. Even for data sources without an explicit multiscale interpretation, multiscale modeling approaches can provide an efficient mechanism for capturing long-range patterns. In this paper, we propose a general and reusable building block for sequence modeling-MultiresLaYERleveraging a multiscale approach to memorize past data. We view memory through the lens of multiresolution analysis (MRA) (Willsky, 2002), with a particular emphasis on wavelet analysis, a powerful tool from signal processing for compression, denoising, feature extraction, and more (Jawerth \\& Sweldens, 1994; Akansu et al., 2001). As discussed in Sec. 2, wavelet analyses can be computed in a computationally efficient manner and interpreted as a series of convolutions. However, our use of wavelets is a design choice and other MRA techniques could likewise be considered for memorizing patterns at different timescales. Taking inspiration from wavelets, the key component of MULTiresLaYer is a multiresolution convolution operation (MultiresCONV) that retains the overall tree-structure of MRA. We show that constructing a memory of the past at each timestep of the sequence using MultiresConV can be collectively implemented as a stack of carefully-placed dilated causal convolutions with filters shared between levels. In contrast to traditional wavelet analysis, however, we learn the filters and do so end-to-end. When we fix the filters to pre-defined wavelet filters, the MUltiresConv reduces to a traditional discrete wavelet transform, though we show the benefits of learning the filters in Sec. 5.5. The basic MultiresCONV building block can be stacked in a multitude of ways that are common in deep learning models (e.g., across multiple channels, vertically as multiple layers, etc.). Our model resembles WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016a) in the use of tree-structured dilated convolutions. However, our principle-guided design has distinct skip-connection structures and filter sharing patterns, resulting in significantly\nbetter parameter efficiency and performance (see Sec. 4 for further details). There is a rapidly growing literature on machine learning for sequence modeling. Popular classes of approaches include variants of recurrent networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997), self-attention networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), and state-space models (Gu et al., 2021).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution enhancements*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

Patch-level Routing in Mixture-of-Experts is Provably Sample-efficient for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional GAUs*\n\n*Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this work shows for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, mixture-of-experts (MoE) activates one or few experts (sub-networks) on a per-sample or per-token basis, resulting in significant computation reduction. The recently proposed \\underline{p}atch-level routing in \\underline{MoE} (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. PipeGCN: Efficient Full-Graph Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Pipelined Feature Communication\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional GAUs*\n\n*Cheng Wan, Youjie Li, Cameron R. Wolfe, Anastasios Kyrillidis, Namjae Kim, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness, and develops a smoothing method to further improve Pipe GCN's convergence.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is the state-of-the-art method for learning graph-structured data, and training large-scale GCNs requires distributed training across multiple accelerators such that each accelerator is able to hold a partitioned subgraph. However, distributed GCN training incurs prohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among partitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the achievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose PipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It is non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node features/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence, negating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the convergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature gradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a smoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive experiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput (1.7x~28.5x) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and existing full-graph training methods.

Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional GAUs*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively. We open-source a privacy engine (\\url{https://github.com/woodyx218/private_vision}) that implements DP training of CNN with a few lines of code.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution NLP*\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. FLiText: A Faster and Lighter Semi-Supervised Text Classification with Convolution Networks\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution NLP*\n\n*Chen Liu, Mengchao Zhang, Zhibin Fu, Pan Hou, Yu Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSL framework called FLiText is developed, which stands for Faster and Lighter semi-supervised Text classification, which introduces an inspirer network together with the consistency regularization framework, which leverages a generalized regular constraint on the lightweight models for efficient SSL.\n\n**Abstract:** In natural language processing (NLP), state-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks have shown great performance on deep pre-trained language models such as BERT, and are expected to significantly reduce the demand for manual labeling. However, our empirical studies indicate that these frameworks are not suitable for lightweight models such as TextCNN, LSTM and etc. In this work, we develop a new SSL framework called FLiText, which stands for Faster and Lighter semi-supervised Text classification. FLiText introduces an inspirer network together with the consistency regularization framework, which leverages a generalized regular constraint on the lightweight models for efficient SSL. As a result, FLiText obtains new SOTA performance for lightweight models across multiple SSL benchmarks on text classification. Compared with existing SOTA SSL methods on TextCNN, FLiText improves the accuracy of lightweight model TextCNN from 51.00% to 90.49% on IMDb, 39.8% to 58.06% on Yelp-5, and from 55.3% to 65.08% on Yahoo! Answer. In addition, compared with the fully supervised method on the full dataset, FLiText just uses less than 1% of labeled data to improve the accuracy by 6.59%, 3.94%, and 3.22% on the datasets of IMDb, Yelp-5, and Yahoo!

Event Detection with Multi-Order Graph Convolution and Aggregated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution NLP*\n\n*Haoran Yan, Xiaolong Jin, Xiangbin Meng, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new method for event detection is proposed, which uses a dependency tree based graph convolution network with aggregative attention to explicitly model and aggregate multi-order syntactic representations in sentences.\n\n**Abstract:** Syntactic relations are broadly used in many NLP tasks. For event detection, syntactic relation representations based on dependency tree can better capture the interrelations between candidate trigger words and related entities than sentence representations. But, existing studies only use first-order syntactic relations (i.e., the arcs) in dependency trees to identify trigger words. For this reason, this paper proposes a new method for event detection, which uses a dependency tree based graph convolution network with aggregative attention to explicitly model and aggregate multi-order syntactic representations in sentences. Experimental comparison with state-of-the-art baselines shows the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 113  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DeepFilterNet: A Low Complexity Speech Enhancement Framework for Full-Band Audio based on Deep Filtering\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution enhancements*\n\n*Andreas Maier, Tobias Rosenkranz, Alberto N. Escalante-B., Hendrik Schr\u00f6ter*\n\n**Abstract:** Complex-valued processing has brought deep learning-based speech enhancement and signal extraction to a new level. Typically, the process is based on a time-frequency (TF) mask which is applied to a noisy spectrogram, while complex masks (CM) are usually preferred over real-valued masks due to their ability to modify the phase. Recent work proposed to use a complex filter instead of a point-wise multiplication with a mask. This allows to incorporate information from previous and future time steps exploiting local correlations within each frequency band. In this work, we propose DeepFilterNet, a two stage speech enhancement framework utilizing deep filtering. First, we enhance the spectral envelope using ERB-scaled gains modeling the human frequency perception. The second stage employs deep filtering to enhance the periodic components of speech. Additionally to taking advantage of perceptual properties of speech, we enforce network sparsity via separable convolutions and extensive grouping in linear and recurrent layers to design a low complexity architecture. We further show that our two stage deep filtering approach outperforms complex masks over a variety of frequency resolutions and latencies and demonstrate convincing performance compared to other state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning Spatial-Spectral Prior for Super-Resolution of Hyperspectral Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution enhancements*\n\n*Xian-Ming Liu, Junjun Jiang, Jiayi Ma, He Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, single gray/RGB image super-resolution reconstruction task has been extensively studied and made significant progress by leveraging the advanced machine learning techniques based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, there has been limited technical development focusing on single hyperspectral image super-resolution due to the high-dimensional and complex spectral patterns in hyperspectral image. In this paper, we make a step forward by investigating how to adapt state-of-the-art residual learning based single gray/RGB image super-resolution approaches for computationally efficient single hyperspectral image super-resolution, referred as SSPSR. Specifically, we introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit the spatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the hyperspectral data. Considering that the hyperspectral training samples are scarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral image data is very high, it is nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore, a group convolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling framework is proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature extraction due to high-dimension of the hyperspectral data, but also make the training process more stable. To exploit the spatial and spectral prior, we design a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual module and a spectral attention residual module. Experimental results on some hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SSPSR method enhances the details of the recovered high-resolution hyperspectral images, and outperforms state-of-the-arts.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/67 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05946, 2015.

Introduction\n\nA key challenge in sequence modeling is summarizing, or memorizing, long-term patterns in data informative for a particular task, such as classification, forecasting, or clustering. By definition, patterns are higher-level structures in the data that arise from multiple timesteps. However, patterns can oc-\n\n[^0]cur at multiple levels, corresponding to different timescales. For example, in studying energy consumption, patterned variations may occur within a day, between days, and quarterly. Similar salient multiscale trends appear in physiological time series such as dysfunctional glucose patterns in diabetic patients and anomalous heart beats in arrhythmic patients. Audio signals of speech may be described in terms of utterances, phonemes, and subphonemes. And, the multiscale structure of images and video has been well-studied. Even for data sources without an explicit multiscale interpretation, multiscale modeling approaches can provide an efficient mechanism for capturing long-range patterns. In this paper, we propose a general and reusable building block for sequence modeling-MultiresLaYERleveraging a multiscale approach to memorize past data. We view memory through the lens of multiresolution analysis (MRA) (Willsky, 2002), with a particular emphasis on wavelet analysis, a powerful tool from signal processing for compression, denoising, feature extraction, and more (Jawerth \\& Sweldens, 1994; Akansu et al., 2001). As discussed in Sec. 2, wavelet analyses can be computed in a computationally efficient manner and interpreted as a series of convolutions. However, our use of wavelets is a design choice and other MRA techniques could likewise be considered for memorizing patterns at different timescales. Taking inspiration from wavelets, the key component of MULTiresLaYer is a multiresolution convolution operation (MultiresCONV) that retains the overall tree-structure of MRA. We show that constructing a memory of the past at each timestep of the sequence using MultiresConV can be collectively implemented as a stack of carefully-placed dilated causal convolutions with filters shared between levels. In contrast to traditional wavelet analysis, however, we learn the filters and do so end-to-end. When we fix the filters to pre-defined wavelet filters, the MUltiresConv reduces to a traditional discrete wavelet transform, though we show the benefits of learning the filters in Sec. 5.5. The basic MultiresCONV building block can be stacked in a multitude of ways that are common in deep learning models (e.g., across multiple channels, vertically as multiple layers, etc.). Our model resembles WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016a) in the use of tree-structured dilated convolutions. However, our principle-guided design has distinct skip-connection structures and filter sharing patterns, resulting in significantly\nbetter parameter efficiency and performance (see Sec. 4 for further details). There is a rapidly growing literature on machine learning for sequence modeling. Popular classes of approaches include variants of recurrent networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997), self-attention networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), and state-space models (Gu et al., 2021).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Glocal: Incorporating Global Information in Local Convolution for Keyphrase Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution techniques*\n\n*Animesh Prasad, Min-Yen Kan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a method for allowing the proper incorporation of global information into the GCN family of models through the use of scaled node weights, and achieves state-of-the-art results.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a class of spectral clustering techniques that leverage localized convolution filters to perform supervised classification directly on graphical structures. While such methods model nodes\u2019 local pairwise importance, they lack the capability to model global importance relative to other nodes of the graph. This causes such models to miss critical information in tasks where global ranking is a key component for the task, such as in keyphrase extraction. We address this shortcoming by allowing the proper incorporation of global information into the GCN family of models through the use of scaled node weights. In the context of keyphrase extraction, incorporating global random walk scores obtained from TextRank boosts performance significantly.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution techniques*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 991  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 5. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution architectures*\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. MCMAE: Masked Convolution Meets Masked Autoencoders\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution architectures*\n\n*Peng Gao, Teli Ma, Hongsheng Li, Ziyi Lin, Jifeng Dai, Y. Qiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This MCMAE framework demonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more discriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme, and adopts the masked convolution to prevent information leakage in the convolution blocks.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) become widely-adopted architectures for various vision tasks. Masked auto-encoding [2, 1, 28, 55] for feature pretraining and multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer architectures [12, 21, 49, 34, 57] can further unleash the potentials of ViT, leading to state-of-the-art performances on image classification, detection and semantic segmentation. In this paper, our MCMAE framework demonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more discriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme. However, directly using the original masking strategy leads to the heavy computational cost and pretraining-finetuning discrepancy. To tackle the issue, we adopt the masked convolution to prevent information leakage in the convolution blocks. A simple block-wise masking strategy is proposed to ensure computational efficiency. We also propose to more directly supervise the multi-scale features of the encoder to boost multi-scale features. MCMAE-Base improves ImageNet-1K finetuning accuracy by 1.4% compared with MAE-Base. On object detection, MCMAE-Base finetuned for only 25 epochs surpasses MAE-Base fined-tuned for 100 epochs by 2.9% AP box and 2.2% AP mask respectively.

Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional layers GAUs*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively.

Patch-level Routing in Mixture-of-Experts is Provably Sample-efficient for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional layers GAUs*\n\n*Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this work shows for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, mixture-of-experts (MoE) activates one or few experts (sub-networks) on a per-sample or per-token basis, resulting in significant computation reduction. The recently proposed \\underline{p}atch-level routing in \\underline{MoE} (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Binarized Spectral Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution techniques*\n\n*Haoqian Wang, Yulun Zhang, Xin Yuan, Jing Lin, Yuxin Zheng, Yuanhao Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction achieve good performance but require powerful hardwares with enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

Multiresolution Convolutional Autoencoders\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution architectures*\n\n*Yu-Ying Liu, Colin Ponce, J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a multi-resolution convolutional autoencoder (MrCAE) architecture that integrates and leverages three highly successful mathematical architectures: (i) multigrid methods, (ii) convolutional autoencoders and (iii) transfer learning. The method provides an adaptive, hierarchical architecture that capitalizes on a progressive training approach for multiscale spatio-temporal data. This framework allows for inputs across multiple scales: starting from a compact (small number of weights) network architecture and low-resolution data, our network progressively deepens and widens itself in a principled manner to encode new information in the higher resolution data based on its current performance of reconstruction. Basic transfer learning techniques are applied to ensure information learned from previous training steps can be rapidly transferred to the larger network. As a result, the network can dynamically capture different scaled features at different depths of the network. The performance gains of this adaptive multiscale architecture are illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments on synthetic examples and real-world spatial-temporal data.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 4. Densely connected multidilated convolutional networks for dense prediction tasks\n\n*From Search Query: multiresolution convolution architectures*\n\n*Yuki Mitsufuji, Naoya Takahashi*\n\n**Abstract:** Tasks that involve high-resolution dense prediction require a modeling of both local and global patterns in a large input field. Although the local and global structures often depend on each other and their simultaneous modeling is important, many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches interchange representations in different resolutions only a few times. In this paper, we claim the importance of a dense simultaneous modeling of multiresolution representation and propose a novel CNN architecture called densely connected multidilated DenseNet (D3Net). D3Net involves a novel multidilated convolution that has different dilation factors in a single layer to model different resolutions simultaneously. By combining the multidilated convolution with the DenseNet architecture, D3Net incorporates multiresolution learning with an exponentially growing receptive field in almost all layers, while avoiding the aliasing problem that occurs when we naively incorporate the dilated convolution in DenseNet. Experiments on the image semantic segmentation task using Cityscapes and the audio source separation task using MUSDB18 show that the proposed method has superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the Convolutional Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) for language models, focusing on advanced spectral convolution techniques, multiresolution convolutional architectures, and efficient convolutional operations, here are the key insights and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Spectral Convolution Techniques\n\n- **Spectral Graph Convolution**: Techniques like those described in *Simple Spectral Graph Convolution* and *Specformer* can be adapted to balance global and local context capture. These methods use low-and high-pass filters and perform self-attention in the spectral domain, which can enhance the ability of Conv GAUs to model comprehensive feature representations.\n\n### Multiresolution Convolutional Architectures\n\n- **Wavelet-Inspired Designs**: The concept of multiresolution convolutions, as seen in *Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory*, can be implemented using shared filters across different dilation rates. This approach captures multiscale trends in the input sequence efficiently, similar to wavelet decompositions. This can be particularly useful for capturing hierarchical and multiscale dependencies in language data.\n\n### Efficient Convolutional Operations\n\n- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Using depthwise separable convolutions, as explained in the Wikipedia article on CNNs, can significantly reduce computational overhead and parameter count while maintaining or improving performance.

Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe proposal aims to enhance the Conv GAU (Generalized Autoregressive Unit) by integrating spectral convolution techniques and multiresolution convolutional architectures. The objective is to improve the model's ability to capture both global (long-range) and local dependencies efficiently while maintaining computational and memory efficiency.\n\nAfter reviewing the additional search results, including internal design proposals and recent external research, it appears that similar ideas have been explored extensively in prior work. There are significant overlaps with existing models such as Multiresolution Convolutional Memory (MultiresConv), Hyena Hierarchy, and the internal \"wavemamba2\" design proposal. These models incorporate spectral and multiresolution convolution techniques to enhance sequence modeling.\n\nGiven these overlaps, the novelty of the current proposal is questionable. To establish a unique contribution, the proposal would need to introduce a distinctive approach or demonstrate significant improvements over existing models.\n\n---\n\n**2.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n6 0}$ | $\\mathbf{8 6 . 4 0}$ | $\\mathbf{6 2 . 5 1}$ |\n\nPerturbation Tests To assess the faithfulness of explanations, we adopted an input perturbation scheme similar to [11, 10]. This method involves systematically masking image pixels based on their predicted relevance from the explanation method. We conducted two experiments: positive and negative perturbation. (1) Positive Perturbation: in this setup, a good explanation prioritizes relevant pixels. We expect the model's accuracy (specifically, top-1 accuracy) to gradually decrease as we mask pixels in descending order of relevance (most relevant first). (2) Negative Perturbation: Conversely, a robust explanation should maintain model accuracy even when irrelevant pixels are masked. Here, we mask pixels in ascending order of relevance (least relevant first). In both scenarios, we evaluate the explanation quality using the Area-Under-Curve (AUC) metric. AUC considers the model's accuracy as a function of the percentage of masked pixels (ranging from $10 \\%$ to $90 \\%$ ). The perturbations results are summarized in Table 2 for various explanation methods under both positive and negative perturbation scenarios on the ImageNet validation set. In the positive perturbation scenario, where lower AUC values indicate better performance, our proposed Mamba's attention method consistently outperforms the other methods. Specifically, our method achieves the lowest AUC values across all explanation methods, with an AUC of 13.264 for Raw-Attention, 12.830 for Attn-Rollout, and a notably low 11.350 for Attribution. In the negative perturbation scenario, where higher AUC values are better, our method shows the best performance, with AUC values of 47.705 for Raw-Attention, 50.035 for Attn-Rollout, and 51.310 for Attribution, outperforming both the method of [2] and the counterpart XAI methods for Vision Transformer. Perturbation experiments for the NLP domain can be found in Appendix C. In these settings, we fine-tune various LLMs with an additional linear layer classifier and append the [CLS] token to all samples to generate explanation maps, similar to methods used in vision models. These results also demonstrate that our attention formulation surpasses the previous formulation proposed by [2] over the mamba model and is effective also for the RWKV model. Ablation study The architectures we explored implicitly parametrize attention matrices through a composition of several different sub-layers, see Eq 9 , and 15 . Examples of these sub-layers include linear recurrent layers, gate mechanisms, and other components, such as token-shift or depth-wise convolutions.

Initially, in Fig 5. we visualize the implicit attention of Mamba, ablating the Conv1D or the gate branch, or focusing solely on the S6 layer. As expected, it seems that the Conv1D layer causes a smoothing effect, and the final Mamba implicit attention is significantly sharper than that of the S6 matrices. In Tab3, we compare several ablation variants of our method. As can be seen, our method, which utilizes all the components of Mamba, achieves a much better score than the ablated versions, illustrating the importance of all components. This experiment reveals that including the Conv1D layer is crucial for high performance. However, the activation has a relatively low impact on the implicit representation. A similar ablation study was conducted for RWKV and presented in Appendix C. It is evident that including the gate branch, as presented in our method, consistently improves performance.

Our unified framework facilitates the exploration of similarities and differences among non-attention layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and Griffin, and their interconnections with transformer architectures. Additionally, it enables the development of innovative explainability techniques for the latest attention-free architectures. Our contributions provide the research community with new tools for analyzing the performance, fairness, and robustness of gated-linear RNN variants, while also identifying their potential vulnerabilities. These advancements set the stage for future improvements and support the implementation of weakly supervised downstream tasks. Looking ahead, we aim to incorporate additional layers, such as Hyena [44], and HGRN2 [46] into our framework, including their vision-specific variants [16, 18, 66, 51]. Furthermore, we plan to examine how differences in these architectures are reflected in their self-attention matrices and explore whether such insights can reveal more about the inductive biases inherent in each architecture. ## 6 Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Tel Aviv University Center for AI and Data Science (TAD).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution neural networks*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Analyzing the Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks in a Spectral Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution neural networks*\n\n*M. Balcilar, G. Renton, P. H\u00e9roux, Benoit Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re, S\u00e9bastien Adam, P. Honeine*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that a spectral analysis of GNNs behavior can provide a complementary point of view to go one step further in the understanding of Gnns, and theoretically demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process regardless of whether it is designed in the spatial or the spectral domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In the recent literature of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), the expressive power of models has been studied through their capability to distinguish if two given graphs are isomorphic or not. Since the graph isomorphism problem is NP-intermediate, and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test can give sufficient but not enough evidence in polynomial time, the theoretical power of GNNs is usually evaluated by the equivalence of WL-test order, followed by an empirical analysis of the models on some reference inductive and transductive datasets. However, such analysis does not account the signal processing pipeline, whose capability is generally evaluated in the spectral domain. In this paper, we argue that a spectral analysis of GNNs behavior can provide a complementary point of view to go one step further in the understanding of GNNs. By bridging the gap between the spectral and spatial design of graph convolutions, we theoretically demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process regardless it is designed in the spatial or the spectral domain. Using this connection, we managed to re-formulate most of the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into one common framework. This general framework allows to lead a spectral analysis of the most popular GNNs, explaining their performance and showing their limits according to spectral point of view. Our theoretical spectral analysis is confirmed by experiments on various graph databases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of high and/or band-pass filters on a graph dataset, while the majority of GNN is limited to only low-pass and inevitably it fails.

How Universal Polynomial Bases Enhance Spectral Graph Neural Networks: Heterophily, Over-smoothing, and Over-squashing\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution neural networks*\n\n*Keke Huang, Yu Guang Wang, Ming Li, Pietro Li\u00f2*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel adaptive heterophily basis is developed wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), alternatively known as graph filters, have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

We redefine the task as text promptable, thereby enabling a more nuanced comprehension of surgical instruments and adaptability to new instrument types. Inspired by recent advancements in vision-language models, we leverage pretrained image and text encoders as our model backbone and design a text promptable mask decoder consisting of attention- and convolution-based prompting schemes for surgical instrument segmentation prediction. Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision. Extensive experiments on several surgical instrument segmentation datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance and promising generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a promptable approach to surgical instrument segmentation, offering significant potential for practical application in the field of robotic-assisted surgery.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 7.

Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

While such methods model nodes\u2019 local pairwise importance, they lack the capability to model global importance relative to other nodes of the graph. This causes such models to miss critical information in tasks where global ranking is a key component for the task, such as in keyphrase extraction. We address this shortcoming by allowing the proper incorporation of global information into the GCN family of models through the use of scaled node weights. In the context of keyphrase extraction, incorporating global random walk scores obtained from TextRank boosts performance significantly.

Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery with 3D Convolutional Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution neural networks*\n\n*Qiang Shen, Haokui Zhang, Ying Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research has shown that using spectral\u2013spatial information can considerably improve the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. HSI data is typically presented in the format of 3D cubes. Thus, 3D spatial filtering naturally offers a simple and effective method for simultaneously extracting the spectral\u2013spatial features within such images. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) framework is proposed for accurate HSI classification. The proposed method views the HSI cube data altogether without relying on any preprocessing or post-processing, extracting the deep spectral\u2013spatial-combined features effectively. In addition, it requires fewer parameters than other deep learning-based methods. Thus, the model is lighter, less likely to over-fit, and easier to train. For comparison and validation, we test the proposed method along with three other deep learning-based HSI classification methods\u2014namely, stacked autoencoder (SAE), deep brief network (DBN), and 2D-CNN-based methods\u2014on three real-world HSI datasets captured by different sensors.

For example, the \"wavemamba2\" proposal, which uses wavelet-based multiresolution analysis in state space models, needs to be closely examined to assess the novelty of the current proposal[4,.\n\n## Spectral Convolution Techniques\n\n- Spectral convolution techniques, such as those used in spectral graph convolution, can enhance the model's ability to capture global dependencies by operating in the frequency domain. This approach has been successful in graph neural networks and could be adapted for language models. The work by Zhu and Koniusz on \"Simple Spectral Graph Convolution\" provides insights into how spectral methods can balance low- and high-frequency components, which could be beneficial for language modeling[3,.\n\n## Multiresolution Convolutional Architectures\n\n- Multiresolution analysis, such as using dilated convolutions or wavelet transforms, allows the model to capture features at multiple scales. This is particularly useful for modeling hierarchical patterns and varying temporal dependencies in language data. The work by Shi et al. on \"Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\" and Wang et al. on \"Dilated Convolutions for Modeling Long-Distance Genomic Dependencies\" provides relevant examples of how these techniques can be applied[6,.\n\n## Efficiency and Implementation\n\n- To maintain computational and memory efficiency, the integration of spectral and multiresolution techniques must be done carefully. Efficient algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and hardware-friendly operations like depthwise separable convolutions can be crucial. The work by Cheng et al. on \"Fast Neural Networks with Circulant Projections\" highlights how circulant and Toeplitz matrices can be used to create efficient neural networks.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Models\n\n- Comparing the proposed model with existing state-of-the-art models, such as those using traditional convolutions or attention mechanisms, is essential. The researcher should look into benchmark studies that evaluate the performance of spectral and multiresolution methods against these traditional approaches. For instance, the \"Specformer\" model, which combines spectral graph convolution with Transformer architectures, could provide a useful comparison point[4,.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Global and Local Dependencies**: Spectral convolutions can capture global dependencies efficiently by focusing on frequency components, while multiresolution techniques can handle local and hierarchical dependencies by analyzing data at multiple scales.\n- **Efficiency**: Efficient implementation is key. Techniques like FFT and depthwise separable convolutions can help maintain or improve computational efficiency.\n- **Robustness and Accuracy**: Multiscale feature extraction can contribute to better generalization and robustness against noise or variations in input sequences, potentially enhancing model performance.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into Similar Designs**: Investigate the \"wavemamba2\" design proposal in detail to understand its implementation and compare it with the current proposal.\n- **Recent Advances**: Search for the latest papers (2022-2024) on spectral and multiresolution convolution techniques within language models, focusing on their integration into convolutional layers or GAUs.\n- **Implementation Studies**: Look for practical implementations or open-source projects that have integrated such techniques into language models to evaluate real-world feasibility and performance impacts.\n- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Explore studies that benchmark spectral and multiresolution methods against traditional convolutions and attention mechanisms in language modeling tasks.\n\n### Useful References\n\n1. **Shi, J., Wang, K.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 7871-7880, Online, July 2020.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

We redefine the task as text promptable, thereby enabling a more nuanced comprehension of surgical instruments and adaptability to new instrument types. Inspired by recent advancements in vision-language models, we leverage pretrained image and text encoders as our model backbone and design a text promptable mask decoder consisting of attention- and convolution-based prompting schemes for surgical instrument segmentation prediction. Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision. Extensive experiments on several surgical instrument segmentation datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance and promising generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a promptable approach to surgical instrument segmentation, offering significant potential for practical application in the field of robotic-assisted surgery.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. ViLT: Vision-and-Language Transformer Without Convolution or Region Supervision\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet convolution language models*\n\n*Wonjae Kim, Bokyung Son, Ildoo Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** A minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that the authors process textual inputs, showing that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) has improved performance on various joint vision-and-language downstream tasks. Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet convolution language models*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 4. Estimating Structured Vector Autoregressive Models\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution autoregressive models*\n\n*Igor Melnyk, A. Banerjee*\n\n**TL;DR:** In VAR setting with correlated noise, although there is strong dependence over time and covariates, this work establishes bounds on the non-asymptotic estimation error of structured VAR parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** While considerable advances have been made in estimating high-dimensional structured models from independent data using Lasso-type models, limited progress has been made for settings when the samples are dependent. We consider estimating structured VAR (vector auto-regressive models), where the structure can be captured by any suitable norm, e.g., Lasso, group Lasso, order weighted Lasso, sparse group Lasso, etc. In VAR setting with correlated noise, although there is strong dependence over time and covariates, we establish bounds on the non-asymptotic estimation error of structured VAR parameters. Surprisingly, the estimation error is of the same order as that of the corresponding Lasso-type estimator with independent samples, and the analysis holds for any norm. Our analysis relies on results in generic chaining, sub-exponential martingales, and spectral representation of VAR models. Experimental results on synthetic data with a variety of structures as well as real aviation data are presented, validating theoretical results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 5. Blockwise Parallel Decoding for Deep Autoregressive Models\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution autoregressive models*\n\n*Mitchell Stern, Noam M. Shazeer, Jakob Uszkoreit*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel blockwise parallel decoding scheme in which it makes predictions for multiple time steps in parallel then back off to the longest prefix validated by a scoring model, which allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequences in parallel.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide variety of tasks in recent years. While common architecture classes such as recurrent, convolutional, and self-attention networks make different trade-offs between the amount of computation needed per layer and the length of the critical path at training time, generation still remains an inherently sequential process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel blockwise parallel decoding scheme in which we make predictions for multiple time steps in parallel then back off to the longest prefix validated by a scoring model. This allows for substantial theoretical improvements in generation speed when applied to architectures that can process output sequences in parallel. We verify our approach empirically through a series of experiments using state-of-the-art self-attention models for machine translation and image super-resolution, achieving iteration reductions of up to 2x over a baseline greedy decoder with no loss in quality, or up to 7x in exchange for a slight decrease in performance. In terms of wall-clock time, our fastest models exhibit real-time speedups of up to 4x over standard greedy decoding.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 162  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 6. Binarized Spectral Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution autoregressive models*\n\n*Yuan-Yuan Cai, Yuxing Zheng, Jing Lin, Haoqian Wang, X. Yuan, Yulun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that the proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction achieve good performance but require powerful hardwares with enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: multiscale convolution neural networks 2023*\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Convolutional Deep Kernel Machines\n\n*From Search Query: multiscale convolution neural networks 2023*\n\n*Edward Milsom, Ben Anson, Laurence Aitchison*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces convolutional deep kernel machines, a novel inter-domain inducing point approximation, as well as introducing and experimentally assessing a number of techniques not previously seen in DKMs, including analogues to batch normalisation, different likelihoods, and different types of top-layer.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard infinite-width limits of neural networks sacrifice the ability for intermediate layers to learn representations from data. Recent work (A theory of representation learning gives a deep generalisation of kernel methods, Yang et al. 2023) modified the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) limit of Bayesian neural networks so that representation learning is retained. Furthermore, they found that applying this modified limit to a deep Gaussian process gives a practical learning algorithm which they dubbed the deep kernel machine (DKM). However, they only considered the simplest possible setting: regression in small, fully connected networks with e.g. 10 input features. Here, we introduce convolutional deep kernel machines. This required us to develop a novel inter-domain inducing point approximation, as well as introducing and experimentally assessing a number of techniques not previously seen in DKMs, including analogues to batch normalisation, different likelihoods, and different types of top-layer. The resulting model trains in roughly 77 GPU hours, achieving around 99% test accuracy on MNIST, 72% on CIFAR-100, and 92.7% on CIFAR-10, which is SOTA for kernel methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Understanding Adaptive, Multiscale Temporal Integration In Deep Speech Recognition Systems\n\n*From Search Query: multiscale convolution neural networks 2023*\n\n*Menoua Keshishian, Sam V. Norman-Haignere, N. Mesgarani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how a recently developed method for studying temporal integration in biological neural systems - the temporal context invariance (TCI) paradigm - can be used to understand temporal integration in DNNs, and suggests that deep speech recognition systems use a common motif to encode the hierarchical structure of speech.\n\n**Abstract:** Natural signals such as speech are hierarchically structured across many different timescales, spanning tens (e.g., phonemes) to hundreds (e.g., words) of milliseconds, each of which is highly variable and context-dependent. While deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at recognizing complex patterns from natural signals, relatively little is known about how DNNs flexibly integrate across multiple timescales. Here, we show how a recently developed method for studying temporal integration in biological neural systems - the temporal context invariance (TCI) paradigm - can be used to understand temporal integration in DNNs. The method is simple: we measure responses to a large number of stimulus segments presented in two different contexts and estimate the smallest segment duration needed to achieve a context invariant response. We applied our method to understand how the popular DeepSpeech2 model learns to integrate across time in speech. We find that nearly all of the model units, even in recurrent layers, have a compact integration window within which stimuli substantially alter the response and outside of which stimuli have little effect. We show that training causes these integration windows to shrink at early layers and expand at higher layers, creating a hierarchy of integration windows across the network. Moreover, by measuring integration windows for time-stretched/compressed speech, we reveal a transition point, midway through the trained network, where integration windows become yoked to the duration of stimulus structures (e.g., phonemes or words) rather than absolute time. Similar phenomena were observed in a purely recurrent and purely convolutional network although structure-yoked integration was more prominent in the recurrent network. These findings suggest that deep speech recognition systems use a common motif to encode the hierarchical structure of speech: integrating across short, time-yoked windows at early layers and long, structure-yoked windows at later layers. Our method provides a straightforward and general-purpose toolkit for understanding temporal integration in black-box machine learning models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution autoregressive models*\n\n*Arash Vahdat, Jan Kautz*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\\times$256 pixels.

Advancing Parsimonious Deep Learning Weather Prediction using the HEALPix Mesh\n\n*From Search Query: spectral convolution autoregressive models*\n\n*Martin V. Butz, Noah Brenowitz, Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Dale R. Durran, Raul A. Moreno, Nathaniel Cresswell-Clay, Matthias Karlbauer*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a parsimonious deep learning weather prediction model to forecast seven atmospheric variables with 3-h time resolution for up to one-year lead times on a 110-km global mesh using the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix). In comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) weather forecast models, such as Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP-HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at one-week lead times, its skill is only about one day behind both SOTA ML forecast models and the SOTA numerical weather prediction model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We report several improvements in model design, including switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U-Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U-Net hierarchy. The consistent east-west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location-invariant convolution kernels that successfully propagate weather patterns across the globe without requiring separate kernels for the polar and equatorial faces of the cube sphere. Without any loss of spectral power after the first two days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in one-year simulations.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates spectral convolution techniques and multiresolution convolutional architectures, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources and the researcher's analysis:\n\n## Integration of Spectral and Multiresolution Convolution Techniques\n\n### Spectral Convolution Methods\n- The work by Defferrard et al.

These methods operate in the frequency domain to capture global dependencies, which could be adapted for language models to enhance their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n### Multiresolution Convolutional Models\n- Shi et al. (2023) introduced multiresolution convolutional memory, which uses shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. This approach captures multiscale trends in the input sequence efficiently, which is crucial for modeling both local and global dependencies in language sequences.\n\n## Combining Spectral and Multiresolution Techniques\n\n- The proposal to combine spectral convolution with multiresolution convolutional architectures aligns with the idea of capturing both global and local dependencies. This combination can be seen in works like Specformer, which integrates spectral graph convolution with Transformer architectures to capture both global and local dependencies effectively.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- Efficient implementation is crucial. Techniques such as using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and depthwise separable convolutions can help mitigate computational overhead. The Hyena model by Poli et al.

However, the specific combination within the Conv GAU architecture in an autoregressive language model may still offer some novelty. It is essential to clarify how the current proposal differs from or improves upon \"wavemamba2\".\n\n## Practical Implementations and Benchmarks\n\n- To assess the practicality and performance, looking into open-source projects or code repositories that have implemented similar models is necessary. Benchmark comparisons against traditional transformers and other architectures on language modeling tasks will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n\n## Key Insights from Relevant Sources\n\n- **Multiscale Convolution Fusion**: The MLSNet model, which uses multisize convolutional fusion combined with LSTM, demonstrates how capturing features across various scales can enhance model performance. This approach can be adapted for language models to improve their ability to capture local and global dependencies.\n\n- **Attention Mechanisms**: The use of attention modules, such as the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), can help focus on important spatial or channel-wise information, which could be beneficial in enhancing feature extraction in language models.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into \"wavemamba2\"**: Obtain the full design proposal and implementation details to understand its architecture, methods, and results. This will help in identifying the differences and similarities with the current proposal.\n  \n- **Recent Research**: Search for the latest papers (2023-2024) that integrate spectral and multiresolution convolution techniques into convolutional units within autoregressive language models.\n  \n- **Practical Implementations**: Look for open-source projects or code repositories that have implemented models combining these techniques to evaluate their practical aspects.\n  \n- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Find studies or benchmarks that compare convolutional architectures using spectral and multiresolution techniques against traditional transformers and other architectures on language modeling tasks.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a comprehensive understanding of how to integrate spectral and multiresolution convolution techniques into an autoregressive language model, ensuring both high performance and efficiency.\n",

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05946, 2015.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E.

Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, existing single-hop graph reasoning in GCN may miss some important non-consecutive dependencies. In this study, we define the spectral graph convolutional network with the high-order dynamic Chebyshev approximation (HDGCN), which augments the multi-hop graph reasoning by fusing messages aggregated from direct and long-term dependencies into one convolutional layer. To alleviate the over-smoothing in high-order Chebyshev approximation, a multi-vote-based cross-attention (MVCAttn) with linear computation complexity is also proposed.

However, the strong assumption that elements are directly attentive to each other limits the performance of tasks with high-order dependencies such as natural language understanding and Image captioning. To solve such problems, we are the first to define the Jump Self-attention (JAT) to build Transformers. Inspired by the pieces moving of English Draughts, we introduce the spectral convolutional technique to calculate JAT on the dot-product feature map. This technique allows JAT\u2019s propagation in each self-attention head and is interchangeable with the canonical self-attention. We further develop the higher-order variants under the multi-hop assumption to increase the generality. Moreover, the proposed architecture is compatible with the pre-trained models. With extensive experiments, we empirically show that our methods significantly increase the performance on ten different tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, many researchers wonder whether these models can maintain their dominance forever.

Furthermore, on open-domain QA (Quasar-T and SearchQA), the combination of the CNN with ALBERT or RoBERTa achieved stronger performance than SOTA and the original TLMs. We hope that this work provides a hint for developing a novel strong network architecture along with its training scheme.

Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet-based convolutional architectures NLP*\n\n*Reinhard Heckel, Paul Hand*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an untrained simple image model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can generate natural images from very few weight parameters, with a simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the output dimensionality.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. This success can be attributed in part to their ability to represent and generate natural images well. Contrary to classical tools such as wavelets, image-generating deep neural networks have a large number of parameters---typically a multiple of their output dimension---and need to be trained on large datasets. In this paper, we propose an untrained simple image model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can generate natural images from very few weight parameters. The deep decoder has a simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the output dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to compress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par with wavelet-based thresholding. Further, underparameterization provides a barrier to overfitting, allowing the deep decoder to have state-of-the-art performance for denoising. The deep decoder is simple in the sense that each layer has an identical structure that consists of only one upsampling unit, pixel-wise linear combination of channels, ReLU activation, and channelwise normalization. This simplicity makes the network amenable to theoretical analysis, and it sheds light on the aspects of neural networks that enable them to form effective signal representations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 257  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 5.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 7.

Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Speech Separation Using an Asynchronous Fully Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: advances convolutional sequence modeling 2023*\n\n*Xiaolin Hu, Kai Li, Weiyi Zhang, Yi Luo, Jean-Marie Lemercier, Timo Gerkmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to use a bio-inspired architecture called Fully Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN) to solve the separation task, which contains bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections to fuse information processed at various time-scales represented by stages.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in the design of neural network architectures, in particular those specialized in modeling sequences, have provided significant improvements in speech separation performance. In this work, we propose to use a bio-inspired architecture called Fully Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN) to solve the separation task. This model contains bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections to fuse information processed at various time-scales represented by \\textit{stages}. In contrast to the traditional approach updating stages in parallel, we propose to first update the stages one by one in the bottom-up direction, then fuse information from adjacent stages simultaneously and finally fuse information from all stages to the bottom stage together. Experiments showed that this asynchronous updating scheme achieved significantly better results with much fewer parameters than the traditional synchronous updating scheme. In addition, the proposed model achieved good balance between speech separation accuracy and computational efficiency as compared to other state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates spectral convolution techniques and multiresolution convolutional architectures, here are the key insights and recommendations based on the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Overlap with Existing Work\nThe researcher has identified several recent works that closely align with the proposed idea, including:\n- **MultiresConv** by Shi et al.

However, these convolutional GAUs often face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and multiscale patterns inherent in natural language. Traditional convolutional approaches balance local feature extraction with computational efficiency but may struggle to integrate global contextual information effectively. Enhancing Conv GAUs with advanced spectral convolution techniques and multiresolution architectures can address these limitations, enabling models to capture both global and local dependencies more effectively while maintaining or improving computational and memory efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\nSeveral research efforts have explored methods to enhance convolutional architectures for better feature extraction and dependency modeling:\n\n1. **Spectral Graph Convolution**: *Simple Spectral Graph Convolution* and *Specformer* introduce spectral convolution techniques that balance low-and high-pass filtering to capture global and local contexts. These methods perform convolution operations in the frequency domain, enhancing the ability to model comprehensive feature representations.\n\n2. **Multiresolution Convolutional Architectures**: *Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory* and *Monarch Mixer* leverage multiresolution analysis inspired by wavelets to capture hierarchical and multiscale dependencies efficiently. Shared filters across different dilation rates facilitate the extraction of features at multiple scales without increasing model complexity.\n\n3. **Efficient Convolutional Operations**: Techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, discussed in *Understanding and Improving Convolutional Neural Networks via Concatenated Rectified Linear Units*, reduce computational overhead and parameter count while maintaining performance.\n\n4. **Hybrid and Recursive Architectures**: Integrating self-attention mechanisms with convolutional layers, as seen in *Specformer*, optimizes local and global feature extraction. Recursive state tracking mechanisms from *Eagle and Finch* enhance the ability to handle hierarchical and syntactic structures within convolutional GAUs.\n\n5. **Efficient Training and Pruning Strategies**: Approaches like pipelined feature communication from *PipeGCN* and token pruning/merging from *PuMer* streamline convolutional operations, optimizing memory usage and inference speed without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\nThese studies collectively highlight the potential benefits of integrating spectral and multiresolution techniques into convolutional architectures to enhance their expressiveness and efficiency.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe current Conv GAUs in autoregressive language models primarily focus on local feature extraction, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies and multiscale patterns essential for understanding complex linguistic structures. The key challenges include:\n\n1. **Limited Receptive Field**: Standard convolutions have a fixed receptive field that may not adequately capture global context, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Enhancing the receptive field typically involves increasing kernel sizes or stacking more layers, which can escalate computational and memory costs.\n\n3. **Multiscale Dependency Capture**: Natural language exhibits patterns at various scales, from short-term syntactic arrangements to long-term semantic dependencies. A single-scale convolution may fail to capture this hierarchical structure effectively.\n\n4. **Balancing Global and Local Context**: Efficiently integrating global contextual information with local feature extraction without compromising the model's computational efficiency remains a significant challenge.\n\nMathematical Perspective:\n\nLet \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) represent the input embeddings, where \\( B \\) is the batch size, \\( L \\) is the sequence length, and \\( D \\) is the embedding dimension. The Conv GAU applies a convolution operation \\( \\ast \\) with a kernel \\( K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times D} \\) to produce output \\( Y \\).\n\nThe goal is to enhance \\( Y \\) such that it incorporates multiscale and global contextual information:\n\n\\[\nY = X \\ast K + \\text{SpectralConvolution}(X) + \\text{MultiresolutionConvolution}(X)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\text{SpectralConvolution}(X) \\) integrates frequency-domain information to capture global dependencies.\n- \\( \\text{MultiresolutionConvolution}(X) \\) captures hierarchical and multiscale patterns through shared dilated convolutions.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- **Complexity vs. Performance**: Integrating spectral and multiresolution techniques increases model complexity, potentially impacting training stability and inference speed.\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Balancing the depth and width of convolutional layers to maintain parameter efficiency while enhancing receptive field capabilities.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection Conv\n```\n\n### Proposed Modifications\n\n1. **Integration of Spectral Convolution Techniques**:\n   - **Spectral Filters**: Introduce learnable spectral filters within the Conv GAU to perform convolution operations in the frequency domain.

Apply depthwise convolution followed by pointwise convolution:\n     \\[\n     Y_{\\text{depthwise}} = \\text{DepthwiseConv}(X) \\ast \\text{PointwiseConv}(X)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Hybrid Self-Attention**:\n   -

Utilize optimized activation functions and consider regularization techniques to prevent overfitting due to increased model capacity.\n   - Leverage efficient training techniques, such as mixed precision training, to handle the additional computational overhead introduced by spectral and multiresolution convolutions.\n\n5. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**:\n   - Compare the performance of the enhanced Conv GAU against the seed design across various benchmarks.\n   - Evaluate improvements in perplexity, accuracy, computational efficiency, and ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed SpectralMultiresConv GAU integrates spectral convolution techniques and multiresolution convolutional architectures into the existing Conv GAU framework. This enhancement enables the GAU to capture both global and local dependencies more effectively while maintaining computational and memory efficiency. By leveraging learnable spectral filters, shared dilated convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions, and self-attention mechanisms, SpectralMultiresConv addresses the limitations of traditional Conv GAUs in handling long-range dependencies and multiscale patterns. The proposed design is expected to improve model perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and scalability with increased data and model sizes, positioning it as a competitive alternative to current state-of-the-art models.\n\n## References\n\n1.
