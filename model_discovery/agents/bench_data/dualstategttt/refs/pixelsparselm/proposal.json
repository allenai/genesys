Summary of Search Results and Implications for the Proposal's Novelty and Meaningfulness**\n\nThe PixelSparseLM proposal introduces a novel autoregressive language model block that leverages structured sparsity through pixelated butterfly patterns in the attention and feed-forward layers. It also incorporates adaptive state compression and IO-aware tiling strategies to enhance computational efficiency and memory utilization.\n\nFrom the extensive search conducted, the following key points emerge:\n\n- **Novelty of Pixelated Butterfly Sparsity in Attention Mechanisms**: While pixelated butterfly sparsity patterns have been applied in neural networks to improve training efficiency (Chen et al., 2021), there is no evidence of their application specifically to the attention mechanisms within transformer-based language models. This suggests that the proposal represents a novel contribution to the field.\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: Existing methods focus on model compression through pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation (e.g., Guo et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024). The proposal's adaptive state compression introduces a dynamic mechanism integrated into the model's operation, potentially offering improved memory efficiency without degrading performance.\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling Strategies**: Prior work like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) demonstrates the effectiveness of IO-aware algorithms in optimizing attention computations. The proposal's adoption of IO-aware tiling aligns with these findings and may lead to significant improvements in hardware utilization and computational efficiency.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**: The research community is actively exploring methods to improve the efficiency of large language models through structured sparsity, adaptive compression, and hardware-aware optimizations. The PixelSparseLM proposal is well-aligned with these trends, addressing key challenges in scaling language models.\n\n**Implications**: The proposal is both novel and meaningful, potentially offering significant advancements in the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models. Its concepts are rooted in current research directions, and it addresses practical concerns related to computational resources.\n\n---\n\n**2. Assessment of Highlights and Concerns**\n\n**Highlights**:\n\n- **Novel Application of Structured Sparsity**: The integration of pixelated butterfly sparsity patterns into attention and feed-forward layers is an innovative approach that could lead to substantial computational savings.\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: The dynamic compression of model states can reduce memory usage, which is particularly beneficial for large models and long sequence processing.\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling Strategies**: By optimizing computation patterns to align with hardware capabilities, the proposal may achieve higher efficiency during both training and inference phases.\n\n- **Theoretical Soundness and Alignment with Hardware**: The design considers hardware implementation aspects, potentially enabling practical deployment on existing accelerator architectures.\n\n**Concerns**:\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating pixelated butterfly sparsity into attention mechanisms may introduce significant complexity in implementation. The feasibility of effectively implementing and training such structures within popular deep learning frameworks needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Hardware Compatibility**: While the proposal aims for hardware efficiency, there may be challenges in ensuring compatibility across different hardware platforms, especially given the specialized sparsity patterns.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance**: Introducing structured sparsity and state compression could potentially affect model accuracy and robustness. Without empirical results or simulations, it's unclear how these changes might impact performance on real-world tasks.\n\n- **Clarity and Detail in Design Explanation**: Certain aspects of the design, such as the specifics of the adaptive state compression mechanism and the detailed functioning of IO-aware tiling strategies, require more thorough explanation.\n\n---\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Design's Accuracy, Robustness, Efficiency, and Novelty**\n\n**Accuracy and Robustness**:\n\n- The proposal aims to maintain or improve model quality despite the introduction of sparsity and compression. However, without empirical validation, it's uncertain how model accuracy and robustness to varied inputs might be affected.\n\n- Structured sparsity can sometimes lead to degradation in model performance if not carefully managed. Adaptive mechanisms need to ensure that important information is preserved.\n\n**Efficiency and Scalability**:\n\n- The use of pixelated butterfly sparsity patterns has the potential to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to near-linear with respect to sequence length, significantly enhancing efficiency.\n\n- Adaptive state compression can lower memory requirements, enabling the model to handle longer sequences and larger models more effectively.\n\n- IO-aware tiling strategies are likely to improve data locality and hardware utilization, contributing to better scalability.\n\n**Novelty**:\n\n- The application of pixelated butterfly sparsity to attention mechanisms is a novel contribution, expanding the possibilities for efficient language model architectures.\n\n- Combining structured sparsity with adaptive state compression and hardware-aware optimizations represents an innovative and holistic approach.\n\n---\n\n**4. Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n- **Detailed Implementation Plan**: Provide a more detailed explanation of how the pixelated butterfly sparsity pattern will be integrated into the attention mechanisms, including mathematical formulations and potential algorithms.\n\n- **Addressing Implementation Challenges**: Discuss strategies for implementing the proposed sparsity patterns within existing deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow). Highlight any necessary modifications or extensions to accommodate the design.\n\n- **Hardware Compatibility Analysis**: Explore compatibility with different hardware platforms, considering factors like sparsity support, memory access patterns, and parallelization capabilities. Include potential solutions for hardware-specific challenges.\n\n- **Preliminary Empirical Results**: Incorporate simulations or small-scale experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design and its impact on model performance metrics such as perplexity and accuracy.\n\n- **Clarify Adaptive State Compression Mechanism**: Provide more details on how the adaptive state compression operates, how it selects which states to compress, and how it compares to existing compression techniques.\n\n- **Theoretical Analysis of Trade-offs**: Include an analysis of potential trade-offs between efficiency gains and any possible loss in model performance. This could involve complexity analysis and theoretical bounds.\n\n---\n\n**5. Final Rating**\n\nThe PixelSparseLM proposal presents a promising and innovative approach to enhancing the efficiency of autoregressive language models. It demonstrates considerable novelty by introducing pixelated butterfly sparsity to attention mechanisms and thoughtfully combines this with adaptive state compression and IO-aware tiling strategies. While there are concerns regarding implementation complexity and the need for empirical validation, the proposal is theoretically sound and aligned with current research trends.\n\n```rating 4.0```\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the PixelSparseLM proposal is a strong and well-conceived design that offers potential advancements in the field of efficient language modeling. Addressing the concerns raised, particularly by providing more detailed implementation plans and empirical evidence, will strengthen the proposal and increase its likelihood of successful adoption and impact.",

Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/50 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn I.

Modeling Hierarchical Structures with Continuous Recursive Neural Networks  (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2021)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations of traditional RvNNs by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs), which compose sequences according to their underlying hierarchical syntactic structure, have performed well in several natural language processing tasks compared to similar models without structural biases. However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent structure in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to rely on surrogate gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher bias or variance. In this work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations. This is done by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves strong performance in challenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference and ListOps. We also show that CRvNN performs comparably or better than prior latent structure models on real-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/40 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nC. and Das, S.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 44/63 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\n[68] M. Tomita.

Modeling Structure with Undirected Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Tsvetomila Mihaylova, Vlad Niculae, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins*\n\n**TL;DR:** By varying the computation order, it is shown how a single UNN can be used both as a classifier and a prototype generator, and how it can fill in missing parts of an input sequence, making them a promising field for further research.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are powerful function estimators, leading to their status as a paradigm of choice for modeling structured data. However, unlike other structured representations that emphasize the modularity of the problem -- e.g., factor graphs -- neural networks are usually monolithic mappings from inputs to outputs, with a fixed computation order. This limitation prevents them from capturing different directions of computation and interaction between the modeled variables. In this paper, we combine the representational strengths of factor graphs and of neural networks, proposing undirected neural networks (UNNs): a flexible framework for specifying computations that can be performed in any order. For particular choices, our proposed models subsume and extend many existing architectures: feed-forward, recurrent, self-attention networks, auto-encoders, and networks with implicit layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of undirected neural architectures, both unstructured and structured, on a range of tasks: tree-constrained dependency parsing, convolutional image classification, and sequence completion with attention. By varying the computation order, we show how a single UNN can be used both as a classifier and a prototype generator, and how it can fill in missing parts of an input sequence, making them a promising field for further research.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Top-down Tree Structured Decoding with Syntactic Connections for Neural Machine Translation and Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Jetic G\u016b, Hassan S. Shavarani, Anoop Sarkar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work exploits a top-down tree-structured model called DRNN (Doubly-Recurrent Neural Networks) first proposed by Alvarez-Melis and Jaakola (2017) to create an NMT model called Seq2DRNN that combines a sequential encoder with tree- Structured decoding augmented with a syntax-aware attention model.\n\n**Abstract:** The addition of syntax-aware decoding in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems requires an effective tree-structured neural network, a syntax-aware attention model and a language generation model that is sensitive to sentence structure. Recent approaches resort to sequential decoding by adding additional neural network units to capture bottom-up structural information, or serialising structured data into sequence. We exploit a top-down tree-structured model called DRNN (Doubly-Recurrent Neural Networks) first proposed by Alvarez-Melis and Jaakola (2017) to create an NMT model called Seq2DRNN that combines a sequential encoder with tree-structured decoding augmented with a syntax-aware attention model. Unlike previous approaches to syntax-based NMT which use dependency parsing models our method uses constituency parsing which we argue provides useful information for translation. In addition, we use the syntactic structure of the sentence to add new connections to the tree-structured decoder neural network (Seq2DRNN+SynC). We compare our NMT model with sequential and state of the art syntax-based NMT models and show that our model produces more fluent translations with better reordering. Since our model is capable of doing translation and constituency parsing at the same time we also compare our parsing accuracy against other neural parsing models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Discrete Opinion Tree Induction for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Chenhua Chen, Zhiyang Teng, Zhongqing Wang, Yue Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An aspect-specific and language-agnostic discrete latent opinion tree model is proposed as an alternative structure to explicit dependency trees to ease the learning of complicated structured latent variables.\n\n**Abstract:** Dependency trees have been intensively used with graph neural networks for aspect-based sentiment classification. Though being effective, such methods rely on external dependency parsers, which can be unavailable for low-resource languages or perform worse in low-resource domains. In addition, dependency trees are also not optimized for aspect-based sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose an aspect-specific and language-agnostic discrete latent opinion tree model as an alternative structure to explicit dependency trees. To ease the learning of complicated structured latent variables, we build a connection between aspect-to-context attention scores and syntactic distances, inducing trees from the attention scores. Results on six English benchmarks and one Chinese dataset show that our model can achieve competitive performance and interpretability.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. An Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree Network for Math Word Problem Solving\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Qinzhuo Wu, Qi Zhang, Zhongyu Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree model (EEH-G2T), in which the math word problems are represented as edge-labeled graphs and an edge-enhanced hierarchical graph encoder is used to incorporate edge label information.\n\n**Abstract:** Math word problem solving has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of utilizing graph neural networks to capture the relationships in the problem. However, these works did not carefully take the edge label information and the long-range word relationship across sentences into consideration. In addition, during generation, they focus on the most relevant areas of the currently generated word, while neglecting the rest of the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree model (EEH-G2T), in which the math word problems are represented as edge-labeled graphs. Specifically, an edge-enhanced hierarchical graph encoder is used to incorporate edge label information. This encoder updates the graph nodes hierarchically in two steps: sentence-level aggregation and problem-level aggregation. Furthermore, a tree-structured decoder with a split attention mechanism is applied to guide the model to pay attention to different parts of the input problem. Experimental results on the MAWPS and Math23K dataset showed that our EEH-G2T can effectively improve performance compared with state-of-the-art meth-ods. 1\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold; firstly, we propose a novel attention model on Tree Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Tree-LSTMs), a tree-structured generalization of standard LSTM. Secondly, we study the interaction between attention and syntactic structures, by experimenting with three LSTM variants: bidirectional-LSTMs, Constituency Tree-LSTMs, and Dependency Tree-LSTMs. Our models are evaluated on two semantic relatedness tasks: semantic relatedness scoring for sentence pairs (SemEval 2012, Task 6 and SemEval 2014, Task 1) and paraphrase detection for question pairs (Quora, 2017).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

DRAGNN: A Transition-based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Bogatyy, Lingpeng Kong, David Weiss, Chris Alberti, Daniel Andor*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing novel\nrecurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the\nTransition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer\nactivations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections\nto be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By\nconnecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used\narchitectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and\nre-cursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an encoder for\ndownstream tasks and as a decoder for its own task simultaneously, resulting in\nmore accurate multi-task learning.

Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Changcheng Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Shengding Hu, LiFeng Wang, Cheng Yang, Zhengyan Zhang, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou, Ganqu Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformer in Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: tree structured attention neural networks*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chunjing Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Enhua Wu, An Xiao, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost. The PyTorch code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones, and the MindSpore code is available at https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/research/cv/TNT.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using tree-structured attention mechanisms, here are some relevant findings and discussions from the provided sources and additional insights that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Combining Tree Structures with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on \"Convolutional with Attention Gated Recurrent Networks\" discusses a model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU) and an attention mechanism. Although not exclusively tree-structured, it mentions the use of tree-structured LSTM approaches and attention-based GRU models with tree structures. For example, Kokkinos & Potamianos suggested an attention-based GRU with a tree structure model where informative nodes are selected based on weighted representations of the sentence.\n\n## Improved Efficiency or Scalability\n\n- The concept of sparse attention, as discussed in the malware detection paper, can be applied to improve efficiency. Sparse attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on the most significant areas of the input, reducing computational demands while preserving high accuracy. This approach can be integrated into tree-structured models to enhance their efficiency.\n\n## Better Handling of Hierarchical Information\n\n- The study on correlating measures of hierarchical structures in artificial neural networks highlights the importance of hierarchical structures in neural networks. The Ladderpath approach examines the structural information of neural networks by identifying repeating substructures and organizing them into a hierarchical, modular-nested, tree-like structure. This approach suggests that networks with richer hierarchical structures exhibit better performance, which is relevant for designing tree-structured attention mechanisms.\n\n## Implementation Details and Practical Considerations\n\n- The analysis note on LM block design innovation emphasizes the potential of combining tree recursion with matrix-valued states and dynamic adaptation of tree structures. This can be achieved by standardizing the use of Beam Tree Recursion (BT-RvNNs) as building blocks, which can be easily stacked or interfaced with other models. This approach offers a path for further scalability and efficient compression through structural sparsity.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n- **Dynamic Tree-Structured States**: Combining tree recursion with matrix-valued states and allowing dynamic adaptation of the tree structure can enhance expressivity and efficiency. This is supported by the HybridRWKV design and the concept of Beam Tree Recursion.\n- **Adaptive Memory Management**: Implementing structure-aware compression and using hybrid state representations can help balance expressivity and efficiency. This is relevant for maintaining stability during adaptation and considering hardware constraints.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Operations**: Replacing matrix multiplications with efficient alternatives, such as element-wise operations, and optimizing memory access patterns are crucial for performance. The MatrixFreeAdaptiveTTTLinear design document provides insights into these optimizations.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n- **Beam Tree Recursion**: This approach standardizes the use of BT-RvNNs as building blocks, which can be easily stacked or interfaced with other models, offering a path for further scalability and efficient compression through structural sparsity.\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Integrating sparse attention mechanisms can improve the efficiency of tree-structured models by focusing on the most significant areas of the input, as seen in the malware detection paper.\n- **Hierarchical Structures**: The Ladderpath approach highlights the importance of hierarchical structures in neural networks, suggesting that networks with richer hierarchical structures exhibit better performance.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can design autoregressive language models that leverage tree-structured attention mechanisms, improve efficiency and scalability, and better handle hierarchical information.\n",

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Patch-level Routing in Mixture-of-Experts is Provably Sample-efficient for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing neural networks sparse computation*\n\n*Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this work shows for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, mixture-of-experts (MoE) activates one or few experts (sub-networks) on a per-sample or per-token basis, resulting in significant computation reduction. The recently proposed \\underline{p}atch-level routing in \\underline{MoE} (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Quantum Ridgelet Transform: Winning Lottery Ticket of Neural Networks with Quantum Computation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing neural networks sparse computation*\n\n*H.

Ridgelet transform has been a fundamental mathematical tool in the theoretical studies of neural networks, but the practical applicability of ridgelet transform to conducting learning tasks was limited since its numerical implementation by conventional classical computation requires an exponential runtime $\\exp(O(D))$ as data dimension $D$ increases. To address this problem, we develop a quantum ridgelet transform (QRT), which implements the ridgelet transform of a quantum state within a linear runtime $O(D)$ of quantum computation. As an application, we also show that one can use QRT as a fundamental subroutine for QML to efficiently find a sparse trainable subnetwork of large shallow wide neural networks without conducting large-scale optimization of the original network. This application discovers an efficient way in this regime to demonstrate the lottery ticket hypothesis on finding such a sparse trainable neural network. These results open an avenue of QML for accelerating learning tasks with commonly used classical neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. MIMONets: Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks Exploiting Computation in Superposition\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing neural networks sparse computation*\n\n*Nicolas Menet, Michael Hersche, G. Karunaratne, Luca Benini, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks capable of handling many inputs at once, and applies the concept of MIMONets to both CNN and Transformer architectures resulting in MIMOConv and MIMoFormer, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** With the advent of deep learning, progressively larger neural networks have been designed to solve complex tasks. We take advantage of these capacity-rich models to lower the cost of inference by exploiting computation in superposition. To reduce the computational burden per input, we propose Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks (MIMONets) capable of handling many inputs at once. MIMONets augment various deep neural network architectures with variable binding mechanisms to represent an arbitrary number of inputs in a compositional data structure via fixed-width distributed representations. Accordingly, MIMONets adapt nonlinear neural transformations to process the data structure holistically, leading to a speedup nearly proportional to the number of superposed input items in the data structure. After processing in superposition, an unbinding mechanism recovers each transformed input of interest. MIMONets also provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and throughput by an instantaneous on-demand switching between a set of accuracy-throughput operating points, yet within a single set of fixed parameters. We apply the concept of MIMONets to both CNN and Transformer architectures resulting in MIMOConv and MIMOFormer, respectively. Empirical evaluations show that MIMOConv achieves about 2-4 x speedup at an accuracy delta within [+0.68, -3.18]% compared to WideResNet CNNs on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Similarly, MIMOFormer can handle 2-4 inputs at once while maintaining a high average accuracy within a [-1.07, -3.43]% delta on the long range arena benchmark. Finally, we provide mathematical bounds on the interference between superposition channels in MIMOFormer.

State Transition of Dendritic Spines Improves Learning of Sparse Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing neural networks sparse computation*\n\n*Yanqing Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Wei Fang, Zhengyu Ma, Tiejun Huang, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work organizes SNN pruning techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights, which yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered a promising alternative to Arti\ufb01cial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their event-driven computing paradigm when deployed on energy-ef\ufb01cient neuromorphic hardware. Recently, deep SNNs have shown breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and \ufb02exi-ble structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines in the \ufb01lopodial model of spinogen-esis, we model different states of SNN weights, facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet) while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss ( \u223c 3% at 88.8% sparsity) compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs. Moreover, we \ufb01nd out pruning speed regulation while learning is crucial to avoiding disastrous performance degradation at the \ufb01nal stages of training, which may shed light on future work on SNN pruning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing neural networks sparse computation*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Sheng-Wei Chen, Kaixiong Zhou, D. Zha, Xiao Huang, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Randomized Sparse Computation is proposed, which for the first time demonstrate the potential of training GNNs with approximated operations and proposes a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNN\u2019s trained with approximating operations.\n\n**Abstract:** The training of graph neural networks (GNNs) is extremely time consuming because sparse graph-based operations are hard to be accelerated by hardware. Prior art explores trading off the computational precision to reduce the time complexity via sampling-based approximation. Based on the idea, previous works successfully accelerate the dense matrix based operations (e.g., convolution and linear) with negligible accuracy drop. However, unlike dense matrices, sparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that each row/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to the dense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges (1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation since the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sub-sampling sparse matrices is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format. To address the issues, our key idea is to control the accuracy-efficiency trade off by optimizing computation resource allocation layer-wisely and epoch-wisely. Specifically, for the first challenge, we customize the computation resource to different sparse operations, while limit the total used resource below a certain budget. For the second challenge, we cache previous sampled sparse matrices to reduce the epoch-wise sampling overhead. Finally, we propose a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNNs trained with approximated operations. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse Computation, which for the first time demonstrate the potential of training GNNs with approximated operations. In practice, rsc can achieve up to $11.6\\times$ speedup for a single sparse operation and a $1.6\\times$ end-to-end wall-clock time speedup with negligible accuracy drop.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on dynamic routing, efficient sparse computation, hardware optimization for tree-structured operations, and adaptive network architectures, here are some relevant findings and references:\n\n## Dynamic Routing Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- **Capsule Networks**: The dynamic routing algorithm in Capsule Networks is a key innovation that allows the network to decide where to send the output of each capsule based on the current input. This iterative routing-by-agreement method helps in preserving more information from lower-level capsules and is particularly useful for complex tasks.\n  - The dynamic routing algorithm in CapsNet involves an iterative process where the outputs of lower-layer capsules are routed to the appropriate higher-layer capsules, which helps in maintaining detailed information throughout the network.\n\n## Efficient Sparse Computation Techniques\n\n- **DropConnect and Sparse Attention**: Techniques like DropConnect, which is a generalization of dropout, introduce dynamic sparsity within the model by dropping connections rather than output units. This can be applied to reduce computational overhead and improve efficiency.\n  - Sparse attention mechanisms can also be used to focus computation on the most relevant parts of the input, reducing the overall computational cost. This is particularly relevant for large-scale language models where sparse attention can help in scaling the model efficiently[Analysis Note: Section 3.2].\n\n## Hardware Optimization for Tree-Structured Operations\n\n- **Hierarchical and Tree-Structured Architectures**: Models like the Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree Network and the Transformer in Transformer architecture demonstrate how hierarchical and tree-structured operations can be optimized. These models use hierarchical feature aggregation and tree-structured decoders, which can be optimized for hardware efficiency by leveraging local and global attention separation and structure-aware sparsity[Analysis Note: Sections 2 and 3].\n  - Efficient memory access patterns and matrix-free computations can be crucial for optimizing these tree-structured operations on hardware[Analysis Note: Section 3].\n\n## Adaptive Network Architectures\n\n- **DRAGNN and Dynamic State Management**: The DRAGNN model, which uses Transition Based Recurrent Units (TBRUs) with discrete state dynamics, shows how network connections can be built dynamically based on intermediate activations. This dynamic state management can lead to more accurate and efficient models compared to traditional seq2seq models with attention[Analysis Note: Section 2].\n  - Adaptive compression mechanisms and dynamic structure adaptation are also key aspects of these models, allowing them to balance between compression and expressivity while maintaining efficiency[Analysis Note: Section 3].\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hierarchical Information Processing**: Models that incorporate hierarchical structures with attention mechanisms, such as Structural Attention Neural Networks and the Edge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph-to-Tree Network, demonstrate improved performance by leveraging multi-level feature extraction and structure-aware compression[Analysis Note: Sections 2 and 3].\n- **Dynamic Routing and Hierarchical Feature Aggregation**: The use of dynamic routing in Capsule Networks and other hierarchical models highlights the importance of adaptive information routing in neural networks.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

AutoSNN: Towards Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention architectures hardware aware neural networks*\n\n*Byunggook Na, J. Mok, Seongsik Park, Dongjin Lee, Hyeokjun Choe, Sungroh Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spike-aware neural architecture search framework called AutoSNN, which successfully searches for SNN architectures that outperform hand-crafted SNNs in accuracy and energy efficiency and introduces a fitness that considers both the accuracy and number of spikes.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) that mimic information transmission in the brain can energy-efficiently process spatio-temporal information through discrete and sparse spikes, thereby receiving considerable attention. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency of SNNs, most previous studies have focused solely on training methods, and the effect of architecture has rarely been studied. We investigate the design choices used in the previous studies in terms of the accuracy and number of spikes and figure out that they are not best-suited for SNNs. To further improve the accuracy and reduce the spikes generated by SNNs, we propose a spike-aware neural architecture search framework called AutoSNN. We define a search space consisting of architectures without undesirable design choices. To enable the spike-aware architecture search, we introduce a fitness that considers both the accuracy and number of spikes. AutoSNN successfully searches for SNN architectures that outperform hand-crafted SNNs in accuracy and energy efficiency. We thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSNN on various datasets including neuromorphic datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. HW-NAS-Bench: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention architectures hardware aware neural networks*\n\n*Chaojian Li, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Qixuan Yu, Yue Wang, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HW-NAS-Bench is developed, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW- NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NA research more reproducible and accessible and verify that dedicated device-specific HW- Nas can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.\n\n**Abstract:** HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention architectures hardware aware neural networks*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. Training Feedback Spiking Neural Networks by Implicit Differentiation on the Equilibrium State\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention architectures hardware aware neural networks*\n\n*Mingqing Xiao, Qingyan Meng, Zongpeng Zhang, Yisen Wang, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers feedback spiking neural networks, which are more brain-like, and proposes a novel training method that does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation, and demonstrates the superior performance of the method for feedback models with fewer neurons and parameters in a small number of time steps.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are brain-inspired models that enable energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, the supervised training of SNNs remains a hard problem due to the discontinuity of the spiking neuron model. Most existing methods imitate the backpropagation framework and feedforward architectures for artificial neural networks, and use surrogate derivatives or compute gradients with respect to the spiking time to deal with the problem. These approaches either accumulate approximation errors or only propagate information limitedly through existing spikes, and usually require information propagation along time steps with large memory costs and biological implausibility. In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural networks, which are more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. First, we show that the average firing rates of SNNs with feedback connections would gradually evolve to an equilibrium state along time, which follows a fixed-point equation. Then by viewing the forward computation of feedback SNNs as a black-box solver for this equation, and leveraging the implicit differentiation on the equation, we can compute the gradient for parameters without considering the exact forward procedure. In this way, the forward and backward procedures are decoupled and therefore the problem of non-differentiable spiking functions is avoided. We also briefly discuss the biological plausibility of implicit differentiation, which only requires computing another equilibrium. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superior performance of our method for feedback models with fewer neurons and parameters in a small number of time steps.

Bi-Directional Block Self-Attention for Fast and Memory-Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention architectures hardware aware neural networks*\n\n*Tao Shen, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN), for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding that achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN /CNN/SAN.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention networks (SAN) are commonly used to produce context-aware representations. RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)\", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory-efficient attention mechanisms, hardware-aware neural network design, efficient implementations of attention variants, and memory optimization techniques, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms and Architectures\n\n### Block-Attention\nThe \"Block-Attention\" mechanism introduced in is designed to reduce inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/16 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nURL http: / / arxiv.org/abs/2310. 05736. arXiv:2310.05736 [cs].

Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.74)\n\n*Rares Dolga, Marius Cobzarenco, David Barber*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A method to reduce the time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors is introduced, which allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer scales quadratically with the length of the sequence. We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression structured sparsity hardware efficient activation*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression structured sparsity hardware efficient activation*\n\n*Yulun Zhang, Huan Wang, Can Qin, Y. Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity, is proposed and applied to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) networks have obtained promising re-sults with moderate model size. Many SR methods have focused on designing lightweight architectures, which neglect to further reduce the redundancy of network parameters. On the other hand, model compression techniques, like neural architecture search and knowledge distillation, typically consume considerable memory and computation resources. In contrast, network pruning is a cheap and effective model compression technique. However, it is hard to be applied to SR networks directly, because \ufb01lter pruning for residual blocks is well-known tricky. To address the above issues, we propose aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity. To align the pruned \ufb01lter locations across different layers, we propose a sparsity structure alignment penalty term, which minimizes the norm of soft mask gram matrix. We apply aligned structured sparsity learning strategy to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network, named as ASSLN, with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods. We conduct extensive comparisons with lightweight SR networks. Our ASSLN achieves superior performance gains over recent methods quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression structured sparsity hardware efficient activation*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Kaizhao Liang, Jiaming Yang, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 4. Learning N: M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression structured sparsity hardware efficient activation*\n\n*Aojun Zhou, Yukun Ma, Junnan Zhu, Jianbo Liu, Zhijie Zhang, Kun Yuan, Wenxiu Sun, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper is the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine- grained sparsity and structured coarse-grains sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to compress and accelerate the models on resource-constrained environments. It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and decent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2\u00d7 speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network\u2019s topology change during the training process. Finally, We justify SR-STE\u2019s advantages with SAD and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-STE by performing comprehensive experiments on various tasks.

Towards Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks Construction with Spiking Activity based Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression structured sparsity hardware efficient activation*\n\n*Yaxin Li, Qi Xu, Jiangrong Shen, Hongming Xu, Long Chen, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework, Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, which indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibiting high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need for compressing network models due to the presence of a significant number of redundant structural units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power consumption and biological interpretability advantages. Currently, most model compression techniques for SNNs are based on unstructured pruning of individual connections, which requires specific hardware support. Hence, we propose a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework. Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically adjusts the network's structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels during training, enhancing the model's adaptation to the current target task. While maintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture, ultimately reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process. This indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on memory efficiency, hardware awareness, and advanced compression techniques, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Advanced Neural Network Compression Techniques\n\n- **Quantization Methods**: Techniques like Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) are crucial for reducing the precision of model weights, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Methods such as GPTQ and bitsandbytes are highlighted for their effectiveness in mixed-precision quantization and optimizing memory usage.\n\n- **Neural Compression**: Using neural networks for lossless compression, particularly in text domains, has shown promising results. Neural compressors paired with arithmetic coding can achieve better compression rates than traditional compressors, which can be beneficial for reducing the memory footprint of LMs.\n\n## Structured Sparsity Methods for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Structured Sparsity**: This approach enables better hardware utilization by introducing sparsity in a structured manner. For attention mechanisms, structured sparsity can be applied to reduce the computational overhead and memory requirements. While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss structured sparsity in attention mechanisms, the concept is closely related to the optimization of matrix operations and state management in attention models. The analysis note suggests that structured approaches to state management are essential, which can be extended to include structured sparsity.\n\n- **Block-Based Attention**: Methods like Ring Attention and Lightning Attention-2 use blockwise computation of self-attention, which can be seen as a form of structured sparsity. These approaches reduce the memory footprint and optimize hardware utilization by processing attention in blocks rather than globally.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Activation Functions\n\n- **Efficient Activation Functions**: While the provided sources do not specifically discuss hardware-efficient activation functions, the general principle of using simpler activation functions can be inferred. For instance, using linear or gated linear attention functions can be more hardware-efficient compared to complex non-linear functions. The \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" paper suggests that linear attention functions can be optimized for hardware efficiency, which aligns with the need for simpler activation functions.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Training Techniques\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: Techniques like FlashFFTConv and Ring Attention use block-based processing to reduce memory requirements. This approach allows for longer sequence lengths without significantly increasing memory usage. These methods optimize computation by utilizing tensor cores and overlapping communication with computation.\n\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Algorithms that are IO-aware, such as Lightning Attention-2, are crucial for optimizing memory access patterns and reducing computational overhead. These methods ensure that the data transfer between memory and processing units is minimized, leading to more efficient training and inference.\n\n- **Matrix-Free Operations**: Using matrix-free operations, as suggested in the analysis note, can reduce the computational overhead and memory requirements. This is particularly relevant for large language models where matrix operations can be computationally intensive.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware autoregressive language models that leverage advanced compression techniques, structured sparsity, and optimized activation functions.\n",

While Chen et al. (2021) introduced pixelated butterfly sparsity in neural networks, there is no evidence of its application to attention layers in transformers. This novelty could represent a significant advancement in the design of efficient language models.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Adaptive State Compression**\n\n  Adaptive state compression methods like GRAIN (Yang et al., 2022) and SPP (Lu et al., 2024) focus on pruning and compressing models while maintaining performance. The proposal's adaptive state compression offers a dynamic approach integrated directly into the model's operation, potentially enhancing memory efficiency without significant performance degradation.\n\n- **Implementation of IO-Aware Tiling Strategies**\n\n  IO-aware algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) have demonstrated substantial improvements in computational efficiency by optimizing memory access patterns. The proposal's adoption of IO-aware tiling strategies likely enhances hardware utilization, leveraging capabilities such as tensor cores in modern GPUs.\n\n- **Impact on Performance Metrics**\n\n  Research indicates that efficiency improvements through sparsity and compression can be achieved without compromising accuracy. The proposal's focus on maintaining model quality while enhancing efficiency aligns with successful approaches in recent studies (Ren et al., 2023; Pagliardini et al., 2023).\n\n- **Alignment with Research Trends**\n\n  The proposal is consistent with the current emphasis on developing efficient and scalable language models.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

Extensive ablations demonstrate the effectiveness of our modifications and innovations in position encoding, gating mechanism, activation functions, normalization functions, and lightning attentions. These modifications collectively contribute to TransNormerLLM's outstanding performance, positioning it as a promising choice for state-of-the-art language models. The benchmark results for models with sizes of 385 million, 1 billion, and 7 billion parameters unequivocally demonstrate that TransNormerLLM not only matches the performance of current leading Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) but also enjoys faster inference speeds. We will release our pre-trained TransNormerLLM models to foster community advancements in efficient LLM. ## REFERENCES\n\nEbtesam Almazrouei, Hamza Alobeidli, Abdulaziz Alshamsi, Alessandro Cappelli, Ruxandra Cojocaru, Merouane Debbah, Etienne Goffinet, Daniel Heslow, Julien Launay, Quentin Malartic, et al.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/52 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473, 2014.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

It inherits the fine-to-coarse-grained learnable hierarchy of traditional butterflies and when deployed to neural networks, the prominent structures and sparsity in a DeBut layer constitutes a new way for network compression. We apply DeBut as a drop-in replacement of standard fully connected and convolutional layers, and demonstrate its superiority in homogenizing a neural network and rendering it favorable properties such as light weight and low inference complexity, without compromising accuracy. The natural complexity-accuracy tradeoff arising from the myriad deformations of a DeBut layer also opens up new rooms for analytical and practical research.

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations\n\n*From Search Query: \"pixelated butterfly sparsity\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 92  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3.

Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. SmoothQuant: Accurate and Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient language models\"*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Ji Lin, Mickael Seznec, Julien Demouth, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs, offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance but are compute- and memory-intensive. Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, Llama-1/2, Falcon, Mistral, and Mixtral models. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 486  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 5.

Barrett, Joseph Gonzalez, Percy Liang, Christopher R\u00e9, Ion Stoica, Ce Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** FlexGen is presented, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory that compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss, enabling FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput.\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

Adaptive Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for BERT Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Jinyang Guo, Jiaheng Liu, Z. Wang, Yuqing Ma, Ruihao Gong, Ke Xu, Xianglong Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel contrastive distillation loss based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features and incorporates this strategy into a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation approach called adaptive contrastive knowledge distillation (ACKD) for BERT compression. Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M. Larson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression, and reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of P AP perturbation.\n\n**Abstract:** Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 8. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Turbo Sparse: Achieving LLM SOTA Performance with Minimal Activated\n  Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: \"pixelated butterfly sparsity\"*\n\n*Yixin Song, Haotong Xie, Zhengyan Zhang, Bo Wen, Li Ma, Zeyu Mi, Haibo Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Exploiting activation sparsity is a promising approach to significantly\naccelerating the inference process of large language models (LLMs) without\ncompromising performance. However, activation sparsity is determined by\nactivation functions, and commonly used ones like SwiGLU and GeGLU exhibit\nlimited sparsity. Simply replacing these functions with ReLU fails to achieve\nsufficient sparsity. Moreover, inadequate training data can further increase\nthe risk of performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel dReLU function, which is designed to improve LLM activation sparsity,\nalong with a high-quality training data mixture ratio to facilitate effective\nsparsification. Additionally, we leverage sparse activation patterns within the\nFeed-Forward Network (FFN) experts of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to\nfurther boost efficiency. By applying our neuron sparsification method to the\nMistral and Mixtral models, only 2.5 billion and 4.3 billion parameters are\nactivated per inference iteration, respectively, while achieving even more\npowerful model performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that this sparsity\nachieves a 2-5x decoding speedup. Remarkably, on mobile phones, our\nTurboSparse-Mixtral-47B achieves an inference speed of 11 tokens per second.\nOur models are available at \\url{https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer}\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-10T01:21:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T02:15:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Should we Stop Training More Monolingual Models, and Simply Use Machine\n  Translation Instead?\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient language models\"*\n\n*Tim Isbister, Fredrik Carlsson, Magnus Sahlgren*\n\n**Abstract:** Most work in NLP makes the assumption that it is desirable to develop\nsolutions in the native language in question. There is consequently a strong\ntrend towards building native language models even for low-resource languages.\nThis paper questions this development, and explores the idea of simply\ntranslating the data into English, thereby enabling the use of pretrained, and\nlarge-scale, English language models. We demonstrate empirically that a large\nEnglish language model coupled with modern machine translation outperforms\nnative language models in most Scandinavian languages. The exception to this is\nFinnish, which we assume is due to inferior translation quality. Our results\nsuggest that machine translation is a mature technology, which raises a serious\ncounter-argument for training native language models for low-resource\nlanguages. This paper therefore strives to make a provocative but important\npoint. As English language models are improving at an unprecedented pace, which\nin turn improves machine translation, it is from an empirical and environmental\nstand-point more effective to translate data from low-resource languages into\nEnglish, than to build language models for such languages.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-21T10:21:24Z  (*Updated: 2021-04-21T10:21:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Indic-Transformers: An Analysis of Transformer Language Models for\n  Indian Languages\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient language models\"*\n\n*Kushal Jain, Adwait Deshpande, Kumar Shridhar, Felix Laumann, Ayushman Dash*\n\n**Abstract:** Language models based on the Transformer architecture have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks such as text\nclassification, question-answering, and token classification. However, this\nperformance is usually tested and reported on high-resource languages, like\nEnglish, French, Spanish, and German. Indian languages, on the other hand, are\nunderrepresented in such benchmarks. Despite some Indian languages being\nincluded in training multilingual Transformer models, they have not been the\nprimary focus of such work. In order to evaluate the performance on Indian\nlanguages specifically, we analyze these language models through extensive\nexperiments on multiple downstream tasks in Hindi, Bengali, and Telugu\nlanguage. Here, we compare the efficacy of fine-tuning model parameters of\npre-trained models against that of training a language model from scratch.\nMoreover, we empirically argue against the strict dependency between the\ndataset size and model performance, but rather encourage task-specific model\nand method selection. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on Hindi and\nBengali languages for text classification task. Finally, we present effective\nstrategies for handling the modeling of Indian languages and we release our\nmodel checkpoints for the community :\nhttps://huggingface.co/neuralspace-reverie.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-04T14:43:43Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-04T14:43:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large\n  Language Model Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high\nmemory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference.\nWhile key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously\ncomputed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead.\nExisting KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically\ncompress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden\nstates, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our\napproach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. LadaBERT: Lightweight Adaptation of BERT through Hybrid Model\n  Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Yihuan Mao, Yujing Wang, Chufan Wu, Chen Zhang, Yang Wang, Yaming Yang, Quanlu Zhang, Yunhai Tong, Jing Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** BERT is a cutting-edge language representation model pre-trained by a large\ncorpus, which achieves superior performances on various natural language\nunderstanding tasks. However, a major blocking issue of applying BERT to online\nservices is that it is memory-intensive and leads to unsatisfactory latency of\nuser requests, raising the necessity of model compression. Existing solutions\nleverage the knowledge distillation framework to learn a smaller model that\nimitates the behaviors of BERT. However, the training procedure of knowledge\ndistillation is expensive itself as it requires sufficient training data to\nimitate the teacher model. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a\nhybrid solution named LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid\nmodel compression), which combines the advantages of different model\ncompression methods, including weight pruning, matrix factorization and\nknowledge distillation. LadaBERT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various\npublic datasets while the training overheads can be reduced by an order of\nmagnitude.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-08T17:18:56Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T15:15:11Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"pixelated butterfly sparsity\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient language models\"*\n\n*Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Hari Subramoni, Aamir Shafi, Olatunji Ruwase, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs, Jinghan Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient language models\"*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Maximizing Communication Efficiency for Large-scale Training via 0/1 Adam\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Christopher De Sa, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yucheng Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** 1-bit gradient compression and local steps are two representative techniques that enable drastic communication reduction in distributed SGD. Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT). In this paper, we demonstrate the non-linearity in Adam causes slow convergence even when 1-bit compression or local steps are individually applied. To alleviate this limitation, we propose 0/1 Adam that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. 0/1 Adam performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for 0/1 Adam on smooth non-convex objectives. On various large-scale benchmarks such as BERT-Base, BERT-Large, GPT-2 pre-training and ImageNet, we demonstrate on up to 128 GPUs that 0/1 Adam is able to reduce up to 87% of data volume, 54% of communication rounds, and achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher training throughput and end-to-end training time reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline 1-bit Adam; while enjoying the same statistical convergence speed and end task model accuracy on GLUE dataset and ImageNet validation set.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression\"*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Introduction\n\nEstimating complex, high-dimensional data distributions is a central problem in unsupervised learning, as many downstream applications of interest involve generation of text, images, audio, and other data. Additionally, it is believed to be a key component of unsupervised representation learning. Recently, neural autoregressive models have achieved impressive results in this domain, achieving state-of-the-art in modeling natural language (Jozefowicz et al., 2016) (Radford et al., 2018) (Dai et al., 2018), raw audio (Van Den Oord et al., 2016) (Mehri et al., 2016), and images (Oord et al., 2016) (Menick \\& Kalchbrenner, 2018) (Salimans et al., 2017) (Reed et al., 2017) (Chen et al., 2017). These methods decompose a joint probability distribution into a product of conditional ones. Modeling these conditional distributions is extremely challenging, however, as they contain many complex, long-range dependencies and require a suitably expressive model architecture to learn them. Architectures based off CNNs (Oord et al., 2016) have made\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_befcc9f073998d256dabg-01.jpg?height=1020&width=796&top_left_y=604&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1. Unconditional samples from our neural autoregressive model on ImageNet 64 and a classical music dataset. We used the same self-attention based architecture for audio, images, and text. The samples above were generated with softmax temperature 1.0, and had lengths 12,288 and 65,536. Audio samples be listened to at https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer\ngreat progress in this direction, but require significant depth to expand their receptive field. To address this, WaveNet (Van Den Oord et al., 2016) introduced dilated convolutions, which allowed the network to model long-range dependencies in a logarithmic number of layers. Separately, the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has been shown to excel on many natural language tasks, which may be in part due to its ability to model arbitrary dependencies in a constant number of layers. As each self-attention layer has a global receptive field, the network can allocate representational capacity to the input regions for which it is\nmost useful. Thus the architecture may be more flexible at generating diverse data types than networks with fixed connectivity patterns. However, the memory and computational requirements of such networks grows quadratically with sequence length, which excludes their use on long sequences. The main contribution of this work is to introduce several sparse factorizations of the attention matrix, which scale as $O(n \\sqrt[p]{n})$ with the sequence length without sacrificing performance. These work by separating the full attention computation into several faster attention operations which, when combined, can approximate the dense attention operation. We use this to apply self-attention to sequences of unprecedented length. Additionally, we introduce several other changes to the Transformer, including:\n\n- A restructured residual block and weight initialization to improve training of very deep networks\n- A set of sparse attention kernels which efficiently compute subsets of the attention matrix\n- Recomputation of attention weights during the backwards pass to reduce memory usage\n\nWe empirically validate that models augmented in this manner can achieve state-of-the-art compression and generation of natural language, raw audio, and natural images.\n```\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Do Transformer Models Show Similar Attention Patterns to Task-Specific Human Gaze?\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Oliver Eberle, Stephanie Brandl, Jonas Pilot, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**TL;DR:** The predictiveness of large-scale pre-trained self-attention for human attention depends on \u2018what is in the tail\u2019, e.g., the syntactic nature of rare contexts, and it is found that lower-entropy attention vectors are more faithful.\n\n**Abstract:** Learned self-attention functions in state-of-the-art NLP models often correlate with human attention. We investigate whether self-attention in large-scale pre-trained language models is as predictive of human eye fixation patterns during task-reading as classical cognitive models of human attention. We compare attention functions across two task-specific reading datasets for sentiment analysis and relation extraction. We find the predictiveness of large-scale pre-trained self-attention for human attention depends on \u2018what is in the tail\u2019, e.g., the syntactic nature of rare contexts.Further, we observe that task-specific fine-tuning does not increase the correlation with human task-specific reading. Through an input reduction experiment we give complementary insights on the sparsity and fidelity trade-off, showing that lower-entropy attention vectors are more faithful.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

SparseGPT: Massive Language Models Can Be Accurately Pruned in One-Shot\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*Elias Frantar, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**Abstract:** We show for the first time that large-scale generative pretrained transformer (GPT) family models can be pruned to at least 50% sparsity in one-shot, without any retraining, at minimal loss of accuracy. This is achieved via a new pruning method called SparseGPT, specifically designed to work efficiently and accurately on massive GPT-family models. We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time. SparseGPT generalizes to semi-structured (2:4 and 4:8) patterns, and is compatible with weight quantization approaches.

Boost Transformer-based Language Models with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*Chong Yu, Tao Chen, Zhongxue Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Along with the performance improvement in NLP domain, the sizes of transformer-based language models ( TLM ) are also dramatically increased. Some prior works intend to compress TLM models into more compact forms, but do not fully consider the hardware characters may not support the efficient execution for these forms, leading to the deployment of TLM on hardware with noticeable acceleration is still challenging. This paper thoroughly designs a compression scheme named GPUSQ-TLM to maximally utilize the GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization characters . Especially, a dense TLM model is first pruned to meet the GPU\u2019s acceleration constraint of sparse patterns with FP16 type, then it is further quantized into a fixed-point one by quantization-aware training, to provide an extra speedup for integer tensors on GPU. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation of labels, logits and feature maps is used for best accuracy compensation during pruning and quantization process. Experiment results show GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-TLM can boost actual deployment performance by up to 4.08-4.25 \u00d7 times latency and 6.18-6.79 \u00d7 throughput on A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Despite the versatility of encoder-decoder models in numerous NLP tasks, the structured pruning methods on such models are relatively less explored compared to encoder-only models. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the structured pruning of the encoder-decoder models in the decoupled pruning perspective of the encoder and decoder component, respectively. Our findings highlight two insights: (1) the number of decoder layers is the dominant factor of inference speed, and (2) low sparsity in the pruned encoder network enhances generation quality. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple and effective framework, NASH, that narrows the encoder and shortens the decoder networks of encoder-decoder models. Extensive experiments on diverse generation and inference tasks validate the effectiveness of our method in both speedup and output quality.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies.

Extreme Compression for Pre-trained Transformers Made Simple and Efficient\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression transformers\"*\n\n*Xiaoxia Wu, Z. Yao, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective compression pipeline for extreme compression, named XTC, which demonstrates that it can skip the pre-training knowledge distillation to obtain a 5-layer BERT while achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT.\n\n**Abstract:** Extreme compression, particularly ultra-low bit precision (binary/ternary) quantization, has been proposed to fit large NLP models on resource-constraint devices. However, to preserve the accuracy for such aggressive compression schemes, cutting-edge methods usually introduce complicated compression pipelines, e.g., multi-stage expensive knowledge distillation with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Also, they oftentimes focus less on smaller transformer models that have already been heavily compressed via knowledge distillation and lack a systematic study to show the effectiveness of their methods. In this paper, we perform a very comprehensive systematic study to measure the impact of many key hyperparameters and training strategies from previous works. As a result, we find out that previous baselines for ultra-low bit precision quantization are significantly under-trained. Based on our study, we propose a simple yet effective compression pipeline for extreme compression, named XTC. XTC demonstrates that (1) we can skip the pre-training knowledge distillation to obtain a 5-layer BERT while achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT; (2) extreme quantization plus layer reduction is able to reduce the model size by 50x, resulting in new state-of-the-art results on GLUE tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Diffuser: Efficient Transformers with Multi-hop Attention Diffusion for\n  Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Aosong Feng, Irene Li, Yuang Jiang, Rex Ying*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient Transformers have been developed for long sequence modeling, due to\ntheir subquadratic memory and time complexity. Sparse Transformer is a popular\napproach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting\nself-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns.\nHowever, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to\nfull-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To\ncombine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the\nexpressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \\textit{Diffuser}, a\nnew state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token\ninteractions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and\nmemory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention\nusing Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on\nall paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among\nneighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a\nuniversal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and\ninvestigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph\nexpander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate\nthe effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language\nmodeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA). Evaluation results show\nthat Diffuser achieves improvements by an average of 0.94% on text\nclassification tasks and 2.30% on LRA, with 1.67$\\times$ memory savings\ncompared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, which demonstrates superior\nperformance of Diffuser in both expressiveness and efficiency aspects.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-21T08:13:34Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-31T15:57:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. SPP: Sparsity-Preserved Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Yuhui Xu, Renrui Zhang, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing the field of\nartificial intelligence, yet their immense sizes pose significant challenges\nfor both fine-tuning and deployment. Current post-training pruning methods,\nwhile reducing the sizes of LLMs, often fail to maintain their original\nperformance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SPP, a\nSparsity-Preserved Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Different from\nexisting post-training pruning approaches that struggle with performance\nretention, SPP proposes to employ lightweight learnable column and row matrices\nto optimize sparse LLM weights, keeping the structure and sparsity of pruned\npre-trained models intact. By element-wise multiplication and residual\naddition, SPP ensures the consistency of model sparsity pattern and ratio\nduring both training and weight-merging processes. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SPP by applying it to the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 model families\nwith recent post-training pruning methods. Our results show that SPP\nsignificantly enhances the performance of models with different sparsity\npatterns (i.e. unstructured and N:M sparsity), especially for those with high\nsparsity ratios (e.g. 75%), making it a promising solution for the efficient\nfine-tuning of sparse LLMs. Code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/Lucky-Lance/SPP.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-25T04:55:27Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-25T04:55:27Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. DSEE: Dually Sparsity-embedded Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Language\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Weizhu Chen, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, Zhangyang Wang, Yu Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Gigantic pre-trained models have become central to natural language\nprocessing (NLP), serving as the starting point for fine-tuning towards a range\nof downstream tasks. However, two pain points persist for this paradigm: (a) as\nthe pre-trained models grow bigger (e.g., 175B parameters for GPT-3), even the\nfine-tuning process can be time-consuming and computationally expensive; (b)\nthe fine-tuned model has the same size as its starting point by default, which\nis neither sensible due to its more specialized functionality, nor practical\nsince many fine-tuned models will be deployed in resource-constrained\nenvironments. To address these pain points, we propose a framework for\nresource- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning by leveraging the sparsity prior\nin both weight updates and the final model weights. Our proposed framework,\ndubbed Dually Sparsity-Embedded Efficient Tuning (DSEE), aims to achieve two\nkey objectives: (i) parameter efficient fine-tuning - by enforcing\nsparsity-aware low-rank updates on top of the pre-trained weights; and (ii)\nresource-efficient inference - by encouraging a sparse weight structure towards\nthe final fine-tuned model. We leverage sparsity in these two directions by\nexploiting both unstructured and structured sparse patterns in pre-trained\nlanguage models via a unified approach. Extensive experiments and in-depth\ninvestigations, with diverse network backbones (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2)\non dozens of datasets, consistently demonstrate impressive\nparameter-/inference-efficiency, while maintaining competitive downstream\nperformance. For instance, DSEE saves about 25% inference FLOPs while achieving\ncomparable performance, with 0.5% trainable parameters on BERT.

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression transformers\"*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race\ntowards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on\nend-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM\ncompression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits\nper parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook\nQuantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic\nAdditive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the\nstate-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive\nquantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint\noptimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly,\nAQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of\naccuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and\nsignificantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit)\nregime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU\nimplementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or\noutperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much\nsmaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11T18:54:44Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-11T07:48:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Emergent Properties of Finetuned Language Representation Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression transformers\"*\n\n*Alexandre Matton, Luke de Oliveira*\n\n**Abstract:** Large, self-supervised transformer-based language representation models have\nrecently received significant amounts of attention, and have produced\nstate-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks simply by scaling up\npre-training on larger and larger corpora. Such models usually produce high\ndimensional vectors, on top of which additional task-specific layers and\narchitectural modifications are added to adapt them to specific downstream\ntasks. Though there exists ample evidence that such models work well, we aim to\nunderstand what happens when they work well. We analyze the redundancy and\nlocation of information contained in output vectors for one such language\nrepresentation model -- BERT. We show empirical evidence that the [CLS]\nembedding in BERT contains highly redundant information, and can be compressed\nwith minimal loss of accuracy, especially for finetuned models, dovetailing\ninto open threads in the field about the role of over-parameterization in\nlearning. We also shed light on the existence of specific output dimensions\nwhich alone give very competitive results when compared to using all dimensions\nof output vectors.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-23T23:01:10Z  (*Updated: 2019-10-23T23:01:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention transformer\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*Xinchao Wang, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Jeff Pool, Greg Heinrich, Saurav Muralidharan, Hongxu Yin, Gongfan Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their massive parameter counts, which typically result in significant redundancy. This work introduces MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or ``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2) Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL solely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's learnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4 sparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

A Simple and Effective Pruning Approach for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"structured sparsity language models\"*\n\n*J. Zico Kolter, Anna Bair, Zhuang Liu, MingJie Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance. Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive state compression transformers\"*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

However, based on the search results, there is no direct evidence that this specific sparsity pattern has been applied to attention and feed-forward layers within language models. This suggests that integrating pixelated butterfly structures into these components of language models could be a novel contribution.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Adaptive State Compression**\n\n  Adaptive state compression is an essential technique for reducing memory usage in large models. Guo et al. (2023) and Tao et al. (2022) discuss methods for compressing models through distillation and quantization, focusing on maintaining performance while reducing model size. The proposal's adaptive state compression aims to dynamically compress states, potentially offering memory savings without significant performance loss. Comparing the proposed method with existing techniques will help assess its effectiveness.\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling Strategies for Efficiency**\n\n  Dao et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of IO-aware algorithms in optimizing attention computations, leading to significant memory and speed improvements. Applying IO-aware tiling strategies to PixelSparseLM could align computation patterns with hardware capabilities, such as minimizing memory access latency and maximizing tensor core utilization, thus enhancing efficiency.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance**\n\n  While focusing on efficiency, it is critical that the proposed architectural changes do not degrade model quality. Techniques like SmoothQuant (Xiao et al., 2022) and FlexGen (Sheng et al., 2023) demonstrate that hardware-efficient methods can maintain or even improve performance when carefully designed. The proposal's emphasis on maintaining model quality through \"careful hardware-aware design choices and optimized sparse computation patterns\" is promising.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**\n\n  There is a clear trend towards developing hardware-efficient language models to address the challenges posed by large-scale models.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/52 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473, 2014.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Daniel Y.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/67 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2205.01580, 2022.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07258, 2021.

Gradient-based Intra-attention Pruning on Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention language models\"*\n\n*Ziqing Yang, Yiming Cui, Xin Yao, Shijin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models achieve superior performance but are computationally expensive. Techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation have been developed to reduce their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models. Different from common approaches that prune each attention head as a whole, GRAIN inspects and prunes intra-attention structures, which greatly expands the structure search space and enables more flexible models. We also propose a gradient separation strategy that reduces the interference of distillation on pruning for a better combination of the two approaches. Experiments on GLUE, SQuAD, and CoNLL 2003 show that GRAIN notably outperforms other methods, especially in the high sparsity regime, and achieves 6 7x speedups while maintaining 93% 99% performance. Under extreme compression where only 3% transformer weights remain, the pruned model is still competitive compared to larger models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3. LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention language models\"*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4.

We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Approximating Two-Layer Feedforward Networks for Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformers\"*\n\n*R'obert Csord'as, Kazuki Irie, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces several novel perspectives on MoEs, presenting a general framework that unifies various methods to approximate two-layer NNs, including product-key memories (PKMs), and proposes methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs.\n\n**Abstract:** How to reduce compute and memory requirements of neural networks (NNs) without sacrificing performance? Many recent works use sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) to build resource-efficient large language models (LMs). Here we introduce several novel perspectives on MoEs, presenting a general framework that unifies various methods to approximate two-layer NNs (e.g., feedforward blocks of Transformers), including product-key memories (PKMs). Leveraging insights from this framework, we propose methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs. Unlike prior work that compares MoEs with dense baselines under the compute-equal condition, our evaluation condition is parameter-equal, which is crucial to properly evaluate LMs. We show that our MoEs are competitive with the dense Transformer-XL on both the WikiText-103 and enwiki8 datasets at two different scales, while being much more resource efficient. This demonstrates that MoEs are relevant not only to extremely large LMs but also to any-scale resource-efficient LMs. Our code is public.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention language models\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We investigate whether self-attention in\nlarge-scale pre-trained language models is as predictive of human eye fixation\npatterns during task-reading as classical cognitive models of human attention.\nWe compare attention functions across two task-specific reading datasets for\nsentiment analysis and relation extraction. We find the predictiveness of\nlarge-scale pre-trained self-attention for human attention depends on `what is\nin the tail', e.g., the syntactic nature of rare contexts. Further, we observe\nthat task-specific fine-tuning does not increase the correlation with human\ntask-specific reading. Through an input reduction experiment we give\ncomplementary insights on the sparsity and fidelity trade-off, showing that\nlower-entropy attention vectors are more faithful.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-25T08:23:13Z  (*Updated: 2022-04-25T08:23:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Diffuser: Efficient Transformers with Multi-hop Attention Diffusion for\n  Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformers\"*\n\n*Aosong Feng, Irene Li, Yuang Jiang, Rex Ying*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient Transformers have been developed for long sequence modeling, due to\ntheir subquadratic memory and time complexity. Sparse Transformer is a popular\napproach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting\nself-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns.\nHowever, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to\nfull-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To\ncombine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the\nexpressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \\textit{Diffuser}, a\nnew state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token\ninteractions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and\nmemory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention\nusing Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on\nall paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among\nneighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a\nuniversal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and\ninvestigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph\nexpander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate\nthe effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language\nmodeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA). Evaluation results show\nthat Diffuser achieves improvements by an average of 0.94% on text\nclassification tasks and 2.30% on LRA, with 1.67$\\times$ memory savings\ncompared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, which demonstrates superior\nperformance of Diffuser in both expressiveness and efficiency aspects.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-21T08:13:34Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-31T15:57:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Surprisingly, the sparse\nlayers are enough to obtain the same perplexity as the standard Transformer\nwith the same number of parameters.

MobileBERT: a Compact Task-Agnostic BERT for Resource-Limited Devices\n\n*From Search Query: \"pixelated butterfly structured attention\"*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Hongkun Yu, Xiaodan Song, Renjie Liu, Yiming Yang, Denny Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by\nusing huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However,\nthese models suffer from heavy model sizes and high latency such that they\ncannot be deployed to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we\npropose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model.\nLike the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be\ngenerically applied to various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning.\nBasically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while equipped with\nbottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions\nand feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially\ndesigned teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE model.\nThen, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical\nstudies show that MobileBERT is 4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE\nwhile achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the natural\nlanguage inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUEscore o 77.7 (0.6\nlower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms latency on a Pixel 4 phone.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal\nrepresentations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to\ngenerate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are\nthen able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving\nthe memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new\nalgorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a\ndynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for\nencoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic\nseq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document\nclassification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory\nefficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and\nconsistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as\nSparse Transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-26T04:18:01Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"butterfly sparsity attention language models\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. An Efficient Sparse Inference Software Accelerator for Transformer-based Language Models on CPUs\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformers\"*\n\n*Moshe Wasserblat, Guy Boudoukh, Ziheng Wang, Qun Gao, Hanwen Chang, Yu Luo, Yi Ding, Ofir Zafrir, Zhe Wang, Bo Dong, Hengyu Meng, Haihao Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, Transformer-based language models have become the standard approach for natural language processing tasks. However, stringent throughput and latency requirements in industrial applications are limiting their adoption. To mitigate the gap, model compression techniques such as structured pruning are being used to improve inference efficiency. However, most existing neural network inference runtimes lack adequate support for structured sparsity. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse deep learning inference software stack for Transformer-based language models where the weights are pruned with constant block size. Our sparse software accelerator leverages Intel Deep Learning Boost to maximize the performance of sparse matrix - dense matrix multiplication (commonly abbreviated as SpMM) on CPUs. Our SpMM kernel outperforms the existing sparse libraries (oneMKL, TVM, and LIBXSMM) by an order of magnitude on a wide range of GEMM shapes under 5 representative sparsity ratios (70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%). Moreover, our SpMM kernel shows up to 5x speedup over dense GEMM kernel of oneDNN, a well-optimized dense library widely used in industry. We apply our sparse accelerator on widely-used Transformer-based language models including Bert-Mini, DistilBERT, Bert-Base, and BERT-Large. Our sparse inference software shows up to 1.5x speedup over Neural Magic's Deepsparse under same configurations on Xeon on Amazon Web Services under proxy production latency constraints. We also compare our solution with two framework-based inference solutions, ONNX Runtime and PyTorch, and demonstrate up to 37x speedup over ONNX Runtime and 345x over PyTorch on Xeon under the latency constraints.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient sparse transformers\"*\n\n*Mohammad Saffar, David Grangier, Ashish Vaswani, Aurko Roy*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to $O\\left(n^{1.5}d\\right)$ from $O\\left(n^2d\\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and hidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Novelty and Application of Pixelated Butterfly Sparsity in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Current State of Butterfly Sparsity**: The researcher should verify if any recent publications (late 2023 to 2024) have applied butterfly sparsity patterns specifically to transformer attention mechanisms.

Chen et al. (2021) introduced pixelated butterfly sparsity for neural networks, demonstrating efficiency gains in training with no loss of accuracy. However, existing literature does not indicate that this sparsity pattern has been specifically applied to attention layers within transformers. This suggests that the PixelSparseLM proposal may offer a novel contribution by integrating pixelated butterfly sparsity into attention and feed-forward layers, potentially leading to significant computational efficiency improvements.\n\n- **Adaptive State Compression Techniques**\n\n  Guo et al. (2023) and related works propose adaptive methods for compressing models, focusing on knowledge distillation and contrastive losses. The proposal's adaptive state compression aims to dynamically compress states during model operation. Comparing this with existing methods, the key differentiator may be the integration of compression into the model's operation, rather than as a post-processing or training phase. Additionally, methods like SPP (Lu et al., 2024) emphasize preserving sparsity during fine-tuning, which aligns conceptually with adaptive state compression.\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling Strategies and Hardware Utilization**\n\n  FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) demonstrates that attention computations can be optimized through IO-aware algorithms, leading to significant speedups and memory efficiency. Extending these concepts, the proposal incorporates IO-aware tiling strategies, potentially improving data locality and tensor core utilization. This alignment with hardware capabilities is crucial for achieving practical performance gains, particularly in modern GPUs designed with specific architectural features.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance Metrics**\n\n  Several references indicate that it is possible to achieve significant sparsity and compression without compromising model accuracy. For instance, SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) achieves up to 50% sparsity with minimal accuracy loss. Similarly, Combiner (Ren et al., 2021) provides full attention capabilities with lower computational cost. These insights support the feasibility of the PixelSparseLM proposal in maintaining or even improving model performance while enhancing efficiency.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**\n\n  There is a clear trend toward making large language models more efficient through sparsity, compression, and hardware-aware optimizations. The proposal aligns with this trend by integrating structured sparsity patterns, adaptive compression, and hardware-specific strategies into the language model architecture. This holistic approach addresses both algorithmic efficiency and practical implementation considerations, potentially positioning PixelSparseLM at the forefront of efficient language model design.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan**\n\nTo further solidify the assessment and ensure comprehensive coverage of existing work, the following steps are planned:\n\n- **Deepen Investigation into Butterfly and Structured Sparsity in Attention**\n\n  - Search for any very recent (late 2023 to 2024) publications or preprints that may have applied butterfly sparsity patterns specifically to transformer attention mechanisms.\n  - Investigate patents or industry publications that might not be widely cited in academic literature.\n\n- **Compare with Other Sparse Attention Mechanisms**\n\n  - Explore other efficient attention mechanisms like Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019), Longformer, and Performer to understand how PixelSparseLM's approach differs or improves upon these methods.\n\n- **Assess Practical Implementation and Optimization Techniques**\n\n  - Look into practical considerations of implementing pixelated butterfly sparsity on existing hardware, including potential challenges and solutions.\n  - Evaluate any available benchmarks or case studies demonstrating the real-world performance of similar strategies.\n\n- **Examine Advances in State Compression and IO-Aware Algorithms**\n\n  - Seek out recent advancements in adaptive state compression that may offer insights or alternative approaches.\n  - Investigate further into IO-aware algorithms and their applicability to other aspects of transformer models.\n\n5. **List of References**\n\n- Anagnostidis, S., Pavllo, D., Biggio, L., Noci, L., Lucchi, A., & Hofmann, T.
