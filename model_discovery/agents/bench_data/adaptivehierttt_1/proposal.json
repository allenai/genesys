Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Introduction\n\nRecently, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have shown immense capability in sequential modeling and been widely used in various areas, such as natural language processing\n\n[^0](Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), time series analysis (Zhou et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021b; Janner et al., 2021). Based on attention mechanisms, Transformers can learn the relation between each pair of tokens in a sequence. However, suffering from the quadratic complexity of pairwise relation modeling, it is computationally prohibitive for Transformers to deal with long sequences and scale up to bigger models. To tackle this essential obstacle for foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), efficient and linear Transformers have been explored. One category of methods attempts to utilize the sparsity to reduce the model captured relations (Child et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020). By substituting the dense matrix to a sparse version, these models can obtain a lower complexity but inevitably sacrifice some valuable information, leading to the trade-off dilemma between efficiency and performance. Another mainstream category tries to abandon the computationconsuming query-key multiplication in the attention mechanism. The typical method is to substitute or approximate the softmax-based similarity in Transformers. For example, Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) introduces the decomposition method for similarity calculation and further bypasses the query-key multiplication through the associativity of matrix multiplication. However, without using the softmax function, these methods cannot guarantee the distinguishability of attention. This may result in nearuniform attention of each token to all other tokens, namely the degenerated attention, which damages the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. Although some works try to incorporate the concentration property to avoid the trivial attention (Luo et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2022), they have to reintroduce specific inductive biases to Transformers, such as the locality in sequence, sacrificing the model generality. Thus, how to simultaneously obtain the non-trivial attention and maintain the generality as the canonical attention is the key challenge in the advance of linearizing Transformers. Previous works demonstrate that the softmax function is essential to avoid the trivial attention (Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021). It is well-known that the softmax function is originally proposed as a differentiable generalization of the \"winner-take-all\" picking maximum operation (Bridle, 1989). Thus, the softmax function can introduce\nthe competition among tokens in the attention mechanism, enforcing higher attention only to the essential tokens and thereby avoiding near-uniform attention weights. Based on this insight, it is a natural solution to empower transformers with built-in competition property to generate informative attention that guarantees the modeling capability. However, the competition mechanism is irrealizable for linear Transformers because the attention weights to compete will incur the quadratic complexity. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we attempt to reconstruct the attention mechanism from a new view of flow network (Ahuja et al., 1993), where the competition property is naturally achieved. Note that a flow network is a directed graph with information flows from one node to another under the constraint of flow capacity. Correspondingly, the attention mechanism can be reformulated as aggregating the information from sources (i.e., values) to sinks (i.e., results) through the learned flow capacities (i.e., attentions). We further find that by conserving the incoming flow capacity for each sink, the outgoing flow capacities of sources will compete with each other. And by conserving the outgoing flow capacity of sources, we can also obtain the competed incoming flow capacities of sinks. Thus, benefiting from the flow conservation in flow network, the competition mechanism can be accomplished without specific inductive biases. Based on the above insights, we introduce the flow conservation to the attention mechanism and further propose the Flow-Attention mechanism, which can avoid the trivial attention and simultaneously be free from specific inductive biases. Technically, by conserving the incoming flow of sinks (i.e., results), the source competition mechanism is accomplished and then applied for the non-trivial information aggregation. After the information aggregation, the sink allocation mechanism is obtained by conserving the outgoing flow of sources (i.e., values) and then applied to filter the aggregated information. Empowered by the Flow-Attention, Flowformer in linear complexity achieves competitive or better performance as the canonical Transformer in extensive areas. The contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- This paper analyzes the attention mechanism from the new view of the flow network. By introducing the flow conservation to both the source and sink aspects, the competition among tokens is naturally achieved. - Based on flow conservation, we propose the FlowAttention with source competition and sink allocation mechanisms, which can avoid degenerated attentions without incorporating specific inductive biases. - Empowered by Flow-Attention, our proposed Flowformer yields strong performance in linear time on five benchmarks, covering wide areas: long sequence, language, vision, time series and reinforcement learning.\n```\n\n#### 5.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention softmax-free state-space\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention softmax-free state-space*\n\n*Jiachen Lu, Jinghan Yao, Junge Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Hang Xu, Weiguo Gao, Chunjing Xu, T. Xiang, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** For the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants and allows much longer token sequences to be permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by self-attention. However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 132  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention softmax-free state-space*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. cosFormer: Rethinking Softmax in Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention softmax-free state-space*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Huicai Deng, Dongxu Li, Yunshen Wei, Baohong Lv, Junjie Yan, Lingpeng Kong, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A linear transformer called cosFormer is proposed that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions and is based on two key properties of softmax attention: non-negativeness of the attention matrix and a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the Attention matrix.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has shown great successes in natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention softmax-free state-space*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on linear attention mechanisms, softmax-free transformers, and state-space models, here are some key technical details and integration approaches:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficiency and Formulation\nLinear attention mechanisms aim to reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional softmax-based attention. One approach is to use dot-product attention without softmax, which can be formulated using structured state-space models (SSMs). For example, the Mamba-2 architecture generalizes linear attention using SSMs, where the attention mechanism is expressed in a recurrent form that can be equivalently represented as a matrix multiplication. This formulation allows for efficient training and inference by avoiding the quadratic complexity of softmax attention.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\nThe linear attention in Mamba-2 can be expressed as:\n\\[ O = (QK^\\top \\odot M_L)V \\]\nwhere \\(Q\\), \\(K\\), and \\(V\\) are the query, key, and value matrices, and \\(M_L\\) is a 1-semiseparable matrix encoding temporal dependencies. This formulation simplifies the attention computation to linear time complexity.\n\n## Softmax-Free Transformers\n\n### Gaussian Kernel Function\nTo remove the softmax function in self-attention, Gaussian kernel functions can be used to replace the dot-product similarity. This approach, as seen in the SOFT (Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity) model, enables the full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition, maintaining effectiveness while improving efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Fast Weight Programming\nLinear attention mechanisms can also be viewed as fast weight programmers, which learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. This perspective suggests new ways to handle memory in autoregressive models, potentially enhancing their ability to capture long-range dependencies[Analysis Note].\n\n## State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n### Integration with Attention\nSSMs can be integrated with attention mechanisms to create hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both approaches. For example, the Zamba model combines a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. This hybrid architecture can enhance feature representation and efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\nSSMs can be formulated using partial differential equations (PDEs) or structured state-space duality (SSD). The PDE-inspired model captures the continuous flow of information, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how information evolves over time and across layers. For instance:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D\\nabla^2 u + \\alpha A(u) + R(u, \\theta, t, x) \\]\nwhere \\(u(x, t)\\) represents the d-dimensional embedding of the token at position \\(x\\) and time \\(t\\), \\(D\\nabla^2 u\\) captures the diffusion of information, \\(A(u)\\) denotes the self-attention mechanism, and \\(R(u, \\theta, t, x)\\) represents residual connections.\n\n## Efficiency Characteristics and Integration Approaches\n\n### Efficiency\nLinear attention and softmax-free approaches significantly improve the efficiency of autoregressive models by reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. This is particularly beneficial for long sequences and large models, as it allows for faster training and inference times[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nCombining linear attention with state-space models can enhance hierarchical processing. By using adaptive mechanisms, these models can better handle long sequences and capture complex dependencies. The use of PDE-inspired formulations can also provide a robust mathematical framework for analyzing the dynamics of these models[Analysis Note].\n\n### Memory Management\nIntegrating fast weight programming concepts can help in managing memory efficiently. These models learn to manipulate memory contents dynamically, which is crucial for autoregressive models that need to maintain context over long sequences[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the integration of linear attention mechanisms, softmax-free approaches, and state-space models offers a promising direction for improving autoregressive language models. These approaches can enhance efficiency, capture complex dependencies, and manage memory effectively, all of which are critical for achieving better performance and scalability.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Network Memory Footprint Compression Through Jointly Learnable Codebooks and Mappings\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization*\n\n*Edouard Yvinec, Arnaud Dapogny, K\u00e9vin Bailly*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Abstract:** The massive interest in deep neural networks (DNNs) for both computer vision and natural language processing has been sparked by the growth in computational power. However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point where it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as mobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution as it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format. In terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based on codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they either define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive mapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the mapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal search. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we initially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered structure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or map weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping overhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint learning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with recent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing estimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel gradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and their mappings. The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. AC-GC: Lossy Activation Compression with Guaranteed Convergence\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization*\n\n*R. Evans, Tor M. Aamodt*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper builds upon recent developments on Stochastic Gradient Descent convergence to prove an upper bound on the expected loss increase when training with compressed activation storage, and expresses activation compression error in terms of this bound, allowing the compression rate to adapt to training conditions automatically.\n\n**Abstract:** Parallel hardware devices (e.g., graphics processor units) have limited high-bandwidth memory capacity. This negatively impacts the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by increasing runtime and/or decreasing accuracy when reducing model and/or batch size to \ufb01t this capacity. Lossy compression is a promising approach to tackling memory capacity constraints, but prior approaches rely on hyperparameter search to achieve a suitable trade-off between convergence and compression, negating runtime bene\ufb01ts. In this paper we build upon recent developments on Stochastic Gradient Descent convergence to prove an upper bound on the expected loss increase when training with compressed activation storage. We then express activation compression error in terms of this bound, allowing the compression rate to adapt to training conditions automatically. The advantage of our approach, called AC-GC, over existing lossy compression frameworks is that, given a preset allowable increase in loss, signi\ufb01cant compression without signi\ufb01cant increase in error can be achieved with a single training run. When combined with error-bounded methods, AC-GC achieves 15.1 \u00d7 compression with an average accuracy change of 0 . 1% on text and image datasets. AC-GC functions on any model composed of the layers analyzed and, by avoiding compression rate search, reduces overall training time by 4.6 \u00d7 over SuccessiveHalving.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Channel-spatial Encoding for Communication-efficient Collaborative Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization*\n\n*Qihua Zhou, Song Guo, Yi Liu, J. Zhang, Jiewei Zhang, Tao Guo, Zhenda Xu, Xun Liu, Zhihao Qu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper takes new insights into implementing scalable CL systems through a hierarchical compression on features, termed Stripe-wise Group Quantization (SGQ), which achieves a higher traffic reduction ratio and provides 9 .\n\n**Abstract:** It witnesses that the collaborative learning (CL) systems often face the performance bottleneck of limited bandwidth, where multiple low-end devices continuously generate data and transmit intermediate features to the cloud for incremental training. To this end, improving the communication efficiency by reducing traffic size is one of the most crucial issues for realistic deployment. Existing systems mostly compress features at pixel level and ignore the characteristics of feature structure, which could be further exploited for more efficient compression. In this paper, we take new insights into implementing scalable CL systems through a hierarchical compression on features, termed Stripe-wise Group Quantization (SGQ). Different from previous unstructured quantization methods, SGQ captures both channel and spatial similarity in pixels, and simultaneously encodes features in these two levels to gain a much higher compression ratio. In particular, we refactor feature structure based on inter-channel similarity and bound the gradient deviation caused by quantization, in forward and backward passes, respectively. Such a double-stage pipeline makes SGQ hold a sublinear convergence order as the vanilla SGD-based optimization. Extensive experiments show that SGQ achieves a higher traffic reduction ratio by up to 15 . 97 \u00d7 and provides 9 . 22 \u00d7 image processing speedup over the uniform quantized training, while preserving adequate model accuracy as FP32 does, even using 4-bit quantization. This verifies that SGQ can be applied to a wide spectrum of edge intelligence applications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. HiPPO: Recurrent Memory with Optimal Polynomial Projections\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression hierarchical processing gradient stabilization*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale and enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 338  (*Influential: 42*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory compression, hierarchical processing, and gradient stabilization, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Memory Compression\n\n### BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control\nThe BitStack approach introduced in the paper \"BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control for Compressed Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments\" offers a novel weight compression method. This method enables dynamic adjustment of the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices, which is crucial for memory-efficient deployments. BitStack iteratively decomposes weight matrices, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block, which can be sorted and stacked in storage. This technique can help in reducing memory usage without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Pyramid KV Cache Compression\nThe PyramidInfer method proposed in \"Pyramid KV Cache Compression for High-throughput LLM Inference\" focuses on compressing the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context. This approach reduces GPU memory usage by computing fewer keys and values, which is essential for real-time applications. By retaining only the most influential keys and values, PyramidInfer achieves significant memory savings without sacrificing performance, making it a viable option for memory-efficient inference.\n\n### Quantization Techniques\nQuantization methods, such as those discussed in \"AI Model Compression Techniques\" and \"Foundations of Large Language Model Compression -- Part 1,\" involve reducing the precision of model weights. Techniques like Generalized Post-Training Quantization (GPTQ) and bitsandbytes can convert weights from 16-bit to lower bit-widths (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit), significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining performance. These methods are particularly useful for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n\n### State-Space Models (SSMs)\nThe integration of state-space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, as discussed in \"Transformers are SSMs,\" offers a promising direction. SSMs can be designed to be 2-8X faster than traditional transformers while maintaining competitive performance. This framework allows for hierarchical processing by refining selective SSMs, which can be more efficient than traditional transformer architectures[Analysis Note].\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nThe \"Lightning Attention\" approach splits attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks, using conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This block-based processing strategy can enhance efficiency and is a form of hierarchical processing that optimizes attention computation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Gradient Stabilization\n\n### Flow-Based Attention\nThe Flowformer approach casts attention as information flow aggregated from sources to sinks through learned flow capacities. This method applies flow conservation principles to stabilize attention, which naturally handles gradient stability issues without specific inductive biases. Flow-based attention mechanisms can mitigate the problems of unbounded gradients and attention dilution in linear transformers[Analysis Note].\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\nAdaptive normalization techniques can help stabilize gradients in linear attention mechanisms. These techniques, mentioned in the analysis, involve adjusting normalization parameters dynamically to ensure that the gradients remain bounded and stable during training. This is crucial for maintaining the performance and convergence of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n### Gaussian Kernel Functions\nUsing Gaussian kernel functions as softmax-free alternatives, as proposed in \"SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity,\" can help in stabilizing gradients. These functions avoid the unbounded gradients associated with traditional softmax functions, thereby improving the stability of the attention mechanism[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these techniques\u2014such as BitStack for fine-grained memory control, PyramidInfer for KV cache compression, quantization methods for weight precision reduction, SSMs and block-based processing for hierarchical efficiency, and flow-based attention with adaptive normalization for gradient stability\u2014the researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of their autoregressive language model design.\n",

With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at: https://github.com/ WailordHe/DenseSSM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/28 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n2010.

Optimization-Induced Graph Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections training stability hardware optimization*\n\n*Qi Chen, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang, Jiansheng Yang, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the learned representation can be formalized as the minimizer of an explicit convex optimization objective, and embedded prior properties to the equilibrium, as well as introducing skip connections to promote training stability.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the over-smoothing issue, most existing graph neural networks can only capture limited dependencies with their inherently finite aggregation layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new kind of graph convolution, called Graph Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion (GIND), which implicitly has access to infinite hops of neighbors while adaptively aggregating features with nonlinear diffusion to prevent over-smoothing. Notably, we show that the learned representation can be formalized as the minimizer of an explicit convex optimization objective. With this property, we can theoretically characterize the equilibrium of our GIND from an optimization perspective. More interestingly, we can induce new structural variants by modifying the corresponding optimization objective. To be specific, we can embed prior properties to the equilibrium, as well as introducing skip connections to promote training stability. Extensive experiments show that GIND is good at capturing long-range dependencies, and performs well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs with nonlinear diffusion. Moreover, we show that the optimization-induced variants of our models can boost the performance and improve training stability and efficiency as well. As a result, our GIND obtains significant improvements on both node-level and graph-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Outliers with Opposing Signals Have an Outsized Effect on Neural Network Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections training stability hardware optimization*\n\n*Elan Rosenfeld, Andrej Risteski*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new phenomenon in neural network optimization which arises from the interaction of depth and a particular heavy-tailed structure in natural data is identified, offering intuitive explanations for several previously reported observations about network training dynamics and enabling new qualitative predictions of training behavior.\n\n**Abstract:** We identify a new phenomenon in neural network optimization which arises from the interaction of depth and a particular heavy-tailed structure in natural data. Our result offers intuitive explanations for several previously reported observations about network training dynamics. In particular, it implies a conceptually new cause for progressive sharpening and the edge of stability; we also highlight connections to other concepts in optimization and generalization including grokking, simplicity bias, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization. Experimentally, we demonstrate the significant influence of paired groups of outliers in the training data with strong opposing signals: consistent, large magnitude features which dominate the network output throughout training and provide gradients which point in opposite directions. Due to these outliers, early optimization enters a narrow valley which carefully balances the opposing groups; subsequent sharpening causes their loss to rise rapidly, oscillating between high on one group and then the other, until the overall loss spikes. We describe how to identify these groups, explore what sets them apart, and carefully study their effect on the network's optimization and behavior. We complement these experiments with a mechanistic explanation on a toy example of opposing signals and a theoretical analysis of a two-layer linear network on a simple model. Our finding enables new qualitative predictions of training behavior which we confirm experimentally. It also provides a new lens through which to study and improve modern training practices for stochastic optimization, which we highlight via a case study of Adam versus SGD.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. DSD: Dense-Sparse-Dense Training for Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections training stability hardware optimization*\n\n*Song Han, Jeff Pool, Sharan Narang, Huizi Mao, E. Gong, Shijian Tang, Erich Elsen, P\u00e9ter Vajda, Manohar Paluri, J. Tran, Bryan Catanzaro, W. Dally*\n\n**TL;DR:** DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition and effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding a better solution.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them very hard to train. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks and achieving better optimization performance. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.2% and ResNet-50 by 1.1%, respectively. On the WSJ'93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech and DeepSpeech2 WER by 2.0% and 1.1%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. DSD is easy to use in practice: at training time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S step. At testing time, DSD doesn't change the network architecture or incur any inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD experiments shows the inadequacy of the current training methods for finding the best local optimum, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding a better solution.

Its training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works) to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly optimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared to existing MoE inference solutions. DeepSpeed-MoE offers an unprecedented scale and efficiency to serve massive MoE models with up to 4.5x faster and 9x cheaper inference compared to quality-equivalent dense models. We hope our innovations and systems help open a promising path to new directions in the large model landscape, a shift from dense to sparse MoE models, where training and deploying higher-quality models with fewer resources becomes more widely possible.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 213  (*Influential: 24*)\n\n#### 5. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dense connections training stability hardware optimization*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

In DenseNet, each layer connects to every other layer, ensuring that the feature maps from all preceding layers are used as inputs to subsequent layers. This approach can be applied to language models by densely connecting the hidden states of different layers, similar to the concept in \"DenseMamba\" where dense hidden connections in state space models enhance the flow of information between layers.\n\n2. **Residual Connections**:\n   Residual connections, as seen in ResNet and Transformer models, can also be utilized to improve the flow of information through the network. These connections help in stabilizing the training process by allowing the network to learn residual functions, which can mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n### Training Stability Mechanisms\n\n1. **Residual Learning**:\n   Residual learning, as mentioned in the context of ResNet, involves re-parameterizing the layers to learn residual functions. This approach helps in stabilizing the training of deep networks by allowing the layers to learn identity mappings if necessary, thus reducing the degradation problem associated with deep networks.\n\n2. **Normalization Techniques**:\n   Techniques such as batch normalization or layer normalization are crucial for stabilizing the training process. These methods normalize the inputs to each layer, which helps in reducing the internal covariate shift and improving the stability of the training process.\n\n3. **Gradient Stabilization**:\n   Methods like gradient clipping, gradient normalization, or using adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam, AdamW) can help in stabilizing the gradients during training. These techniques prevent the gradients from exploding or vanishing, ensuring more stable and efficient training.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Model Pruning and Quantization**:\n   Techniques such as model pruning and quantization can significantly reduce the computational and memory requirements of the model. By pruning less important weights and quantizing the model parameters, the model can be made more efficient for deployment on hardware with limited resources.\n\n2. **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n   Optimizations like sparse attention or low-rank approximations of attention matrices can reduce the computational cost and memory usage of attention mechanisms in language models. For example, the \"Loki\" approach uses low-rank keys for efficient sparse attention.\n\n3. **Hierarchical and Modular Design**:\n   Designing the model with a hierarchical and modular structure can facilitate better scalability and efficiency. This includes using dense connections, selective state updates, and hybrid memory mechanisms, which can be optimized for specific hardware constraints.\n\n### Integration and Implementation Considerations\n\n1. **Hybrid Memory Mechanisms**:\n   Combining different types of memory mechanisms, such as eidetic and fading memory, as in \"B'MOJO,\" can help in balancing short-term and long-term dependencies. This hybrid approach can be integrated with dense connections and other optimization techniques to enhance overall performance.\n\n2. **Lossless Compression**:\n   Implementing lossless compression techniques, like those in \"LoMA,\" can reduce the memory requirements of the model without compromising performance. This is particularly useful for large language models where memory efficiency is critical.\n\n3. **Hardware-Aware Training**:\n   Training the model with hardware-aware considerations, such as using mixed precision training or optimizing for specific GPU architectures, can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of the model. This involves careful tuning of hyperparameters and optimization algorithms to match the hardware capabilities.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014dense connections, residual learning, normalization, gradient stabilization, model pruning, efficient attention mechanisms, and hardware-aware optimizations\u2014the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that is not only more efficient and scalable but also more robust and accurate.\n",

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 4. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts (Avg.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/40 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\n# Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts \n\nAlexis Chevalier* Alexander Wettig* Anirudh Ajith Danqi Chen<br>Department of Computer Science \\& Princeton Language and Intelligence<br>Princeton University<br>\\{achevalier, anirudh.ajith\\}@princeton.edu<br>\\{awettig, danqic\\}@cs.princeton.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents.\n```\n\n#### 5. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization For Open Set Detection from Imbalanced Data\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Hitesh Sapkota, Qi Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization (AREO) is proposed that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO).\n\n**Abstract:** Open set detection (OSD) aims at identifying data samples of an unknown class ( i.e., open set) from those of known classes ( i.e., closed set) based on a model trained from closed set samples. However, a closed set may involve a highly imbalanced class distribution. Accurately differentiating open set samples and those from a minority class in the closed set poses a fundamental challenge as the model may be equally uncertain when recognizing samples from the minority class. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization (AREO) that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO). To avoid the model to primarily focus on the most difficult samples by following the standard DRO, adaptive DRO training is performed, which is governed by a novel multi-scheduler learning mechanism to ensure an optimal model training behavior that gives sufficient attention to the difficult samples and the minority class while capable of learning common patterns from the majority classes. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outputs uncertainty scores that can clearly separate samples from closed and open sets, respectively, and the detection results outperform the competitive baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Recent advancements in the field provide several mechanisms for speeding up the training, including {\\em compressed communication}, {\\em variance reduction} and {\\em acceleration}. However, none of these methods is capable of exploiting the inherently rich data-dependent smoothness structure of the local losses beyond standard smoothness constants. In this paper, we argue that when training supervised models, {\\em smoothness matrices} -- information-rich generalizations of the ubiquitous smoothness constants -- can and should be exploited for further dramatic gains, both in theory and practice. In order to further alleviate the communication burden inherent in distributed optimization, we propose a novel communication sparsification strategy that can take full advantage of the smoothness matrices associated with local losses. To showcase the power of this tool, we describe how our sparsification technique can be adapted to three distributed optimization algorithms -- DCGD, DIANA and ADIANA -- yielding significant savings in terms of communication complexity.

Emergent mechanisms for long timescales depend on training curriculum and affect performance in memory tasks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Sina Khajehabdollahi, R. Zeraati, E. Giannakakis, T. Schafer, Georg Martius, Anna Levina*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is suggested that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the brain and in silico excel at solving tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons (single-neuron timescale, $\\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale). However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve $N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights and $\\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple $N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\\tau$ with $N$ and are able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold multiple concurrent memories, keep $\\tau$ constant and develop longer timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Prompt Compression for Large Language Models: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression attention mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Nigel Collier, Yixuan Su, Yinhong Liu, Zongqian Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language tasks typically requires long-form prompts to convey detailed requirements and information, which results in increased memory usage and inference costs. To mitigate these challenges, multiple efficient methods have been proposed, with prompt compression gaining significant research interest. This survey provides an overview of prompt compression techniques, categorized into hard prompt methods and soft prompt methods. First, the technical approaches of these methods are compared, followed by an exploration of various ways to understand their mechanisms, including the perspectives of attention optimization, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), modality integration, and new synthetic language. We also examine the downstream adaptations of various prompt compression techniques. Finally, the limitations of current prompt compression methods are analyzed, and several future directions are outlined, such as optimizing the compression encoder, combining hard and soft prompts methods, and leveraging insights from multimodality.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive compression in attention mechanisms, memory optimization, and hardware efficiency, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Adaptive Compression in Attention Mechanisms\n\n### CompAct: Compressed Activations\nThe CompAct technique introduced in the paper \"CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\" is particularly relevant. This method compresses activations during the forward pass using low-rank compression, which significantly reduces the memory required for storing the compute graph and optimizer states. By using random projection matrices, CompAct avoids additional memory overheads and achieves substantial memory savings, especially for larger models.\n\n### Flash Attention\nFlash Attention is another innovative approach that optimizes the traditional attention mechanism. It enhances memory efficiency and computational speed by leveraging optimized GPU memory utilization. This technique is beneficial for processing long input sequences, a common requirement in many real-world applications. Flash Attention contributes to reduced model size, faster inference times, and better resource management.\n\n## Memory Optimization\n\n### Quantization Techniques\nQuantization is a pivotal technique for optimizing large language models. Post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) can reduce the precision of model weights from 32-bit floating-point to lower precision formats like 8-bit integers. This reduces memory usage and accelerates inference, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Techniques like PagedAttention can further optimize memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks.\n\n### Optimized Memory Access\nThe use of compressed activations and quantization can be combined with optimized memory access patterns. For instance, CompAct's approach to compressing activations during the forward pass can be integrated with hardware-aware memory access strategies to minimize memory usage and improve training efficiency.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nThe introduction of memristor-based in-memory computing accelerators for transformer networks can significantly improve hardware efficiency. These accelerators perform matrix operations in an analog manner, integrating computation into memory, which reduces power consumption and latency. This approach can be particularly beneficial for optimizing the attention mechanism in language models.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimizations\nTechniques like those described in DeepSpeed-MoE, which include novel model compression techniques and highly optimized inference systems, can reduce model size and improve latency. These hardware-aware optimizations can be applied to attention mechanisms to enhance overall efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration and Implementation Considerations\n\n### Dense Connections and Hierarchical State Management\nIntegrating dense connections, as suggested by the DenseMamba approach, can enhance information flow between layers. Combining this with hierarchical state management and adaptive compression techniques can further optimize memory efficiency and improve the overall performance of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n### Training Stability and Gradient Stabilization\nImplementing dense-sparse-dense training patterns and gradient stabilization methods can improve training stability. These techniques, when combined with adaptive compression and hardware-aware optimizations, can ensure that the model trains efficiently and maintains high performance[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory usage, computational speed, and hardware utilization, while maintaining or improving their performance.\n",

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nAydar Bulatov, Yury Kuratov, and Mikhail Burtsev. 2022.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

Bit-Swap: Recursive Bits-Back Coding for Lossless Compression with Hierarchical Latent Variables\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression transformers implementation*\n\n*F. Kingma, P. Abbeel, Jonathan Ho*\n\n**TL;DR:** Bit-Swap is proposed, a new compression scheme that generalizes BB-ANS and achieves strictly better compression rates for hierarchical latent variable models with Markov chain structure and results in lossless compression rates that are empirically superior to existing techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** The bits-back argument suggests that latent variable models can be turned into lossless compression schemes. Translating the bits-back argument into efficient and practical lossless compression schemes for general latent variable models, however, is still an open problem. Bits-Back with Asymmetric Numeral Systems (BB-ANS), recently proposed by Townsend et al. (2019), makes bits-back coding practically feasible for latent variable models with one latent layer, but it is inefficient for hierarchical latent variable models. In this paper we propose Bit-Swap, a new compression scheme that generalizes BB-ANS and achieves strictly better compression rates for hierarchical latent variable models with Markov chain structure. Through experiments we verify that Bit-Swap results in lossless compression rates that are empirically superior to existing techniques.

We use this property, applying fully convolutional models to lossless compression, demonstrating a method to scale the VAE-based 'Bits-Back with ANS' algorithm for lossless compression to large color photographs, and achieving state of the art for compression of full size ImageNet images.

Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression transformers implementation*\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/epfml/landmark-attention/.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 110  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 4.

Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient scale integration techniques*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Fast and Memory Efficient Differentially Private-SGD via JL Projections\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient scale integration techniques*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, Sivakanth Gopi, Janardhan Kulkarni, Y. Lee, Judy Hanwen Shen, U. Tantipongpipat*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an algorithmic solution which works for any network in a black-box manner and trains a Recurrent Neural Network to achieve good privacy-vs-accuracy tradeoff, while being significantly faster than DP-SGD and with a similar memory footprint as non-private SGD.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially Private-SGD (DP-SGD) of Abadi et al. (2016) and its variations are the only known algorithms for private training of large scale neural networks. This algorithm requires computation of per-sample gradients norms which is extremely slow and memory intensive in practice. In this paper, we present a new framework to design differentially private optimizers called DP-SGD-JL and DP-Adam-JL. Our approach uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) projections to quickly approximate the per-sample gradient norms without exactly computing them, thus making the training time and memory requirements of our optimizers closer to that of their non-DP versions. Unlike previous attempts to make DP-SGD faster which work only on a subset of network architectures or use compiler techniques, we propose an algorithmic solution which works for any network in a black-box manner which is the main contribution of this paper. To illustrate this, on IMDb dataset, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to achieve good privacy-vs-accuracy tradeoff, while being significantly faster than DP-SGD and with a similar memory footprint as non-private SGD. The privacy analysis of our algorithms is more involved than DP-SGD, we use the recently proposed f-DP framework of Dong et al. (2019) to prove privacy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

We propose a principled, global interaction detection method by casting our target as a multi-arm bandits problem and solving it swiftly with the UCB algorithm. This adaptive method is free of ad-hoc assumptions and among the cutting-edge methods with outstanding detection accuracy and stability. Based on the detection outcome, a lightweight and interpretable deep learning model (called ParaACE) is further built using the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) method. Our proposed ParaACE improves the prediction performance by 26% and reduces the model size by 100+ times as compared to its Teacher model over various datasets. Furthermore, we show the great potential of our method for scienti\ufb01c discovery through interpreting various real datasets in the economics and smart medicine sectors.

However, we make a key observation that not all features are beneficial, and some may even be harmful, necessitating careful selection. Empirically, we find that many image pairs with small feature spatial distances can have vastly different quality scores, indicating that the extracted features may contain a significant amount of quality-irrelevant noise. To address this issue, we propose a Quality-Aware Feature Matching IQA Metric (QFM-IQM) that employs an adversarial perspective to remove harmful semantic noise features from the upstream task. Specifically, QFM-IQM enhances the semantic noise distinguish capabilities by matching image pairs with similar quality scores but varying semantic features as adversarial semantic noise and adaptively adjusting the upstream task's features by reducing sensitivity to adversarial noise perturbation. Furthermore, we utilize a distillation framework to expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability. Our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods on eight standard IQA datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature compression methods*\n\n*Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive KV cache compression is introduced, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) and demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. The Information Sieve\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression transformers implementation*\n\n*Aram Galstyan, Greg Ver Steeg*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new framework for unsupervised learning of representations\nbased on a novel hierarchical decomposition of information. Intuitively, data\nis passed through a series of progressively fine-grained sieves. Each layer of\nthe sieve recovers a single latent factor that is maximally informative about\nmultivariate dependence in the data. The data is transformed after each pass so\nthat the remaining unexplained information trickles down to the next layer.\nUltimately, we are left with a set of latent factors explaining all the\ndependence in the original data and remainder information consisting of\nindependent noise. We present a practical implementation of this framework for\ndiscrete variables and apply it to a variety of fundamental tasks in\nunsupervised learning including independent component analysis, lossy and\nlossless compression, and predicting missing values in data.\n\n**Published:** 2015-07-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hybrid Voxel Formats for Efficient Ray Tracing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression transformers implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Voxels are a geometric representation used for rendering volumes, multi-resolution models, and indirect lighting effects. Since the memory consumption of uncompressed voxel volumes scales cubically with resolution, past works have introduced data structures for exploiting spatial sparsity and homogeneity to compress volumes and accelerate ray tracing. However, these works don't systematically evaluate the trade-off between compression and ray intersection performance for a variety of storage formats. We show that a hierarchical combination of voxel formats can achieve Pareto optimal trade-offs between memory consumption and rendering speed. We present a formulation of \"hybrid\" voxel formats, where each level of a hierarchical format can have a different structure. For evaluation, we implement a metaprogramming system to automatically generate construction and ray intersection code for arbitrary hybrid formats. We also identify transformations on these formats that can improve compression and rendering performance. We evaluate this system with several models and hybrid formats, demonstrating that compared to standalone base formats, hybrid formats achieve a new Pareto frontier in ray intersection performance and storage cost.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 3.

MMDenseLSTM: An efficient combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for audio source separation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient scale integration techniques*\n\n*Naoya Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji, Nabarun Goswami*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become an indispensable technique for audio source separation (ASS). It was recently reported that a variant of CNN architecture called MMDenseNet was successfully employed to solve the ASS problem of estimating source amplitudes, and state-of-the-art results were obtained for DSD100 dataset. To further enhance MMDenseNet, here we propose a novel architecture that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) in multiple scales with skip connections to efficiently model long-term structures within an audio context. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms MMDenseNet, LSTM and a blend of the two networks. The number of parameters and processing time of the proposed model are significantly less than those for simple blending. Furthermore, the proposed method yields better results than those obtained using ideal binary masks for a singing voice separation task.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature compression methods*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 6. Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature compression methods*\n\n*Yanghui Yan, Ying Fan, Kun Gai, Junqi Jin, Chengru Song, Xiaoqiang Zhu, Han Zhu, Han Li, Xiao Ma, Guorui Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Click-through rate prediction is an essential task in industrial\napplications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models\nhave been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\\&MLP paradigm. In these\nmethods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional\nembedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a\ngroup-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way,\nuser features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in\nregardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a\nbottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\\&MLP methods to capture\nuser's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this\nchallenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the\nrepresentation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a\ncertain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the\nexpressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques:\nmini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can\nhelp training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters.\nExperiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production\ndataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed\napproaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display\nadvertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical compression, memory-efficient scale integration, and adaptive feature compression, here are some key findings and references from recent research:\n\n## Hierarchical Compression in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **LongNet**: This model introduces dilated attention, which allows for exponential expansion of the attentive field as the distance between tokens grows.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 3. CORM: Cache Optimization with Recent Message for Large Language Model Inference (Avg.

Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the memory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a primary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer models, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query vectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely exclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding queries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\\% with negligible performance degradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/18 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06262, 2024.

However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/45 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nLillicrap. 2020.

Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression\n\n*From Search Query: lossless compression language models*\n\n*Tim Dettmers, Ruslan Svirschevski, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Saleh Ashkboos, Alexander Borzunov, T. Hoefler, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to high-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via quantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited devices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However, quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range, which are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for highly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance degradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer without any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding weights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime. Specifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which yields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while enabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 156  (*Influential: 22*)\n\n#### 2. Language Modeling Is Compression\n\n*From Search Query: lossless compression language models*\n\n*Gr'egoire Del'etang, Anian Ruoss, Paul-Ambroise Duquenne, Elliot Catt, Tim Genewein, Christopher Mattern, Jordi Grau-Moya, Wenliang Kevin Li, Matthew Aitchison, Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter, J. Veness*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning and the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor to build a conditional generative model.\n\n**Abstract:** It has long been established that predictive models can be transformed into lossless compressors and vice versa. Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Dodo: Dynamic Contextual Compression for Decoder-only LMs\n\n*From Search Query: lossless compression language models*\n\n*Guanghui Qin, Corby Rosset, Ethan C. Chau, Nikhil Rao, Benjamin Van Durme*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dodo is proposed, a solution for context compression that represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We propose Dodo, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per token in a standard transformer model, Dodo represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA can be adapted to Dodo by efficient parameter tuning methods such as LoRA. In use, Dodo can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context compressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language modeling, question answering, and summarization that Dodo retains capabilities in these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For example, in the autoencoding task, Dodo shrinks context at a 20x compression ratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless encoding.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management transformers*\n\n*Jake Grigsby, Linxi Fan, Yuke Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning, is introduced and demonstrated its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory domains.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning. Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in agents' memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL. Our agent is scalable and applicable to a wide range of problems, and we demonstrate its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory domains. AMAGO's focus on sparse rewards and off-policy data also allows in-context learning to extend to goal-conditioned problems with challenging exploration. When combined with a multi-goal hindsight relabeling scheme, AMAGO can solve a previously difficult category of open-world domains, where agents complete many possible instructions in procedurally generated environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. AdaptFormer: Adapting Vision Transformers for Scalable Visual Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management transformers*\n\n*Shoufa Chen, Chongjian Ge, Zhan Tong, Jiangliu Wang, Yibing Song, Jue Wang, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** AdaptFormer introduces lightweight modules that only add less than 2% extra parameters to a ViT, while it is able to increase the ViT's transferability without updating its original pre-trained parameters, significantly outperforming the existing 100\\% fully fine-tuned models on action recognition benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretraining Vision Transformers (ViTs) has achieved great success in visual recognition. A following scenario is to adapt a ViT to various image and video recognition tasks. The adaptation is challenging because of heavy computation and memory storage. Each model needs an independent and complete finetuning process to adapt to different tasks, which limits its transferability to different visual domains. To address this challenge, we propose an effective adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can adapt the pre-trained ViTs into many different image and video tasks efficiently. It possesses several benefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AdaptFormer introduces lightweight modules that only add less than 2% extra parameters to a ViT, while it is able to increase the ViT's transferability without updating its original pre-trained parameters, significantly outperforming the existing 100\\% fully fine-tuned models on action recognition benchmarks. Secondly, it can be plug-and-play in different Transformers and scalable to many visual tasks. Thirdly, extensive experiments on five image and video datasets show that AdaptFormer largely improves ViTs in the target domains. For example, when updating just 1.5% extra parameters, it achieves about 10% and 19% relative improvement compared to the fully fine-tuned models on Something-Something~v2 and HMDB51, respectively.

Hi-ArG: Exploring the Integration of Hierarchical Argumentation Graphs in Language Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical scale integration*\n\n*Jingcong Liang, Rong Ye, Meng Han, Qi Zhang, Ruofei Lai, Xinyu Zhang, Zhao Cao, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the Hierarchical Argumentation Graph (Hi-ArG), a new structure to organize arguments, and introduces two approaches to exploit Hi-G, including a text-graph multi-modal model GreaseArG and a new pre-training framework augmented with graph information.\n\n**Abstract:** The knowledge graph is a structure to store and represent knowledge, and recent studies have discussed its capability to assist language models for various applications. Some variations of knowledge graphs aim to record arguments and their relations for computational argumentation tasks. However, many must simplify semantic types to fit specific schemas, thus losing flexibility and expression ability. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Argumentation Graph (Hi-ArG), a new structure to organize arguments. We also introduce two approaches to exploit Hi-ArG, including a text-graph multi-modal model GreaseArG and a new pre-training framework augmented with graph information. Experiments on two argumentation tasks have shown that after further pre-training and fine-tuning, GreaseArG supersedes same-scale language models on these tasks, while incorporating graph information during further pre-training can also improve the performance of vanilla language models.

Complex Question Decomposition for Semantic Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical scale integration*\n\n*Haoyu Zhang, Jingjing Cai, Jianjun Xu, J.

Our model is designed within a three-stage parsing architecture based on the idea of decomposition-integration. In the first stage, we propose a question decomposer which decomposes a complex question into a sequence of sub-questions. In the second stage, we design an information extractor to derive the type and predicate information of these questions. In the last stage, we integrate the generated information from previous stages and generate a logical form for the complex question. We conduct experiments on COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS which is a large scale complex question semantic parsing dataset, results show that our model achieves significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 9. Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical scale integration*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available estimates in \\cite{cover1978convergent}, \\cite{lutati2023focus}. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction from the large language model with a lossless compression scheme.

SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: lossless compression language models*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Sheng Shen, Xiuyu Li, Zhen Dong, Amir Gholami, Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

FedML Parrot: A Scalable Federated Learning System via Heterogeneity-aware Scheduling on Sequential and Hierarchical Training\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management transformers*\n\n*Chaoyang He, Salman Avestimehr, Alex Qiaozhong Liang, Yuxin Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Sunwoo Lee, Ryan Yide Ran, Xiaowen Chu, Zhenheng Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborations among clients for train machine learning models while protecting their data privacy. Existing FL simulation platforms that are designed from the perspectives of traditional distributed training, suffer from laborious code migration between simulation and production, low efficiency, low GPU utility, low scalability with high hardware requirements and difficulty of simulating stateful clients. In this work, we firstly demystify the challenges and bottlenecks of simulating FL, and design a new FL system named as FedML \\texttt{Parrot}. It improves the training efficiency, remarkably relaxes the requirements on the hardware, and supports efficient large-scale FL experiments with stateful clients by: (1) sequential training clients on devices; (2) decomposing original aggregation into local and global aggregation on devices and server respectively; (3) scheduling tasks to mitigate straggler problems and enhance computing utility; (4) distributed client state manager to support various FL algorithms. Besides, built upon our generic APIs and communication interfaces, users can seamlessly transform the simulation into the real-world deployment without modifying codes. We evaluate \\texttt{Parrot} through extensive experiments for training diverse models on various FL datasets to demonstrate that \\texttt{Parrot} can achieve simulating over 1000 clients (stateful or stateless) with flexible GPU devices setting ($4 \\sim 32$) and high GPU utility, 1.2 $\\sim$ 4 times faster than FedScale, and 10 $\\sim$ 100 times memory saving than FedML. And we verify that \\texttt{Parrot} works well with homogeneous and heterogeneous devices in three different clusters. Two FL algorithms with stateful clients and four algorithms with stateless clients are simulated to verify the wide adaptability of \\texttt{Parrot} to different algorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. LinFusion: 1 GPU, 1 Minute, 16K Image\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management transformers*\n\n*Xinchao Wang, Zhenxiong Tan, Weihao Yu, Songhua Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern diffusion models, particularly those utilizing a Transformer-based UNet for denoising, rely heavily on self-attention operations to manage complex spatial relationships, thus achieving impressive generation performance. However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and identify two key features--attention normalization and non-causal inference--that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion enables satisfactory and efficient zero-shot cross-resolution generation, accommodating ultra-resolution images like 16K on a single GPU. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components and pipelines, such as ControlNet, IP-Adapter, DemoFusion, DistriFusion, etc, requiring no adaptation efforts.

Selecting efficient and reliable preservation strategies: modeling long-term information integrity using large-scale hierarchical discrete event simulation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical scale integration*\n\n*Richard Landau, Micah Altman*\n\n**Abstract:** This article addresses the problem of formulating efficient and reliable operational preservation policies that ensure bit-level information integrity over long periods, and in the presence of a diverse range of real-world technical, legal, organizational, and economic threats. We develop a systematic, quantitative prediction framework that combines formal modeling, discrete-event-based simulation, hierarchical modeling, and then use empirically calibrated sensitivity analysis to identify effective strategies. The framework offers flexibility for the modeling of a wide range of preservation policies and threats. Since this framework is open source and easily deployed in a cloud computing environment, it can be used to produce analysis based on independent estimates of scenario-specific costs, reliability, and risks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. Global-Local Path Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation with Vertical CutDepth\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical scale integration*\n\n*Woonghyun Ka, Junmo Kim, Sehwan Chun, Donggyu Joo, Pyungwhan Ahn, Doyeon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Depth estimation from a single image is an important task that can be applied to various fields in computer vision, and has grown rapidly with the development of convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel structure and training strategy for monocular depth estimation to further improve the prediction accuracy of the network. We deploy a hierarchical transformer encoder to capture and convey the global context, and design a lightweight yet powerful decoder to generate an estimated depth map while considering local connectivity. By constructing connected paths between multi-scale local features and the global decoding stream with our proposed selective feature fusion module, the network can integrate both representations and recover fine details. In addition, the proposed decoder shows better performance than the previously proposed decoders, with considerably less computational complexity. Furthermore, we improve the depth-specific augmentation method by utilizing an important observation in depth estimation to enhance the model. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance over the challenging depth dataset NYU Depth V2.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.

Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers multi-scale*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Its application to video generation is still facing many challenges: The potential huge computation cost makes the training from scratch unaffordable; The scarcity and weak relevance of text-video datasets hinder the model understanding complex movement semantics.

An Empirical Study on Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero-Shot Labels\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers multi-scale*\n\n*Ilias Chalkidis, Manos Fergadiotis, Sotiris Kotitsas, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Nikolaos Aletras, Ion Androutsopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains, and shows that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWans.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges. First, not all labels are well represented in the training set, due to the very large label set and the skewed label distributions of LMTC datasets. Also, label hierarchies and differences in human labelling guidelines may affect graph-aware annotation proximity. Finally, the label hierarchies are periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning, although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art method which combines BERT with LWANs. Finally, we propose new models that leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 76  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5.

The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

We study the behavior of entropies and mutual informations throughout learning and conclude that, in the proposed setting, the relationship between compression and generalization remains elusive.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 167  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7.

Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient feature integration*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result. Our study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 123  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. HiFormer: Hierarchical Multi-scale Representations Using Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers multi-scale*\n\n*Dorit Merhof, Julien Cohen-Adad, Ehsan Khodapanah Aghdam, Reza Azad, Milad Soltany, Amirhossein Kazerouni, Moein Heidari*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the consensus for medical image segmentation tasks. However, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependencies and spatial correlations due to the nature of convolution operation. Although transformers were first developed to address this issue, they fail to capture low-level features. In contrast, it is demonstrated that both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction, such as segmenting in challenging contexts. In this paper, we propose HiFormer, a novel method that efficiently bridges a CNN and a transformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design two multi-scale feature representations using the seminal Swin Transformer module and a CNN-based encoder. To secure a fine fusion of global and local features obtained from the two aforementioned representations, we propose a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module in the skip connection of the encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiFormer over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods in terms of computational complexity, and quantitative and qualitative results.

Multi-scale Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Cascaded Attention Decoding for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers multi-scale*\n\n*Radu Marculescu, Md Mostafijur Rahman*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great success in medical image segmentation. However, transformers may exhibit a limited generalization ability due to the underlying single-scale self-attention (SA) mechanism. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a Multi-scale hiERarchical vIsion Transformer (MERIT) backbone network, which improves the generalizability of the model by computing SA at multiple scales. We also incorporate an attention-based decoder, namely Cascaded Attention Decoding (CASCADE), for further refinement of multi-stage features generated by MERIT. Finally, we introduce an effective multi-stage feature mixing loss aggregation (MUTATION) method for better model training via implicit ensembling. Our experiments on two widely used medical image segmentation benchmarks (i.e., Synapse Multi-organ, ACDC) demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT over state-of-the-art methods. Our MERIT architecture and MUTATION loss aggregation can be used with downstream medical image and semantic segmentation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** multi-scale-hierarchical-vision-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. Cross-Batch Memory for Embedding Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient feature integration*\n\n*Weilin Huang, Haozhi Zhang, Xun Wang, Matthew R. Scott*\n\n**Abstract:** Mining informative negative instances are of central importance to deep metric learning (DML), however this task is intrinsically limited by mini-batch training, where only a mini-batch of instances is accessible at each iteration. In this paper, we identify a \"slow drift\" phenomena by observing that the embedding features drift exceptionally slow even as the model parameters are updating throughout the training process. This suggests that the features of instances computed at preceding iterations can be used to considerably approximate their features extracted by the current model. We propose a cross-batch memory (XBM) mechanism that memorizes the embeddings of past iterations, allowing the model to collect sufficient hard negative pairs across multiple mini-batches - even over the whole dataset. Our XBM can be directly integrated into a general pair-based DML framework, where the XBM augmented DML can boost performance considerably. In particular, without bells and whistles, a simple contrastive loss with our XBM can have large R@1 improvements of 12%-22.5% on three large-scale image retrieval datasets, surpassing the most sophisticated state-of-the-art methods, by a large margin. Our XBM is conceptually simple, easy to implement - using several lines of codes, and is memory efficient - with a negligible 0.2 GB extra GPU memory.

SCEdit: Efficient and Controllable Image Diffusion Generation via Skip Connection Editing\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient feature integration*\n\n*Jingfeng Zhang, Zhen Han, Yulin Pan, Chaojie Mao, Zeyinzi Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Image diffusion models have been utilized in various tasks, such as text-to-image generation and controllable image synthesis. Recent research has introduced tuning methods that make subtle adjustments to the original models, yielding promising results in specific adaptations of foundational generative diffusion models. Rather than modifying the main backbone of the diffusion model, we delve into the role of skip connection in U-Net and reveal that hierarchical features aggregating long-distance information across encoder and decoder make a significant impact on the content and quality of image generation. Based on the observation, we propose an efficient generative tuning framework, dubbed SCEdit, which integrates and edits Skip Connection using a lightweight tuning module named SC-Tuner. Furthermore, the proposed framework allows for straightforward extension to controllable image synthesis by injecting different conditions with Controllable SC-Tuner, simplifying and unifying the network design for multi-condition inputs. Our SCEdit substantially reduces training parameters, memory usage, and computational expense due to its lightweight tuners, with backward propagation only passing to the decoder blocks. Extensive experiments conducted on text-to-image generation and controllable image synthesis tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of efficiency and performance.

This hierarchical approach can be adapted to language models to handle sequences at multiple levels of granularity. For instance, the Swin Transformer's hierarchical design allows it to process data at varying scales, which could be beneficial for understanding both local and global contexts in language sequences.\n\n## Methods for Combining Compression with Scale-Aware Processing\n\n- Recent advances in compression techniques, such as LoMA (Lossless Compressed Memory Attention) and SpQR (Sparse-Quantized Representation), show promise in reducing memory and computational demands while maintaining performance. These methods can be integrated with hierarchical processing to ensure that the model can handle multi-scale features efficiently without significant performance degradation. For example, LoMA enables lossless compression of the KV cache, which can be crucial for scale-aware processing.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Approaches to Multi-Scale Feature Integration\n\n- Techniques like CORM (Cache Optimization with Recent Message) and dual chunk attention provide efficient ways to manage memory and extend context in language models. These methods can be combined with hierarchical feature processing to ensure that the model retains essential information at multiple scales without excessive memory usage. CORM, for instance, dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference, which can be adapted for multi-scale feature integration.\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques Considering Feature Importance\n\n- Adaptive compression strategies, such as those used in SpQR, identify and isolate outlier weights that cause large quantization errors. This approach can be extended to hierarchical transformers by dynamically adapting compression ratios based on the importance of features at different scales. This ensures that critical features are preserved while less important ones are compressed more aggressively.\n\n## Recent Advances in Hierarchical Feature Processing for Transformers\n\n- The concept of relative positional encoding and hierarchical approaches can be applied to language models to handle longer sequences and capture dependencies at multiple scales. This involves processing the input at multiple levels of granularity, similar to the Swin Transformer's approach in computer vision. Such hierarchical processing can enhance the model's ability to understand long-range dependencies and maintain performance on longer sequences.\n\n### Key References and Insights\n\n- **Hierarchical Design**: The Swin Transformer's hierarchical structure is a strong candidate for adaptation in language models, allowing for efficient computation and scalability by capturing multi-scale features.\n- **Compression and Memory Management**: Techniques like LoMA, SpQR, and CORM provide insights into how to combine compression with scale-aware processing and manage memory efficiently in hierarchical transformer architectures.\n- **Adaptive Strategies**: Adaptive compression and dynamic retention of essential information are crucial for maintaining performance while reducing computational and memory demands.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical processing, adaptive compression, and memory-efficient feature integration, thereby improving its performance, scalability, and efficiency.\n",

Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2204.02311, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DDM}^{+}\\right.$23] Mostafa Dehghani, Josip Djolonga, Basil Mustafa, Piotr Padlewski, Jonathan Heek, Justin Gilmer, Many Others, Xiaohua Zhai, Daniel Keysers, Jeremiah Harmsen, and Neil Houlsby.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

MVSFormer++: Revealing the Devil in Transformer's Details for Multi-View Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms transformers*\n\n*Chenjie Cao, Xinlin Ren, Yanwei Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have prominently featured transformer-based models with attention mechanisms. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. GeminiFusion: Efficient Pixel-wise Multimodal Fusion for Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms transformers*\n\n*Ding Jia, Jianyuan Guo, Kai Han, Han Wu, Chao Zhang, Chang Xu, Xinghao Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first critiques prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal features, and demonstrates exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms, while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-modal transformers have demonstrated superiority in various vision tasks by effectively integrating different modalities. This paper first critiques prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal features, and demonstrate exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms, while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer sequences. To surmount the computational challenges, we propose GeminiFusion, a pixel-wise fusion approach that capitalizes on aligned cross-modal representations. GeminiFusion elegantly combines intra-modal and inter-modal attentions, dynamically integrating complementary information across modalities. We employ a layer-adaptive noise to adaptively control their interplay on a per-layer basis, thereby achieving a harmonized fusion process. Notably, GeminiFusion maintains linear complexity with respect to the number of input tokens, ensuring this multimodal framework operates with efficiency comparable to unimodal networks. Comprehensive evaluations across multimodal image-to-image translation, 3D object detection and arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation tasks, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, event data, etc. demonstrate the superior performance of our GeminiFusion against leading-edge techniques.

One Meta-tuned Transformer is What You Need for Few-shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms transformers*\n\n*Xuehan Yang, Huaxiu Yao, Ying Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, is designed, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision transformers have revolutionized few-shot image classification, and it has been recently demonstrated that the previous common practice of meta-learning in synergy with these pre-trained transformers still holds significance. In this work, we design a new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance. Leveraging the intrinsical property of ViTs in handling local patch relationships, we propose Masked Sample Attention (MSA) to efficiently embed the sample relationships into the network, where an adaptive mask is attached for enhancing task-specific feature consistency and providing flexibility in switching between few-shot learning setups. To encapsulate task relationships while filtering out background noise, Patch-grained Task Attention (PTA) is designed to maintain a dynamic knowledge pool consolidating diverse patterns from historical tasks. MetaFormer demonstrates coherence and compatibility with off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers and shows significant improvements in both inductive and transductive few-shot learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 8 . 77% and 6 . 25% on 12 in-domain and 10 cross-domain datasets, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient feature integration*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result. Our study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 123  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 7. HRKD: Hierarchical Relational Knowledge Distillation for Cross-domain Language Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*Chenhe Dong, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen, Minghui Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** To enhance the model capability and transferability, the idea of meta-learning is leveraged and set up domain-relational graphs to capture the relational information across different domains, and to dynamically select the most representative prototypes for each domain, a hierarchical compare-aggregate mechanism to capture hierarchical relationships.\n\n**Abstract:** On many natural language processing tasks, large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown overwhelming performances compared with traditional neural network methods. Nevertheless, their huge model size and low inference speed have hindered the deployment on resource-limited devices in practice. In this paper, we target to compress PLMs with knowledge distillation, and propose a hierarchical relational knowledge distillation (HRKD) method to capture both hierarchical and domain relational information. Specifically, to enhance the model capability and transferability, we leverage the idea of meta-learning and set up domain-relational graphs to capture the relational information across different domains. And to dynamically select the most representative prototypes for each domain, we propose a hierarchical compare-aggregate mechanism to capture hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our HRKD method as well as its strong few-shot learning ability.

The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process.

To reduce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation prevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation tasks. We show that it significantly outperforms existing compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms transformers*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

ViTMatte: Boosting Image Matting with Pretrained Plain Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms transformers*\n\n*Baoyuan Wang, Shusheng Yang, Xinggang Wang, Jingfeng Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to their strong modeling capacity and large-scale pretraining. However, they have not yet conquered the problem of image matting. We hypothesize that image matting could also be boosted by ViTs and present a new efficient and robust ViT-based matting system, named ViTMatte. Our method utilizes (i) a hybrid attention mechanism combined with a convolution neck to help ViTs achieve an excellent performance-computation trade-off in matting tasks. (ii) Additionally, we introduce the detail capture module, which just consists of simple lightweight convolutions to complement the detailed information required by matting. To the best of our knowledge, ViTMatte is the first work to unleash the potential of ViT on image matting with concise adaptation. It inherits many superior properties from ViT to matting, including various pretraining strategies, concise architecture design, and flexible inference strategies. We evaluate ViTMatte on Composition-1k and Distinctions-646, the most commonly used benchmark for image matting, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms prior matting works by a large margin.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Cross-Batch Memory for Embedding Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient feature integration*\n\n*Weilin Huang, Haozhi Zhang, Xun Wang, Matthew R. Scott*\n\n**Abstract:** Mining informative negative instances are of central importance to deep metric learning (DML), however this task is intrinsically limited by mini-batch training, where only a mini-batch of instances is accessible at each iteration. In this paper, we identify a \"slow drift\" phenomena by observing that the embedding features drift exceptionally slow even as the model parameters are updating throughout the training process. This suggests that the features of instances computed at preceding iterations can be used to considerably approximate their features extracted by the current model. We propose a cross-batch memory (XBM) mechanism that memorizes the embeddings of past iterations, allowing the model to collect sufficient hard negative pairs across multiple mini-batches - even over the whole dataset. Our XBM can be directly integrated into a general pair-based DML framework, where the XBM augmented DML can boost performance considerably. In particular, without bells and whistles, a simple contrastive loss with our XBM can have large R@1 improvements of 12%-22.5% on three large-scale image retrieval datasets, surpassing the most sophisticated state-of-the-art methods, by a large margin. Our XBM is conceptually simple, easy to implement - using several lines of codes, and is memory efficient - with a negligible 0.2 GB extra GPU memory.

Rather than modifying the main backbone of the diffusion model, we delve into the role of skip connection in U-Net and reveal that hierarchical features aggregating long-distance information across encoder and decoder make a significant impact on the content and quality of image generation. Based on the observation, we propose an efficient generative tuning framework, dubbed SCEdit, which integrates and edits Skip Connection using a lightweight tuning module named SC-Tuner. Furthermore, the proposed framework allows for straightforward extension to controllable image synthesis by injecting different conditions with Controllable SC-Tuner, simplifying and unifying the network design for multi-condition inputs. Our SCEdit substantially reduces training parameters, memory usage, and computational expense due to its lightweight tuners, with backward propagation only passing to the decoder blocks. Extensive experiments conducted on text-to-image generation and controllable image synthesis tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of efficiency and performance.

Simple and Controllable Music Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*Alexandre D\u00e9fossez, Yossi Adi, Gabriel Synnaeve, David Kant, Tal Remez, Itai Gat, Felix Kreuk, Jade Copet*\n\n**Abstract:** We tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, both mono and stereo, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen. Music samples, code, and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 6. Discrete Autoencoders for Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical compression language models*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks,\nespecially for language modeling and machine translation. Nevertheless, it\nremains challenging to extract good representations from these models. For\ninstance, even though language has a clear hierarchical structure going from\ncharacters through words to sentences, it is not apparent in current language\nmodels. We propose to improve the representation in sequence models by\naugmenting current approaches with an autoencoder that is forced to compress\nthe sequence through an intermediate discrete latent space. In order to\npropagate gradients though this discrete representation we introduce an\nimproved semantic hashing technique. We show that this technique performs well\non a newly proposed quantitative efficiency measure. We also analyze latent\ncodes produced by the model showing how they correspond to words and phrases.\nFinally, we present an application of the autoencoder-augmented model to\ngenerating diverse translations.\n\n**Conference:** discrete-autoencoders-for-sequence-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on adaptive attention mechanisms, memory-efficient feature integration, and hierarchical compression strategies, here are some key findings and relevant papers from 2022-2024:\n\n## Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of **dual reasoning modes** in the \"Dualformer\" model is noteworthy. This model integrates both fast and slow reasoning modes, similar to human cognition's System 1 and System 2. The slow mode, which involves more deliberative reasoning, can enhance the model's accuracy and optimality, although at a higher computational cost. This dual approach can be adapted to improve attention mechanisms in autoregressive models.\n\n- The \"System 2 Attention (S2A)\" mechanism proposed by Weston and Sukhbaatar aims to reduce the susceptibility of large language models to spurious correlations, thereby improving reasoning capabilities. This more deliberate attention mechanism can be integrated into autoregressive models to enhance their performance.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Feature Integration\n\n- **Dynamic Context Pruning** is a technique that can effectively prune up to 80% of the context without significant performance degradation. This method can be used to mitigate inference costs and improve memory efficiency in autoregressive models. It involves pruning the context based on its importance, which can be adapted to feature integration[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Cross-batch memory mechanisms** are mentioned in the analysis note as promising for efficient feature integration. These mechanisms allow for the sharing of information across different batches, which can be particularly useful in reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Strategies\n\n- **Hierarchical transformer architectures** like the Swin Transformer have shown success in handling multi-scale features efficiently. These architectures can be combined with compression techniques to achieve better memory efficiency. For example, hierarchical compression can be applied at different scales of the transformer architecture to reduce memory usage while preserving performance[Analysis Note].\n\n- **MEGALODON** introduces several technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA) and normalized attention mechanisms. These components can be adapted to implement hierarchical compression strategies, ensuring that the model maintains performance while reducing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n## Implementation Details and Empirical Results\n\n- The **Long-Short Transformer** aggregates long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. This approach can be used to implement multi-scale feature processing efficiently, which is crucial for balancing compression and model performance[Analysis Note].\n\n- **PanGu-\u03c0** enhances language model architectures via nonlinearity compensation, which can be integrated with hierarchical compression and adaptive attention mechanisms to improve overall performance. This model demonstrates how careful design of feature integration and compression can lead to better efficiency and performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Balancing Compression and Model Performance\n\n- The **Dynamic Context Pruning** technique provides a valuable tool for balancing compression ratio with model performance. By pruning the context based on its importance, the model can reduce memory requirements without significant performance degradation[Analysis Note].\n\n- The use of **hierarchical structures** in transformer architectures can help manage computational complexity and balance compression with performance. These structures enable efficient memory utilization and can be combined with adaptive compression techniques to achieve optimal results[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, integrating adaptive attention mechanisms like those in Dualformer and S2A, employing memory-efficient feature integration techniques such as cross-batch memory mechanisms and dynamic context pruning, and utilizing hierarchical compression strategies as seen in Swin Transformer and MEGALODON can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models. These approaches can help balance compression and model performance, ensuring efficient and high-performing models.\n",
