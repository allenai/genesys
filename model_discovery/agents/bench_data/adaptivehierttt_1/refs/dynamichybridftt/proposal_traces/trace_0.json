Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 5. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient attention mechanisms language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms language models*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms language models*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Pit One Against Many: Leveraging Attention-head Embeddings for Parameter-efficient Multi-head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms language models*\n\n*Huiyin Xue, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head, and empirically demonstrates that this MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling pre-trained language models has resulted in large performance gains in various natural language processing tasks but comes with a large cost in memory requirements. Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DiJiang: Efficient Large Language Models through Compact Kernelization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms language models*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Yuchuan Tian, Xutao Wang, Zhicheng Liu, Hanting Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** In an effort to reduce the computational load of Transformers, research on linear attention has gained significant momentum. However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms language models*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Xiaodong Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Pengcheng He*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably, we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) for the first time in terms of macro-average score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as of January 6, 2021, out performing the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus 89.8).\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on efficient attention mechanisms is crucial. Here are some recent developments and techniques that can help address the challenges of computational complexity, memory efficiency, and performance:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Hierarchical Attention\nHierarchical attention mechanisms, such as those used in the H-Transformer-1D, offer significant improvements in efficiency. This approach exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix), resulting in linear runtime and memory complexity. This is particularly effective for processing long sequences and has shown superior performance on benchmarks like the Long Range Arena[3,.\n\n### Block-Recurrent Transformers\nBlock-Recurrent Transformers apply transformer layers in a recurrent fashion, operating on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens. This approach maintains the computational cost and parameter count of conventional transformer layers while improving efficiency by processing blocks of tokens. This method can be integrated into a novel LM block design to enhance efficiency without compromising performance[3,.\n\n### Sparse Attention\nSparse attention mechanisms reduce the computational complexity by focusing only on a subset of the input sequence. Techniques like local attention or window attention can be used, where only a specific window or subset of the input sequence is considered, making it more computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications.\n\n### Linear Attention\nLinear attention mechanisms simplify the self-attention process by avoiding the need for computing the dot product of query and key matrices, which can be computationally expensive. Instead, linear attention uses kernel functions to approximate the attention weights, reducing the computational complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\).\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\n\n### Streaming Attention\nFor long sequences, streaming attention mechanisms can be employed. The concept of \"attention sinks\" introduced in StreamingLLM allows large language models to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without extensive memory consumption. This involves caching the Key and Value states (KV) of initial tokens, which acts as an \"attention sink\" and helps recover performance even when the text length surpasses the cache size.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nBlock-based processing, as seen in Block-Recurrent Transformers, helps in managing memory more efficiently. By operating on blocks of tokens, these models can reduce the memory footprint compared to processing individual tokens, which is beneficial for handling long sequences[3,.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimizations\n\n### Parallelization\nSelf-attention mechanisms in transformer models allow for parallel processing of input sequences, which significantly speeds up training times. This parallelization is particularly beneficial when using feedforward networks instead of recurrent networks, as it leverages GPU acceleration more effectively.\n\n### Modular Design\nA modular design approach can help in integrating different architectural components efficiently. This includes combining block-recurrent processing with hierarchical attention and state space models to capture different levels of dependencies while optimizing for hardware constraints[3,.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures\n\n### Combining Different Architectures\nHybrid models, such as the MambaFormer, combine different architectures (e.g., Mamba with attention blocks) to leverage their complementary strengths. This approach can enhance performance in tasks where individual models struggle independently[4,.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can design novel autoregressive language model blocks that are more efficient, scalable, and performant:\n\n- **Hierarchical and block-recurrent attention** for efficient sequence processing and reduced computational complexity.\n- **Sparse and linear attention** to optimize computational resources.\n- **Streaming attention** and **block-based processing** to manage memory efficiently for long sequences.\n- **Parallelization** and **hardware-aware optimizations** to leverage GPU acceleration and reduce training times.\n- **Hybrid architectures** to combine the strengths of different models and enhance overall performance.\n\nThese approaches can help in creating a more efficient, scalable, and high-performing autoregressive language model.\n",

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset.

We evaluate its performance on the PG19, Proof-pile, and LongBench datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-04.jpg?height=375&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Segmentation and Reassembly process in SF-Attn. The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs. A cost-effective method for KV cache compression is token dropping [25, 43, 16], which establishes an importance policy to retain significant KVs and remove insignificant ones.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (Avg.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, S. Savarese, Steven C. H. Hoi*\n\n**TL;DR:** BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods, and is demonstrated's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2890  (*Influential: 536*)\n\n#### 5.

However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension.

QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Ari Holtzman, Artidoro Pagnoni, Tim Dettmers*\n\n**Abstract:** We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. S-LoRA: Serving Thousands of Concurrent LoRA Adapters\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Kurt Keutzer, Lianmin Zheng, Banghua Zhu, Christopher Chou, Shuo Yang, Nicholas Lee, Coleman Hooper, Dacheng Li, Shiyi Cao, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"pretrain-then-finetune\" paradigm is commonly adopted in the deployment of large language models. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is often employed to adapt a base model to a multitude of tasks, resulting in a substantial collection of LoRA adapters derived from one base model. We observe that this paradigm presents significant opportunities for batched inference during serving. To capitalize on these opportunities, we present S-LoRA, a system designed for the scalable serving of many LoRA adapters. S-LoRA stores all adapters in the main memory and fetches the adapters used by the currently running queries to the GPU memory. To efficiently use the GPU memory and reduce fragmentation, S-LoRA proposes Unified Paging. Unified Paging uses a unified memory pool to manage dynamic adapter weights with different ranks and KV cache tensors with varying sequence lengths. Additionally, S-LoRA employs a novel tensor parallelism strategy and highly optimized custom CUDA kernels for heterogeneous batching of LoRA computation. Collectively, these features enable S-LoRA to serve thousands of LoRA adapters on a single GPU or across multiple GPUs with a small overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art libraries such as HuggingFace PEFT and vLLM (with naive support of LoRA serving), S-LoRA can improve the throughput by up to 4 times and increase the number of served adapters by several orders of magnitude. As a result, S-LoRA enables scalable serving of many task-specific fine-tuned models and offers the potential for large-scale customized fine-tuning services.

SMT-Friendly Formalization of the Solidity Memory Model\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state management language models*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Solidity is the dominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.\nThis paper presents a high-level formalization of the Solidity language with a\nfocus on the memory model. The presented formalization covers all features of\nthe language related to managing state and memory. In addition, the\nformalization we provide is effective: all but few features can be encoded in\nthe quantifier-free fragment of standard SMT theories. This enables precise and\nefficient reasoning about the state of smart contracts written in Solidity. The\nformalization is implemented in the solc-verify verifier and we provide an\nextensive set of tests that covers the breadth of the required semantics. We\nalso provide an evaluation on the test set that validates the semantics and\nshows the novelty of the approach compared to other Solidity-level contract\nanalysis tools.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on memory-efficient state management, several techniques and approaches can be considered based on the provided sources and analysis.\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Management\n\n### Adaptive Compression and State Updates\n- Techniques like **gradient low-rank projection (GaLore)** can be highly effective. GaLore exploits the low-rank structure of gradients to reduce the memory footprint during training, allowing for full-parameter learning while preserving model capacity and performance.\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), can significantly reduce memory requirements by parametrizing a weight matrix with low-rank adapters. This approach adapts pre-trained models to various downstream tasks without fine-tuning all model parameters, thus reducing computational and memory overhead.\n\n### Caching Strategies\n- **Pensieve's multi-tier caching strategy** can be integrated to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. This system maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history, avoiding duplicate processing and reducing memory usage. It utilizes both GPU and CPU memory to store and retrieve cached data, which can be particularly beneficial for multi-turn conversations.\n\n### Selective State Updates\n- **Writing memories in the background** can help in managing state updates efficiently. This approach separates the application logic from the memory logic, allowing the model to focus on immediate tasks without the overhead of real-time memory management. It involves updating memory as a separate task, which can be scheduled or triggered manually, reducing latency and improving modularity.\n\n### Hierarchical and Block-Based Processing\n- **Hierarchical approaches** and **block-based processing** can be used to handle long sequences efficiently. These methods involve tiling and block-wise computation strategies, which are effective for hardware optimization and reducing memory usage. Separating intra-block and inter-block computations enables efficient parallel processing and better hardware utilization[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization\n\n### Memory Offloading and Sharding\n- **Memory offloading strategies**, such as those implemented in ZeRO-Offload, can move optimizer states and gradients to CPU memory when not actively in use, freeing up GPU memory. Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) extends this concept by sharding model parameters, optimizer states, and gradients across DDP processes, significantly reducing the memory footprint.\n\n### IO-Aware Implementations\n- **IO-aware attention implementations** are crucial for practical efficiency gains. These implementations optimize memory access patterns, which significantly impact performance. Techniques like Lightning Attention-2, which leverage tiling and separate handling of intra-block and inter-block components, can retain consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n\n## Integration Approaches\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\n- **Hybrid attention mechanisms** can combine the benefits of different attention types. For example, integrating linear attention mechanisms like Luna's nested linear attention functions with latent attention mechanisms can offer a balance between efficiency and expressiveness. These hybrid approaches can be designed to reduce complexity while maintaining performance[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop an enhanced autoregressive language model block that is memory-efficient, scalable, and maintains high performance:\n\n- Use adaptive compression and low-rank projection methods to reduce memory footprint.\n- Implement multi-tier caching strategies to manage state efficiently.\n- Employ block-based processing and hierarchical approaches for handling long sequences.\n- Optimize memory usage through memory offloading and sharding techniques.\n- Utilize IO-aware implementations and hybrid attention mechanisms to balance efficiency and performance.\n\nThese strategies can help in achieving the goal of improving autoregressive language model design with a focus on memory efficiency, scalability, and overall performance.\n",

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/36 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\n# Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms \n\nAndr\u00e9 F.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Fine- and Coarse-Granularity Hybrid Self-Attention for Efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Jing Zhao, Yifan Wang, Junwei Bao, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** FC is proposed, a fine- and coarse-granularity hybrid self-attention that reduces the computation cost through progressively shortening the computational sequence length in self-Attention and offers a significantly better trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs compared to prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based pre-trained models, such as BERT, have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, deploying these models can be prohibitively costly, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer suffers from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length. To confront this, we propose FCA, a fine- and coarse-granularity hybrid self-attention that reduces the computation cost through progressively shortening the computational sequence length in self-attention. Specifically, FCA conducts an attention-based scoring strategy to determine the informativeness of tokens at each layer. Then, the informative tokens serve as the fine-granularity computing units in self-attention and the uninformative tokens are replaced with one or several clusters as the coarse-granularity computing units in self-attention. Experiments on the standard GLUE benchmark show that BERT with FCA achieves 2x reduction in FLOPs over original BERT with <1% loss in accuracy. We show that FCA offers a significantly better trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Understanding the Role of Self Attention for Efficient Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Wonyong Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is discovered that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved and implemented the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieves noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention (SA) is a critical component of Transformer neural networks that have succeeded in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we analyze the role of SA in Transformer-based ASR models for not only understanding the mechanism of improved recognition accuracy but also lowering the computational complexity. We reveal that SA performs two distinct roles: phonetic and linguistic localization. Especially, we show by experiments that phonetic localization in the lower layers extracts phonologically meaningful features from speech and reduces the phonetic variance in the utterance for proper linguistic localization in the upper layers. From this understanding, we discover that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved. To evaluate this idea, we implement the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieve up to 1.96 times speedup in inference and 33% savings in training time with noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Gated Convolutional Networks with Hybrid Connectivity for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Yongjun Xu, Hui Zhu, Zhulin An, Kaiqiang Xu, Kun Zhang, Chao Li, Xiaolong Hu, Chuanguang Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple yet effective method to reduce the redundancy of DenseNet by substantially decreasing the number of stacked modules by replacing the original bottleneck by our SMG module, which is augmented by local residual. Furthermore, SMG module is equipped with an efficient two-stage pipeline, which aims to DenseNet-like architectures that need to integrate all previous outputs, i.e., squeezing the incoming informative but redundant features gradually by hierarchical convolutions as a hourglass shape and then exciting it by multi-kernel depthwise convolutions, the output of which would be compact and hold more informative multi-scale features. We further develop a forget and an update gate by introducing the popular attention modules to implement the effective fusion instead of a simple addition between reused and new features. Due to the Hybrid Connectivity (nested combination of global dense and local residual) and Gated mechanisms, we called our network as the HCGNet. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show that HCGNet is more prominently efficient than DenseNet, and can also significantly outperform state-of-the-art networks with less complexity. Moreover, HCGNet also shows the remarkable interpretability and robustness by network dissection and adversarial defense, respectively. On MS-COCO, HCGNet can consistently learn better features than popular backbones.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Masked Mixers for Language Generation and Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanisms efficient implementation*\n\n*Benjamin L. Badger*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most information present in the input is necessarily lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers, but find more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. Applied to TinyStories the masked mixer learns causal language tasks more efficiently than early transformer implementations and somewhat less efficiently than optimized, current implementations. The most efficient learning algorithm observed for this dataset is a transformer-masked mixer hybrid, suggesting that these models learn in an orthogonal manner. We hypothesized that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be much more detrimental to retrieval than generation, and to test this we introduce an efficient training approach for retrieval models based on existing generative model embeddings. With this method, embeddings from masked mixers are found to result in far better summary-to-story retrieval compared to embeddings from transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by incorporating hybrid attention mechanisms and efficient implementation strategies, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Combining Different Types of Attention\n- The concept of hybrid attention mechanisms involves combining multiple types of attention to leverage their strengths.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nWe use superscripts, e.g. . ${ }^{d}$, to denote the elements or block-elements of a matrix and a block-matrix. We use subscripts, e.g. ${ }_{i}$, to denote the time index (or input dependency). Specifically, $v_{i}$ represents the value of vector $v$ at time $i$. We use bold notation to indicate sequences, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_{i}=\\left[v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{i}\\right]$. We use $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ to denote is the sigmoid function. The products $\\odot$ and $\\otimes$ denote the Hadamard (element-wise) product and the Kronecker (block-wise) product, respectively. $\\mathbb{I}_{n}$ denotes the identity matrix of size $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. Generally, we omit stating the bias term for weight matrices unless stating the bias term helps with clarity. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we introduce the key architectural components studied in this work: attention, SSMs, and RNNs. We remark that these components are often the central block - considered to be the backbone - within a complex architecture composed of other blocks and skip connections (see for instance Touvron et al., 2023]). In what follows, we review exclusively the backbone block, which\nwe denote as $f(\\cdot)$ in $\\mathbf{y}=f(\\mathbf{u})$, where $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ and $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ are the input and output sequences, respectively. ### 2.1 Attention\n\nThe standard self-attention block [Vaswani et al. 2017] consists of three matrices: $W_{Q}, W_{K}$, and $W_{V}$, which are the learnt parameters of the model. These matrices, when multiplied with the input $\\mathbf{u}$, yield the queries $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}$, keys $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}$, and values $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}}$, respectively:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{u} W_{Q}, \\quad \\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{u} W_{K}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u} W_{V}\n$$\n\nKeys, queries, and values are then combined in the attention block to produce the output\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}=\\zeta\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q} \\mathbf{k}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\zeta(\\cdot)$ is a map $\\mathbb{R}^{L} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ and is applied row-wise. In the standard version of attention - softmax attention $-\\zeta(\\cdot):=\\operatorname{softmax}(\\cdot)$. However, given the limitations of the softmax function, alternative formulations have been proposed. In this work, we consider two formulations of attention: softmax attention (2) and linear attention [Katharopoulos et al. 2020]. We focus on the masked attention formulations, i.e., the attention matrix $\\zeta\\left(\\mathbf{q k}^{\\top}\\right)$ has a lower-triangular structure. Furthermore, in order to simplify the derivations, we drop the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_{k}}$. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nArchitectures based on a state space parametrization compute the output y through a dynamic recurrence of input signals at each time step $i$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_{i} & =A_{i} h_{i-1}+B_{i} u_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =C_{i} h_{i}+D_{i} u_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{i}$ is the hidden state of the system, and the dynamic matrices of appropriate dimensions $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$ are the learnt parameters of the model. Different time-varying and time-invariant parameterizations for $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$ have been proposed in the literature (an overview is given in (Amo Alonso et al., 2024]).\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.56)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 4.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. NASViT: Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Vision Transformers with Gradient Conflict aware Supernet Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Chengyue Gong, Dilin Wang, Meng Li, Xinlei Chen, Zhicheng Yan, Yuandong Tian, Qiang Liu, Vikas Chandra*\n\n**TL;DR:** A discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing accurate and ef\ufb01cient vision transformers (ViTs) is an important but challenging task. Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks. Our discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.

Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, A. Gholami, Albert Eaton Shaw, Nicholas Lee, K. Mangalam, J. Malik, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Squeezeformer is proposed which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes and incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal.\n\n**Abstract:** The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs.

Efficient Modulation for Vision Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Xu Ma, Xiyang Dai, Jianwei Yang, Bin Xiao, Yinpeng Chen, Yun Fu, Lu Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work revisits the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block, and proposes the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for networks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present efficient modulation, a novel design for efficient vision networks. We revisit the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block. We demonstrate that the modulation mechanism is particularly well suited for efficient networks and further tailor the modulation design by proposing the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for our networks. Benefiting from the prominent representational ability of modulation mechanism and the proposed efficient design, our network can accomplish better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency and set new state-of-the-art performance in the zoo of efficient networks. When integrating EfficientMod with the vanilla self-attention block, we obtain the hybrid architecture which further improves the performance without loss of efficiency. We carry out comprehensive experiments to verify EfficientMod's performance. With fewer parameters, our EfficientMod-s performs 0.6 top-1 accuracy better than EfficientFormerV2-s2 and is 25% faster on GPU, and 2.9 better than MobileViTv2-1.0 at the same GPU latency.

Multi-GPU-Enabled Hybrid Quantum-Classical Workflow in Quantum-HPC Middleware: Applications in Quantum Simulations\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state transitions hybrid architectures*\n\n*Chen-Yu Liu, Yun-Yuan Wang, Xiaotian Xu, Xiaoren Li, Kuan-Cheng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware. For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation. The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on efficient state transitions in hybrid neural architectures, here are some key techniques and approaches that can be considered:\n\n## Hybrid Architecture Innovations\n\n### Combining Different Attention Mechanisms\n- The concept of combining self-attention and other attention mechanisms, such as additive attention, is promising.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

The figure compares two pooling strategies, Top- $P_{s}$ (ours) and Top- $K \\%$.

Results are for Mamba-130m. Layer 17\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-12.jpg?height=463&width=758&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=1050)\n\nFigure 12: Pooling Strategy Ablation. Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively. As can be seen from the two cases examined above, the $\\Delta_{t}$ activation captures the needle location successfully, demonstrating the effectiveness of its 'importance scoring' mechanism. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=644&width=1604&top_left_y=1637&top_left_x=226)\n\nFigure 14: Measuring the Effects of Limited ERFs.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Cascaded Head-colliding Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\" \"Hierarchical Transformer\" \"Dual-Stream Processing\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Zhiyong Wu, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) on\na variety of important tasks. At the cornerstone of the Transformer\narchitecture is the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism which models pairwise\ninteractions between the elements of the sequence. Despite its massive success,\nthe current framework ignores interactions among different heads, leading to\nthe problem that many of the heads are redundant in practice, which greatly\nwastes the capacity of the model. To improve parameter efficiency, we\nre-formulate the MHA as a latent variable model from a probabilistic\nperspective. We present cascaded head-colliding attention (CODA) which\nexplicitly models the interactions between attention heads through a\nhierarchical variational distribution. We conduct extensive experiments and\ndemonstrate that CODA outperforms the transformer baseline, by $0.6$ perplexity\non \\texttt{Wikitext-103} in language modeling, and by $0.6$ BLEU on\n\\texttt{WMT14 EN-DE} in machine translation, due to its improvements on the\nparameter efficiency.\\footnote{Our implementation is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/LZhengisme/CODA}.}\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-31T10:06:42Z  (*Updated: 2021-05-31T10:06:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Recognizing Long Grammatical Sequences Using Recurrent Networks\n  Augmented With An External Differentiable Stack\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\" \"Hierarchical Transformer\" \"Dual-Stream Processing\"*\n\n*Ankur Mali, Alexander Ororbia, Daniel Kifer, Clyde Lee Giles*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a widely used deep architecture for\nsequence modeling, generation, and prediction. Despite success in applications\nsuch as machine translation and voice recognition, these stateful models have\nseveral critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly over very\nlong sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal\nprocessing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in\nrecognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy\non training. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an\nexternal, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However,\ndifferentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on\nCFLs nor tested on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few\nefforts that have studied them have shown that continuous differentiable memory\nstructures yield poor generalization for complex CFLs, making the RNN less\ninterpretable. In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with\nimportant architectural and state updating mechanisms that ensure that the\nmodel learns to properly balance the use of its latent states with external\nmemory. Our improved RNN models exhibit better generalization performance and\nare able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context\nfree grammars (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CGGs, including the Dyck\nlanguages, as well as on the Penn Treebank language modelling task, and achieve\nstable, robust performance across these benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that\nonly our memory-augmented networks are capable of retaining memory for a longer\nduration up to strings of length 160.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-04T14:19:15Z  (*Updated: 2020-04-22T15:36:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We reparameterize\nthe model's discrete variables with auxiliary continuous latent variables and a\nlight-weight hierarchical structure. Our model is learned to minimize the\nmutual information between the observed data and optional side knowledge that\nis not already captured by the new, auxiliary variables. We theoretically show\nthat our approach generalizes past approaches, and perform an empirical case\nstudy of our approach on event modeling. We corroborate our theoretical results\nwith strong empirical experiments, showing that the proposed method outperforms\nprevious proposed approaches on multiple datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24T17:54:59Z  (*Updated: 2023-02-14T18:58:14Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that need to be investigated further:\n\n### Novelty of Hierarchical Processing in GAUs\n\n1. **Existing Hierarchical Models:**\n   - Review recent papers on hierarchical transformers and multi-scale processing models, such as the Hi-Transformer proposed by Wu et al.

(1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2. Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Chau, Nikhil Rao, Benjamin Van Durme*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We\npropose Dodo, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per\ntoken in a standard transformer model, Dodo represents text with a dynamic\nnumber of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a\nfraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as\nLLaMA can be adapted to Dodo by efficient parameter tuning methods such as\nLoRA. In use, Dodo can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context\ncompressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language\nmodeling, question answering, and summarization that Dodo retains capabilities\nin these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For\nexample, in the autoencoding task, Dodo shrinks context at a 20x compression\nratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless\nencoding.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T20:07:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-13T15:19:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical GAUs\" \"Dual-Stream Autoregressive Models\" \"Adaptive State Compression Transformers\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and areas of focus that need to be addressed:\n\n### Key Objectives\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Improve the model's ability to process long sequences efficiently.\n- **Expressiveness and Adaptability**: Maintain or enhance the model's expressiveness and adaptability during test-time training.\n- **Low Perplexity and High Accuracy**: Achieve low perplexity on language corpora and high accuracy on downstream tasks.\n- **Robustness**: Ensure robustness to varied inputs.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Optimize the model for efficient training and inference on modern hardware.\n\n### Proposed Design: HierarchicalFastTTTLinear\n- **Dual-Stream Architecture**: Integrate a dual-stream architecture with fast and slow processing streams, similar to the \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\" by Didolkar et al.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2. Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.07)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Score: 0.04)\n\n*Itamar Zimerman, Ameen Ali, Lior Wolf*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A unified view of attention-free layers of Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs is presented, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers and providing a direct means for applying explainability methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient sequence modeling have led to attention-free layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, all featuring sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length and excellent scaling properties, enabling the construction of a new type of foundation models. In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04081, 2024.

Shared Latent Space by Both Languages in Non-Autoregressive Neural\n  Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical FastTTTLinear GAUs\" \"Adaptive Compression in Autoregressive Models\" \"Dual-Stream State Space Models\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) offers substantial\ntranslation speed up compared to autoregressive neural machine translation (AT)\nat the cost of translation quality. Latent variable modeling has emerged as a\npromising approach to bridge this quality gap, particularly for addressing the\nchronic multimodality problem in NAT. In the previous works that used latent\nvariable modeling, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior\ndistribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target\nsentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant\ninformation extraction in the latent variable, increasing the number of\nparameters, and a tendency to ignore some information from the inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel latent variable modeling that integrates a dual\nreconstruction perspective and an advanced hierarchical latent modeling with a\nshared intermediate latent space across languages. This latent variable\nmodeling hypothetically alleviates or prevents the above disadvantages. In our\nexperiment results, we present comprehensive demonstrations that our proposed\napproach infers superior latent variables which lead better translation\nquality. Finally, in the benchmark translation tasks, such as WMT, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves translation quality\ncompared to previous NAT baselines including the state-of-the-art NAT model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02T15:33:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-09T01:44:27Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical FastTTTLinear GAUs\" \"Adaptive Compression in Autoregressive Models\" \"Dual-Stream State Space Models\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation with Latent Alignments\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical FastTTTLinear GAUs\" \"Adaptive Compression in Autoregressive Models\" \"Dual-Stream State Space Models\"*\n\n*Chitwan Saharia, William Chan, Saurabh Saxena, Mohammad Norouzi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents two strong methods, CTC and Imputer, for\nnon-autoregressive machine translation that model latent alignments with\ndynamic programming. We revisit CTC for machine translation and demonstrate\nthat a simple CTC model can achieve state-of-the-art for single-step\nnon-autoregressive machine translation, contrary to what prior work indicates.\nIn addition, we adapt the Imputer model for non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation and demonstrate that Imputer with just 4 generation steps can match\nthe performance of an autoregressive Transformer baseline. Our latent alignment\nmodels are simpler than many existing non-autoregressive translation baselines;\nfor example, we do not require target length prediction or re-scoring with an\nautoregressive model. On the competitive WMT'14 En$\\rightarrow$De task, our CTC\nmodel achieves 25.7 BLEU with a single generation step, while Imputer achieves\n27.5 BLEU with 2 generation steps, and 28.0 BLEU with 4 generation steps. This\ncompares favourably to the autoregressive Transformer baseline at 27.8 BLEU.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-16T03:45:56Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-16T13:08:49Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the \"HierarchicalFastTTTLinear\" GAU, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Dual-Stream Architectures\n\n- The proposal aims to integrate hierarchical multi-scale processing and dual-stream architectures (fast and slow streams) within GAUs.
