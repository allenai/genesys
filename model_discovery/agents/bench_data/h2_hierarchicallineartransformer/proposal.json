However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Rares Dolga, Marius Cobzarenco, David Barber*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A method to reduce the time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors is introduced, which allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer scales quadratically with the length of the sequence. We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/63 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMath. Syst.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Lingkai Kong, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, is proposed, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback, and develops a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the potential in acting as autonomous agents for sequential decision-making tasks. However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 4.

With advancements in technologies such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL), the prompts fed to LLMs are becoming increasingly lengthy, even exceeding tens of thousands of tokens. To accelerate model inference and reduce cost, this paper presents LLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method that involves a budget controller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, a token-level iterative compression algorithm to better model the interdependence between compressed contents, and an instruction tuning based method for distribution alignment between language models.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.

Image and Video Tokenization with Binary Spherical Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Yuanjun Xiong, Yue Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new transformer-based image and video tokenizer with Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ). BSQ projects the high-dimensional visual embedding to a lower-dimensional hypersphere and then applies binary quantization. BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. ERNIE-Tiny : A Progressive Distillation Framework for Pretrained Transformer Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, Hua Wu, Hao Tian, Yu Sun, Weixin Liu, Jiaxiang Liu, Shikun Feng, Xuyi Chen, Weiyue Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT adopt a training paradigm which first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on task-specific data, and have recently achieved great success. However, PLMs are notorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life applications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this problem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller student over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key components, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial to the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage progressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the three components gradually from general level to task-specific level. Specifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with guidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss. Then, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained teacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts training data from general data to task-specific data. In the end, Task-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and Hard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In particular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over 98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of parameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five Chinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer parameters and9.4x faster inference speed.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mini-Monkey: Alleviating the Semantic Sawtooth Effect for Lightweight MLLMs via Complementary Image Pyramid\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression language models*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Lianwen Jin, Dingkang Liang, Yuliang Liu, Mingxin Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, scaling images to high resolution has received much attention in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Most existing practices adopt a sliding-window-style cropping strategy to adapt to resolution increase. Such a cropping strategy, however, can easily cut off objects and connected regions, which introduces semantic discontinuity and therefore impedes MLLMs from recognizing small or irregularly shaped objects or text, leading to a phenomenon we call the semantic sawtooth effect. This effect is particularly evident in lightweight MLLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a Complementary Image Pyramid (CIP), a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution designed to mitigate semantic discontinuity during high-resolution image processing. In particular, CIP dynamically constructs an image pyramid to provide complementary semantic information for the cropping-based MLLMs, enabling them to richly acquire semantics at all levels. Furthermore, we introduce a Scale Compression Mechanism (SCM) to reduce the additional computational overhead by compressing the redundant visual tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that CIP can consistently enhance the performance across diverse architectures (e.g., MiniCPM-V-2, InternVL2, and LLaVA-OneVision), various model capacity (1B$\\rightarrow$8B), and different usage configurations (training-free and fine-tuning). Leveraging the proposed CIP and SCM, we introduce a lightweight MLLM, Mini-Monkey, which achieves remarkable performance in both general multimodal understanding and document understanding. On the OCRBench, the 2B-version Mini-Monkey even surpasses the 8B model InternVL2-8B by 12 score. Additionally, training Mini-Monkey is cheap, requiring only eight RTX 3090 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/Monkey.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on combining state-space models with attention mechanisms for efficiency and scalability, here are some key insights and relevant techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Adaptive State Compression\n- The concept of adaptive state compression is crucial for reducing memory footprint and improving efficiency. A paper on \"Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\" discusses a plug-and-play method to reduce the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) by compressing the key-value (KV) cache. This approach can be integrated with state-space models to maintain critical information while compressing less important states.\n\n## State-Space Models Integration\n- The idea of using state-space models (SSMs) with transfer functions, as mentioned in the analysis, shows promise for state-free inference. This approach can be combined with attention mechanisms to leverage the efficiency of state-free processing while selectively maintaining critical state information. The RTF paper's method of using transfer functions for sequence parallel inference could be adapted to work with hierarchical attention mechanisms, enhancing both efficiency and scalability[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Attention Mechanisms\n- Hierarchical multi-scale approaches, such as the one described in the meta_hierarchical_linear_transfo design, can be enhanced by integrating state-space models. This integration can allow for dynamic scale adaptation and content-dependent hierarchy adjustment. For example, using multiple attention heads with different scales, as seen in models like GPT-2, can be combined with state-space models to handle long sequences more efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Management and Compressed State Representation\n- Neurocache's approach to storing compressed states and performing single retrieval operations per token can be integrated with hierarchical processing and state-space models. This would allow for efficient retrieval mechanisms and a balance between memory and computation, which is essential for scalable LLMs[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Implementations\n- Techniques like those described in ALISE, which involve speculative scheduling and adaptive memory management, can be applied to optimize the inference serving of LLMs. By estimating execution times and prioritizing jobs, ALISE improves throughput and reduces latency, which can be beneficial when integrating state-space models and attention mechanisms.\n\n### Future Directions\n\n- **Combining State-Space Models with Attention**: Investigate how state-space models can be integrated with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve state-free or selective state maintenance. This could involve using transfer functions for efficient sequence processing and adapting attention heads to handle different scales dynamically.\n- **Adaptive Compression and Memory Management**: Implement adaptive KV cache compression and other memory management techniques to reduce the memory footprint while preserving performance. This can be done by selectively compressing states and using efficient retrieval mechanisms.\n- **Hierarchical Processing Enhancements**: Explore dynamic scale adaptation and content-dependent hierarchy adjustments within hierarchical processing frameworks. This can help in handling long sequences more efficiently and improving overall scalability.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop novel autoregressive LM blocks that are more efficient, scalable, and robust, ultimately leading to better performance in various tasks.\n",

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2.

This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models serve as the backbone for a wide range of tasks across Artificial Intelligence due to their ability to learn complex interactions in large datasets [Bommasani et al., 2021]. In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Denis Xavier Charles, Eren Manavoglu, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2022)\t**Cited by** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SPADE augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods and demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code ${ }^{1}$ and pre-trained model checkpoints ${ }^{2}$ are publicly available. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Attention Mechanism\n\nSuppose the input to the layer is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the embedding dimension, then the attention mechanism outputs\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$. Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A.

Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces (Avg.

In this work we focus on autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and ArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nwhere decoding every token requires attending to the whole past. The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 5.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid ssm attention architectures implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid ssm attention architectures implementation*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by incorporating hybrid architectures that combine state-space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your search criteria:\n\n## Hybrid SSM-Attention Architectures\n\n### Zamba2-7B\nThe Zamba2-7B model is a prominent example of a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba (SSM) layers with transformer blocks. This model alternates between Mamba layers and shared transformer blocks, utilizing techniques like LoRA projectors to enhance expressivity and rotary position embeddings to improve performance. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among models with \u22648B parameters, with advantages in inference latency and memory footprint compared to pure transformer models.\n\n### Falcon Mamba\nFalcon Mamba 7B is another hybrid model that combines SSMs with attention layers. This architecture leverages the efficiency of SSMs in handling long sequences without the significant memory and computational costs associated with transformers. The hybrid design outperforms pure transformer and SSM models in various language tasks, highlighting the complementary strengths of both architectures.\n\n### Taipan\nThe Taipan architecture introduces a hybrid model that combines the efficiency of Mamba-2 (a variant of SSMs) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to enhance long-range dependency handling. This design balances the computational efficiency of SSMs with the expressive power of attention mechanisms, making it suitable for tasks requiring both speed and accurate information retrieval.\n\n## Performance Comparisons\n\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: Hybrid models like Zamba2-7B and Falcon Mamba show improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional transformer models. They achieve lower inference latency and reduced memory usage, making them more suitable for real-world applications.\n- **Long-Sequence Handling**: SSM-based hybrid models are particularly efficient in handling long sequences due to their ability to store and attend to recurrent states rather than the entire sequence context. This is demonstrated in the Falcon Mamba model, which outperforms transformer models in memory usage and generation throughput for long sequences.\n\n## Practical Implementations\n\n- **Mamba Layers**: The integration of Mamba layers with transformer blocks is a common theme in these hybrid architectures. Mamba layers provide the efficiency and scalability needed for large language models, while transformer blocks enhance the model's ability to handle complex dependencies and context.\n- **LoRA Projectors and Rotary Embeddings**: Techniques like LoRA projectors and rotary position embeddings are used to enhance the expressivity and performance of these hybrid models. These methods allow for depth-specialization and improved positional encoding without significant additional parameter overhead.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Investigating techniques for dynamic adaptation of computation paradigms, such as the three-paradigm approach in RetNet (parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent), could further optimize the performance and efficiency of hybrid SSM-attention architectures.\n- **Memory-Efficient State Expansion**: Methods like adaptive KV cache compression and compressed state representation can be integrated into these hybrid models to optimize memory usage and improve overall efficiency.\n\nThese findings and references provide a solid foundation for improving autoregressive language model design by leveraging the strengths of both state-space models and attention mechanisms.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state management hybrid language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2891  (*Influential: 536*)\n\n#### 2.

Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapters, Parallel adapter, Prompt-based learning and Reparametrization-based methods. Moreover, we conduct extensive empirical studies on the impact of adapter types, placement locations, and hyper-parameters to the best design for each adapter-based methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of the adapters on fourteen datasets from two different reasoning tasks, Arithmetic Reasoning and Commonsense Reasoning. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on both reasoning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 4.

Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B.

Our approach is structured around three key dimensions: We strive to ensure our data is diverse, scalable, and extensively covers real-world scenarios including web screenshots, PDFs, OCR, charts, and knowledge-based content, aiming for a comprehensive representation of practical contexts. Further, we create a use case taxonomy from real user scenarios and construct an instruction tuning dataset accordingly. The fine-tuning with this dataset substantially improves the model's user experience in practical applications. Considering efficiency and the demands of most real-world scenarios, DeepSeek-VL incorporates a hybrid vision encoder that efficiently processes high-resolution images (1024 x 1024), while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead. This design choice ensures the model's ability to capture critical semantic and detailed information across various visual tasks. We posit that a proficient Vision-Language Model should, foremost, possess strong language abilities. To ensure the preservation of LLM capabilities during pretraining, we investigate an effective VL pretraining strategy by integrating LLM training from the beginning and carefully managing the competitive dynamics observed between vision and language modalities. The DeepSeek-VL family (both 1.3B and 7B models) showcases superior user experiences as a vision-language chatbot in real-world applications, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of visual-language benchmarks at the same model size while maintaining robust performance on language-centric benchmarks.

GRILLBot In Practice: Lessons and Tradeoffs Deploying Large Language Models for Adaptable Conversational Task Assistants\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hybrid language models*\n\n*Jeffrey Dalton, Federico Rossetto, Iain Mackie, Niklas Tecklenburg, Carlos Gemmell, Sophie Fischer*\n\n**Abstract:** We tackle the challenge of building real-world multimodal assistants for complex real-world tasks. We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on efficient state management and dynamic adaptation in hybrid language models, here are some relevant findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Efficient State Management\n\n### HCache for State Restoration\nThe paper on \"Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache\" introduces a novel method for managing contextual states in large language models (LLMs). HCache optimizes the restoration of LLM states by utilizing intermediate activations, reducing both computational and I/O overheads. This approach involves transmitting hidden states to GPU memory and recomputing them into the KV cache, which can be done concurrently to utilize both IO and computational resources efficiently.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nHybrid models like the Block-State Transformers (BST) combine State Space Models (SSMs) for long-range contextualization with block-wise attention for short-term representation. This integration allows for efficient state management by leveraging the strengths of both SSMs and attention mechanisms. BST internally combines an SSM sublayer and a Block Transformer sublayer, which can help in managing states efficiently.\n\n## Dynamic Adaptation\n\n### Dynamic Activation of Attention Modules\nThe concept of Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) enables dynamic activation of attention modules, which can be crucial for computational efficiency. SMA allows the model to selectively activate different attention modules based on the input, reducing unnecessary computations and improving overall efficiency.\n\n### Hierarchical and Tiling Strategies\nImplementations like those described in the CHELA paper and DenseMamba preprint emphasize the use of tiling and hierarchical processing to achieve hardware efficiency. These strategies can help in dynamically adapting the model's processing by efficiently managing the flow of information through the network, ensuring that only necessary computations are performed.\n\n## Computational Optimization\n\n### Optimizers and Preconditioning\nEfficient training of large models can be achieved through advanced optimizers. Techniques like Shampoo and Adagrad, which store preconditioners, can converge quicker than traditional optimizers like Adam. These methods can help in reducing the memory load and improving convergence speed, which is critical for large language models.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\nThe integration of reinforcement learning agents with scripted agents in a hybrid hierarchical AI framework can optimize decision-making and resource usage. This approach, while more complex, can lead to better performance by leveraging the strengths of both scripted and reinforcement learning agents, ensuring efficient use of computational resources.\n\n## Summary of Key Techniques\n\n- **HCache for State Restoration**: Efficiently restore LLM states using intermediate activations to reduce computational and I/O overheads.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combine SSMs and attention mechanisms to leverage their complementary strengths for efficient state management.\n- **Dynamic Activation**: Use Sparse Modular Activation to dynamically activate attention modules, reducing unnecessary computations.\n- **Hierarchical and Tiling Strategies**: Implement tiling and hierarchical processing to achieve hardware efficiency and dynamic adaptation.\n- **Advanced Optimizers**: Utilize optimizers like Shampoo and Adagrad for faster convergence and reduced memory load.\n- **Hardware-Aware Design**: Optimize resource usage through hybrid hierarchical AI frameworks that integrate different types of agents.\n\nThese techniques can help in designing more efficient and adaptable autoregressive language models, focusing on memory efficiency, computational optimization, and dynamic state management.\n",

Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts (Avg.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/40 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\n# Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts \n\nAlexis Chevalier* Alexander Wettig* Anirudh Ajith Danqi Chen<br>Department of Computer Science \\& Princeton Language and Intelligence<br>Princeton University<br>\\{achevalier, anirudh.ajith\\}@princeton.edu<br>\\{awettig, danqic\\}@cs.princeton.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents.\n```\n\n#### 2. Soaring from 4K to 400K: Extending LLM\u2019s Context with Activation Beacon (Avg. Score: 0.44)\n\n*Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts and works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The utilization of long contexts poses a big challenge for LLMs due to their limited context window size. Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

The Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Trees (R2D2) makes it possible to scale to large language model pretraining even with a complex tree encoder, by introducing a heuristic pruning method.However, its rule-based pruning process suffers from local optima and slow inference. In this paper, we propose a unified R2D2 method that overcomes these issues. We use a top-down unsupervised parser as a model-guided pruning method, which also enables parallel encoding during inference. Our parser casts parsing as a split point scoring task by first scoring all split points for a given sentence and then using the highest-scoring one to recursively split a span into two parts. The reverse order of the splits is considered as the order of pruning in the encoder. We optimize the unsupervised parser by minimizing the Kullback\u2013Leibler distance between tree probabilities from the parser and the R2D2 model.Our experiments show that our Fast-R2D2 significantly improves the grammar induction quality and achieves competitive results in downstream tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/26 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nACL.

Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion Tokens (Avg. Score: 0.36)\n\n*Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The $\\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: it is found that the $\\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction, and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/36 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\n2024.

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model (Avg. Score: 0.35)\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences, and develops an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification, establishing the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the inductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence length. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an appealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient decoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show MambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits of token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of efficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference speedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding efficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/40 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.11131, 2024.

H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical heavy hitter attention implementation*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/H2O.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 112  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating hierarchical processing with adaptive token selection and compression, here are some relevant findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Adaptive Token Selection\n\n### Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP)\nThe paper on Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) proposes a method that reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to \\(O(T \\log T)\\), which is particularly useful for hierarchical processing. HiP could be integrated with heavy-hitter token identification to further optimize the attention mechanism.\n\n### Attention-Gate (AG) for KV-Cache Eviction\nThe \"In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate\" paper introduces an Attention-Gate (AG) module that dynamically identifies and retains or discards tokens in the KV-Cache based on their importance. This approach uses either local or global information to guide the eviction policy, which can be crucial for hierarchical and adaptive token selection. The global attention-like structure in AG ensures that the eviction decisions are informed by the broader context, aligning well with hierarchical processing needs.\n\n## Heavy-Hitter Token Identification and Compression\n\n### Heavy-Hitter Oracle (H2O)\nThe H2O approach identifies and preserves important tokens, known as \"Heavy Hitters,\" which contribute most to the attention scores. This method can be combined with hierarchical processing to ensure that only the most critical tokens are processed at each level of the hierarchy. H2O's adaptive eviction policies can be integrated with HiP or AG to optimize memory and computational efficiency.\n\n### Dynamic Adaptation of Compression Rates\nThe MoA (Mixture of Sparse Attention) paper discusses automatic tailoring of sparse attention configurations based on input sequence lengths. This dynamic adaptation can be extended to incorporate hierarchical processing, where different levels of the hierarchy may use different sparse attention patterns and compression rates. This ensures that the model adapts efficiently to varying input characteristics.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations and Hybrid Architectures\n\n### PagedAttention and Efficient Memory Management\nPagedAttention provides efficient memory management strategies by dividing the attention mechanism into pages, which can be particularly beneficial when combined with hierarchical processing. This approach ensures that only relevant tokens are processed and stored, reducing memory footprint and improving efficiency.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nThe concept of hybrid architectures, such as those discussed in the OrchestraLLM paper, involves efficient routing between different model scales. This can be integrated with hierarchical processing to dynamically switch between different attention mechanisms and compression strategies based on the input context, optimizing both memory and computational resources.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical processing, adaptive token selection, and efficient compression strategies, thereby enhancing memory efficiency, computational optimization, and overall performance.\n",

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Score: 0.91)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

As a result, their performance suffers drastically on inputs longer than those encountered during training, substantially limiting their applications in real-world tasks involving long contexts such as encod- ing scientific articles, code repositories, or long dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, this work identifies three major factors contributing to this length generalization failure. Our theoretical analysis reveals that commonly used techniques like using a sliding-window attention pattern or relative positional encodings are inadequate to address them. Answering these challenges, we propose LM-Infinite, a simple and effective method for enhancing LLMs\u2019 capabilities of handling long contexts. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and can be used with most modern LLMs off-the-shelf. Without any parameter updates, it allows LLMs pre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to generalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining perplexity. It also improves performance on downstream tasks such as Passkey Retrieval and Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves 2.7\u00d7 decoding speed up and 7.5\u00d7 memory saving over the original model. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/37 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn Proc.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 5.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

While All-MLP ar-003 chitectures have demonstrated reasonable per-004 formance in computer vision and garnered re-005 cent interest, we argue that making them ef-006 fective in NLP applications is still an uphill 007 battle. Hence, there may be no solid rea-008 son to drop the self-attention modules alto-009 gether. In this paper, we propose a new 010 Mixer-Transformer architecture, showing that 011 Transformers and Mixer models can be quite 012 complementary indeed. Fundamentally, we 013 show that Mixer models are capable of act-014 ing as persistent global memory (in a simi-015 lar vein to standard MLPs) while being im-016 bued with global receptive \ufb01elds at the same 017 time. Hence, interleaving sample-dependent 018 and input-local self-attention with persistent 019 Mixer modules can be an effective strategy. 020 Additionally, we propose compositional remix-021 ing, a new way of baking compositional op-022 erators (multiplicative and subtractive compo-023 sition) within the mixing process to improve 024 the expressiveness of the model. This allows 025 us to effectively model relationships between 026 unmixed and mixed representations - an induc-027 tive bias that we postulate is powerful for NLU 028 applications. Via extensive experiments on 14 029 challenging NLU datasets (e.g., SuperGLUE, 030 entailment and compositional generalization), 031 we show that the proposed architecture consis-032 tently outperforms a strong T5 baseline (Raf-033 fel et al., 2019).

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 461  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nRodrigo Nogueira, Zhiying Jiang, and Jimmy J.

Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. To Repeat or Not To Repeat: Insights from Scaling LLM under Token-Crisis\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization*\n\n*Fuzhao Xue, Yao Fu, Wangchunshu Zhou, Zangwei Zheng, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study empirically investigates the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation, and discovers that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research has highlighted the importance of dataset size in scaling language models. However, large language models (LLMs) are notoriously token-hungry during pre-training, and high-quality text data on the web is approaching its scaling limit for LLMs. To further enhance LLMs, a straightforward approach is to repeat the pre-training data for additional epochs. In this study, we empirically investigate three key aspects under this approach. First, we explore the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation. Second, we examine the key factors contributing to multi-epoch degradation, finding that significant factors include dataset size, model parameters, and training objectives, while less influential factors consist of dataset quality and model FLOPs. Finally, we explore whether widely used regularization can alleviate multi-epoch degradation. Most regularization techniques do not yield significant improvements, except for dropout, which demonstrates remarkable effectiveness but requires careful tuning when scaling up the model size. Additionally, we discover that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters, potentially impacting efficient LLM development on a broader scale.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token compression*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token compression*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward\"drop-in\"integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. TCRA-LLM: Token Compression Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model for Inference Cost Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token compression*\n\n*Junyi Liu, Liangzhi Li, Tong Xiang, Bowen Wang, Yiming Qian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A token compression scheme that includes two methods: summarization compression and semantic compression is proposed that can reduce 65% of the retrieval token size and provides a more flexible way to trade-off the token size with performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Since ChatGPT released its API for public use, the number of applications built on top of commercial large language models (LLMs) increase exponentially. One popular usage of such models is leveraging its in-context learning ability and generating responses given user queries leveraging knowledge obtained by retrieval augmentation. One problem of deploying commercial retrieval-augmented LLMs is the cost due to the additionally retrieved context that largely increases the input token size of the LLMs. To mitigate this, we propose a token compression scheme that includes two methods: summarization compression and semantic compression. The first method applies a T5-based model that is fine-tuned by datasets generated using self-instruct containing samples with varying lengths and reduce token size by doing summarization. The second method further compresses the token size by removing words with lower impact on the semantic. In order to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we propose and utilize a dataset called Food-Recommendation DB (FRDB) focusing on food recommendation for women around pregnancy period or infants. Our summarization compression can reduce 65% of the retrieval token size with further 0.3% improvement on the accuracy; semantic compression provides a more flexible way to trade-off the token size with performance, for which we can reduce the token size by 20% with only 1.6% of accuracy drop.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: heavy hitter tokens transformer*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

Expediting Large-Scale Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction without Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: heavy hitter tokens transformer*\n\n*Weicong Liang, Yuhui Yuan, Henghui Ding, Xiao Luo, Weihong Lin, Ding Jia, Zheng Zhang, Chao Zhang, Hanhua Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two non-parametric operators are presented, a token clustering layer to decrease the number of tokens and a token reconstruction layer to increase the number of tokens, in response to the fact that high-resolution representations are necessary for dense prediction.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have recently achieved competitive results across various vision tasks but still suffer from heavy computation costs when processing a large number of tokens. Many advanced approaches have been developed to reduce the total number of tokens in large-scale vision transformers, especially for image classification tasks. Typically, they select a small group of essential tokens according to their relevance with the class token, then fine-tune the weights of the vision transformer. Such fine-tuning is less practical for dense prediction due to the much heavier computation and GPU memory cost than image classification. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging problem, i.e., accelerating large-scale vision transformers for dense prediction without any additional re-training or fine-tuning. In response to the fact that high-resolution representations are necessary for dense prediction, we present two non-parametric operators, a token clustering layer to decrease the number of tokens and a token reconstruction layer to increase the number of tokens. The following steps are performed to achieve this: (i) we use the token clustering layer to cluster the neighboring tokens together, resulting in low-resolution representations that maintain the spatial structures; (ii) we apply the following transformer layers only to these low-resolution representations or clustered tokens; and (iii) we use the token reconstruction layer to re-create the high-resolution representations from the refined low-resolution representations. The results obtained by our method are promising on five dense prediction tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, instance segmentation, and depth estimation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9. VCR-Graphormer: A Mini-batch Graph Transformer via Virtual Connections\n\n*From Search Query: heavy hitter tokens transformer*\n\n*Dongqi Fu, Zhigang Hua, Yan Xie, Jin Fang, Si Zhang, Kaan Sancak, Hao Wu, Andrey Malevich, Jingrui He, Bo Long*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work rewire graphs by introducing multiple types of virtual connections through structure- and content-based super nodes that enable PPR tokenization to encode local and global contexts, long-range interaction, and heterophilous information into each node's token list, and formalize the Virtual Connection Ranking based Graph Transformer (VCR-Graphormer).\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformer has been proven as an effective graph learning method for its adoption of attention mechanism that is capable of capturing expressive representations from complex topological and feature information of graphs. Graph transformer conventionally performs dense attention (or global attention) for every pair of nodes to learn node representation vectors, resulting in quadratic computational costs that are unaffordable for large-scale graph data. Therefore, mini-batch training for graph transformers is a promising direction, but limited samples in each mini-batch can not support effective dense attention to encode informative representations. Facing this bottleneck, (1) we start by assigning each node a token list that is sampled by personalized PageRank (PPR) and then apply standard multi-head self-attention only on this list to compute its node representations. This PPR tokenization method decouples model training from complex graph topological information and makes heavy feature engineering offline and independent, such that mini-batch training of graph transformers is possible by loading each node's token list in batches. We further prove this PPR tokenization is viable as a graph convolution network with a fixed polynomial filter and jumping knowledge. However, only using personalized PageRank may limit information carried by a token list, which could not support different graph inductive biases for model training. To this end, (2) we rewire graphs by introducing multiple types of virtual connections through structure- and content-based super nodes that enable PPR tokenization to encode local and global contexts, long-range interaction, and heterophilous information into each node's token list, and then formalize our Virtual Connection Ranking based Graph Transformer (VCR-Graphormer).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 10. LipsFormer: Introducing Lipschitz Continuity to Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: importance weighted normalization transformers*\n\n*Xianbiao Qi, Jianan Wang, Yihao Chen, Yukai Shi, Lei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a Lipschitz continuous Transformer, called LipsFormer, to pursue training stability both theoretically and empirically for Transformer-based models. In contrast to previous practical tricks that address training instability by learning rate warmup, layer normalization, attention formulation, and weight initialization, we show that Lipschitz continuity is a more essential property to ensure training stability. In LipsFormer, we replace unstable Transformer component modules with Lipschitz continuous counterparts: CenterNorm instead of LayerNorm, spectral initialization instead of Xavier initialization, scaled cosine similarity attention instead of dot-product attention, and weighted residual shortcut. We prove that these introduced modules are Lipschitz continuous and derive an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of LipsFormer. Our experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization. As a result, on the ImageNet 1K dataset, LipsFormer-Swin-Tiny based on Swin Transformer training for 300 epochs can obtain 82.7\\% without any learning rate warmup. Moreover, LipsFormer-CSwin-Tiny, based on CSwin, training for 300 epochs achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.5\\% with 4.7G FLOPs and 24M parameters.

Revisiting Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: importance weighted normalization transformers*\n\n*Zexi Li, Tao Lin, Xinyi Shang, Chao Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that the sum of weights can be smaller than 1, causing global weight shrinking effect (analogous to weight decay) and improving generalization and an effective method for Federated Learning with Learnable Aggregation Weights is proposed, named as FedLAW.\n\n**Abstract:** In federated learning (FL), weighted aggregation of local models is conducted to generate a global model, and the aggregation weights are normalized (the sum of weights is 1) and proportional to the local data sizes. In this paper, we revisit the weighted aggregation process and gain new insights into the training dynamics of FL. First, we find that the sum of weights can be smaller than 1, causing global weight shrinking effect (analogous to weight decay) and improving generalization. We explore how the optimal shrinking factor is affected by clients' data heterogeneity and local epochs. Second, we dive into the relative aggregation weights among clients to depict the clients' importance. We develop client coherence to study the learning dynamics and find a critical point that exists. Before entering the critical point, more coherent clients play more essential roles in generalization. Based on the above insights, we propose an effective method for Federated Learning with Learnable Aggregation Weights, named as FedLAW. Extensive experiments verify that our method can improve the generalization of the global model by a large margin on different datasets and models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 12. Language model compression with weighted low-rank factorization\n\n*From Search Query: importance weighted normalization transformers*\n\n*Yen-Chang Hsu, Ting Hua, Sung-En Chang, Qiang Lou, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Fisher-Weighted SVD method can directly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than other compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training.\n\n**Abstract:** Factorizing a large matrix into small matrices is a popular strategy for model compression. Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a vital role in this compression strategy, approximating a learned matrix with fewer parameters. However, SVD minimizes the squared error toward reconstructing the original matrix without gauging the importance of the parameters, potentially giving a larger reconstruction error for those who affect the task accuracy more. In other words, the optimization objective of SVD is not aligned with the trained model's task accuracy. We analyze this previously unexplored problem, make observations, and address it by introducing Fisher information to weigh the importance of parameters affecting the model prediction. This idea leads to our method: Fisher-Weighted SVD (FWSVD). Although the factorized matrices from our approach do not result in smaller reconstruction errors, we find that our resulting task accuracy is much closer to the original model's performance. We perform analysis with the transformer-based language models, showing our weighted SVD largely alleviates the mismatched optimization objectives and can maintain model performance with a higher compression rate. Our method can directly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than other compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training. Moreover, the evaluation of compressing an already compact model shows our method can further reduce 9% to 30% parameters with an insignificant impact on task accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 13.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers token compression*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 15.

Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity.

ZEN: Pre-training Chinese Text Encoder Enhanced by N-gram Representations\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization*\n\n*Jiaxin Bai, Yan Song, Shizhe Diao, Yonggang Wang, Tong Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-training of text encoders normally processes text as a sequence of tokens corresponding to small text units, such as word pieces in English and characters in Chinese. It omits information carried by larger text granularity, and thus the encoders cannot easily adapt to certain combinations of characters. This leads to a loss of important semantic information, which is especially problematic for Chinese because the language does not have explicit word boundaries. In this paper, we propose ZEN, a BERT-based Chinese (Z) text encoder Enhanced by N-gram representations, where different combinations of characters are considered during training. As a result, potential word or phase boundaries are explicitly pre-trained and fine-tuned with the character encoder (BERT). Therefore ZEN incorporates the comprehensive information of both the character sequence and words or phrases it contains. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of ZEN on a series of Chinese NLP tasks. We show that ZEN, using less resource than other published encoders, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most tasks. Moreover, it is shown that reasonable performance can be obtained when ZEN is trained on a small corpus, which is important for applying pre-training techniques to scenarios with limited data. The code and pre-trained models of ZEN are available at https://github.com/sinovation/zen.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-of-the-association-for-computational\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. The CMU METAL Farsi NLP Approach\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization*\n\n*Mehdi Manshadi, Weston Feely, Lori Levin, Robert Frederking*\n\n**Abstract:** While many high-quality tools are available for analyzing major languages such as English, equivalent freely-available tools for important but lower-resourced languages such as Farsi are more difficult to acquire and integrate into a useful NLP front end. We report here on an accurate and efficient Farsi analysis front end that we have assembled, which may be useful to others who wish to work with written Farsi. The pre-existing components and resources that we incorporated include the Carnegie Mellon TurboParser and TurboTagger (Martins et al., 2010) trained on the Dadegan Treebank (Rasooli et al., 2013), the Uppsala Farsi text normalizer PrePer (Seraji, 2013), the Uppsala Farsi tokenizer (Seraji et al., 2012a), and Jon Dehdari\u00c2\u2019s PerStem (Jadidinejad et al., 2010). This set of tools (combined with additional normalization and tokenization modules that we have developed and made available) achieves a dependency parsing labeled attachment score of 89.49{\\%}, unlabeled attachment score of 92.19{\\%}, and label accuracy score of 91.38{\\%} on a held-out parsing test data set. All of the components and resources used are freely available.

However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT standard as a tokenizer while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 4.

BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 5. TorchMD-NET: Equivariant Transformers for Neural Network based Molecular Potentials\n\n*From Search Query: importance weighted normalization transformers*\n\n*Gianni de Fabritiis, Philipp Th\u00f6lke*\n\n**Abstract:** The prediction of quantum mechanical properties is historically plagued by a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Machine learning potentials have previously shown great success in this domain, reaching increasingly better accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency comparable with classical force fields. In this work we propose TorchMD-NET, a novel equivariant transformer (ET) architecture, outperforming state-of-the-art on MD17, ANI-1, and many QM9 targets in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Through an extensive attention weight analysis, we gain valuable insights into the black box predictor and show differences in the learned representation of conformers versus conformations sampled from molecular dynamics or normal modes. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of datasets including off-equilibrium conformations for the evaluation of molecular potentials.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. How should spin-weighted spherical functions be defined?\n\n*From Search Query: importance weighted normalization transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Spin-weighted spherical functions provide a useful tool for analyzing tensor-valued functions on the sphere. A tensor field can be decomposed into complex-valued functions by taking contractions with tangent vectors on the sphere and the normal to the sphere. These component functions are usually presented as functions on the sphere itself, but this requires an implicit choice of distinguished tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may more accurately say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of both a point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at that point. The distinction becomes extremely important when transforming the coordinates in which these functions are expressed, because the implicit choice of frame will also transform. Here, it is proposed that spin-weighted spherical functions should be treated as functions on the spin group. This approach more cleanly reflects the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant description of the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of the Wigner $\\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under rotation are simple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator are defined directly in terms of the spin group; one is the standard angular-momentum operator $\\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to be related to the spin-raising operator $\\eth$. Computer code is also included, providing an explicit implementation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics in this form.\n\n**Published:** 2016-04-27\n\n\n\n#### 7. Simple and Controllable Music Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers token compression*\n\n*Alexandre D\u00e9fossez, Yossi Adi, Gabriel Synnaeve, David Kant, Tal Remez, Itai Gat, Felix Kreuk, Jade Copet*\n\n**Abstract:** We tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, both mono and stereo, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen. Music samples, code, and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 8. ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformers token compression*\n\n*Bo Zheng, Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Jun Song, Yuan Gao, Jiale Yuan, ZiMing Wang, Sijie Cheng, Chunjiang Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** High-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter the challenges of excessive visual tokens and quadratic visual complexity. Current high-resolution LMMs address the quadratic complexity while still generating excessive visual tokens. However, the redundancy in visual tokens is the key problem as it leads to more substantial compute. To mitigate this issue, we propose ConvLLaVA, which employs ConvNeXt, a hierarchical backbone, as the visual encoder of LMM to replace Vision Transformer (ViT). ConvLLaVA compresses high-resolution images into information-rich visual features, effectively preventing the generation of excessive visual tokens. To enhance the capabilities of ConvLLaVA, we propose two critical optimizations. Since the low-resolution pretrained ConvNeXt underperforms when directly applied on high resolution, we update it to bridge the gap. Moreover, since ConvNeXt's original compression ratio is inadequate for much higher resolution inputs, we train a successive stage to further compress the visual tokens, thereby reducing redundancy. These optimizations enable ConvLLaVA to support inputs of 1536x1536 resolution generating only 576 visual tokens, capable of handling images of arbitrary aspect ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks. The ConvLLaVA model series are publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba/conv-llava.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the **H2-HierarchicalLinearTransformer**, here are the key points and relevant information gathered from the analysis and search queries:\n\n## Key Aspects of the Proposal\n\n### Token Importance and Heavy-Hitter Token Identification\n- The proposal integrates **heavy-hitter token identification** to focus computational resources on important tokens. This is similar to the concept discussed in the paper \"Heavy Hitter Oracle for Efficient Transformer Inference\" where a heavy hitter oracle mechanism identifies important tokens during inference to allocate resources effectively.\n\n### Adaptive Compression\n- **Adaptive compression techniques** based on token importance are crucial. Research like \"Dynamic Token Pruning for Efficient Transformer Models\" shows how dynamic token pruning reduces computational overhead by removing less important tokens during inference, based on learned importance scores.\n\n### Importance-Weighted Normalization\n- The introduction of **H2RMSNorm**, a novel normalization layer that dynamically adjusts based on token importance, is a key component. This aligns with \"Importance Weighted Layer Normalization for Transformers\" which adjusts normalization parameters based on token importance scores computed during training.\n\n## Existing Methods and Novelty Assessment\n\n### Token Importance Estimation\n- Existing methods like \"Improving Transformer Efficiency with Token Importance Estimation\" estimate token importance to allocate computational resources more effectively.\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\n- Hierarchical transformers capture multi-scale dependencies, but integrating token importance and adaptive compression within these architectures is a novel approach. \"Hierarchical Transformers with Adaptive Token Pruning\" employs adaptive token pruning based on learned importance scores, but does not specifically integrate heavy-hitter token identification and importance-weighted normalization.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization\n- Adaptive normalization techniques that adjust parameters based on input characteristics have been explored, but the specific integration with heavy-hitter token identification and hierarchical processing is new.\n\n## Impact Analysis and Feasibility\n\n### Potential Improvements\n- The proposed design could lead to significant improvements in **efficiency**, **robustness**, and **scalability** by focusing on important tokens and adjusting normalization dynamically.\n- The integration of these techniques could enhance both training stability and model performance.\n\n### Feasibility and Theoretical Soundness\n- The theoretical soundness of the design is supported by existing research on token importance, adaptive compression, and adaptive normalization. However, implementing H2RMSNorm and integrating it with hierarchical processing may present challenges that need to be addressed.\n\n## Useful References and Insights\n\n### Token Importance and Adaptive Compression\n- \"Dynamic Token Pruning for Efficient Transformer Models\" by Chen and Zhou (2022) highlights the effectiveness of dynamic token pruning based on learned importance scores.\n- \"Heavy Hitter Oracle for Efficient Transformer Inference\" by Komba et al. (2022) discusses the heavy hitter oracle mechanism, which is crucial for the proposed design.\n\n### Importance-Weighted Normalization\n- \"Importance Weighted Layer Normalization for Transformers\" by Sharma and Patel (2023) provides insights into adjusting normalization parameters based on token importance scores.\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\n- \"Hierarchical Transformers with Adaptive Token Pruning\" by Zhao and Huang (2022) shows how hierarchical transformers can be made more efficient with adaptive token pruning, although it lacks the specific integration proposed.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Latest Developments\n- Review recent publications and preprints on arXiv and other repositories to ensure no similar integration has been proposed recently.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Explore potential challenges in implementing H2RMSNorm and integrating it with hierarchical processing. This includes compatibility with existing architectures and any necessary modifications.\n\n## Relevant Information from Search Results\n\n- The paper \"ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long Context LLM Inference\" discusses efficient KV selection and sparse KV cache reconstruction, which could be relevant for optimizing the proposed model's inference phase. It highlights the use of cosine similarity and low-rank pre-RoPE keys, which might be adapted for token importance-based compression and normalization.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can ensure that the **H2-HierarchicalLinearTransformer** is well-grounded in existing research while offering a novel and potentially impactful integration of techniques.\n",

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, M. Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Hierarchical Vector Quantized Transformer for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer token importance*\n\n*Ruiying Lu, Yujie Wu, Long Tian, Dongsheng Wang, Bo Chen, Xiyang Liu, Ruimin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework, and investigates an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised image Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to learn robust and discriminative representations of normal samples. While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the\"identical shortcut\"issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability.

A key limitation in existing work is effective modelling of temporal sequences within Transformer-based language models. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel approach for predicting \u2018Moments of Change\u2019 (MoC) in the mood of online users, by simultaneously considering users\u2019 linguistic and temporal context. A Hawkes process-inspired transformation layer is applied over a hierarchical transformer architecture to model the influence of time on users\u2019 posts \u2013 capturing both their immediate and historical dynamics. We perform experiments on the two existing datasets for the MoC task and showcase clear performance gains when leveraging the proposed layer. Our ablation study reveals the importance of considering temporal dynamics in detecting subtle and rare mood changes. Our results indicate that considering linguistic and temporal information in a hierarchical manner provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of modelling user generated content over time, with applications in mental health monitoring.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. HiViT: A Simpler and More Efficient Design of Hierarchical Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer token importance*\n\n*Xiaosong Zhang, Yunjie Tian, Lingxi Xie, Wei Huang, Qi Dai, Qixiang Ye, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT, which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning), after pre-trained using masked autoencoder on ImageNet-1K.\n\n**Abstract:** There has been a debate on the choice of plain vs. hierarchical vision transformers, where researchers often believe that the former (e.g., ViT) has a simpler design but the latter (e.g., Swin) enjoys higher recognition accuracy. Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility, i.e., part of image patches or tokens are to be discarded, which seems to claim the advantages of plain vision transformers. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning. In particular, after pre-trained using masked autoencoder (MAE) on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a 84.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, a 53.3% box AP on COCO detection, and a 52.8% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, significantly surpassing the baseline.

Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization methods*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization methods*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Incorporating Attribution Importance for Improving Faithfulness Metrics\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization methods*\n\n*Zhixue Zhao, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective soft erasure criterion is proposed that randomly mask parts of the token vector representations proportionately to their FA importance, showing that the soft-sufficiency and soft-comprehensiveness metrics consistently prefer more faithful explanations compared to hard sufficiency and comprehensiveness.\n\n**Abstract:** Feature attribution methods (FAs) are popular approaches for providing insights into the model reasoning process of making predictions. The more faithful a FA is, the more accurately it reflects which parts of the input are more important for the prediction. Widely used faithfulness metrics, such as sufficiency and comprehensiveness use a hard erasure criterion, i.e. entirely removing or retaining the top most important tokens ranked by a given FA and observing the changes in predictive likelihood. However, this hard criterion ignores the importance of each individual token, treating them all equally for computing sufficiency and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective soft erasure criterion. Instead of entirely removing or retaining tokens from the input, we randomly mask parts of the token vector representations proportionately to their FA importance. Extensive experiments across various natural language processing tasks and different FAs show that our soft-sufficiency and soft-comprehensiveness metrics consistently prefer more faithful explanations compared to hard sufficiency and comprehensiveness.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, both mono and stereo, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen.

DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer token importance*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie zhou, Jiwen Lu, Benlin Liu, Wenliang Zhao, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization methods*\n\n*Salman Avestimehr, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Chenyang Tao, Baturalp Buyukates, Duygu Nur Yaldiz, Yavuz Faruk Bakman*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.

CTformer: Convolution-free Token2Token Dilated Vision Transformer for Low-dose CT Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: token importance normalization methods*\n\n*Hengyong Yu, Fei Wang, Rui Liu, Zhan Wu, Fenglei Fan, Dayang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) denoising is an important problem in CT research. Compared to the normal dose CT (NDCT), LDCT images are subjected to severe noise and artifacts. Recently in many studies, vision transformers have shown superior feature representation ability over convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, unlike CNNs, the potential of vision transformers in LDCT denoising was little explored so far. To fill this gap, we propose a Convolution-free Token2Token Dilated Vision Transformer for low-dose CT denoising. The CTformer uses a more powerful token rearrangement to encompass local contextual information and thus avoids convolution. It also dilates and shifts feature maps to capture longer-range interaction. We interpret the CTformer by statically inspecting patterns of its internal attention maps and dynamically tracing the hierarchical attention flow with an explanatory graph. Furthermore, an overlapped inference mechanism is introduced to effectively eliminate the boundary artifacts that are common for encoder-decoder-based denoising models. Experimental results on Mayo LDCT dataset suggest that the CTformer outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising methods with a low computation overhead.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. PromptCIR: Blind Compressed Image Restoration with Prompt Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression in transformers 2024*\n\n*Zhibo Chen, Li Zhang, Shijie Zhao, Mengxi Guo, Ruoyu Feng, Yiting Lu, Xin Li, Bingchen Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Blind Compressed Image Restoration (CIR) has garnered significant attention due to its practical applications. It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR.

This supports the feasibility of integrating token importance into processing.\n\n   - **Adaptive Compression Techniques:**\n\n     - Adaptive token pruning and compression are active areas of research, with methods demonstrating significant efficiency gains. Integrating adaptive compression based on token importance in a hierarchical transformer is a promising approach.\n\n   - **Importance-Weighted Normalization:**\n\n     - Importance-weighted normalization methods adjust normalization parameters based on token significance, similar to the proposed H2RMSNorm. This indicates that the concept is grounded in existing research.\n\n   - **Novelty Assessment:**\n\n     - While individual components (token importance estimation, adaptive compression, importance-weighted normalization) have been explored, their integration within a hierarchical transformer using a specialized normalization layer (H2RMSNorm) appears novel.\n\n     - No existing work was found that combines heavy-hitter token identification, importance-aware normalization, and adaptive compression within hierarchical processing.\n\n   - **Potential Impact:**\n\n     - The proposed design could improve efficiency by reducing computational load and memory usage, focusing resources on important tokens.\n\n     - Dynamically adjusting normalization based on token importance may enhance model performance and stability.\n\n   - **Feasibility and Implementation Challenges:**\n\n     - Implementing H2RMSNorm requires careful design to ensure stability and compatibility with existing training procedures.\n\n     - Integrating adaptive compression and token importance estimation may introduce additional computational overhead during training.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan:**\n\n   - **Investigate Recent Works:**\n\n     - Search for the latest papers (from 2023-2024) that might have proposed similar integrations, especially in arXiv preprints and conference proceedings.\n\n     - Look for any patents or less-publicized works that may overlap with the proposal's ideas.\n\n   - **Explore Implementation Details:**\n\n     - Seek out technical papers or implementation guides on importance-weighted normalization layers and their stability during training.\n\n     - Investigate methods for efficient token importance estimation and their integration into transformer architectures.\n\n   - **Assess Practicality:**\n\n     - Look for any benchmarks or empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating these techniques in real-world models.\n\n5. **List of References:**\n\n   - Zhang, Z., Sheng, Y., Zhou, T., et al.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Data-independent Module-aware Pruning for Hierarchical Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: importance-aware normalization hierarchical transformers 2024*\n\n*Yang He, Joey Tianyi Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel weight metric is introduced that is solely based on weights and does not require input images, thereby eliminating the dependence on the patch merging process and validates its usefulness and strengths on Swin Transformers of different sizes on ImageNet-1k classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical vision transformers (ViTs) have two advantages over conventional ViTs. First, hierarchical ViTs achieve linear computational complexity with respect to image size by local self-attention. Second, hierarchical ViTs create hierarchical feature maps by merging image patches in deeper layers for dense prediction. However, existing pruning methods ignore the unique properties of hierarchical ViTs and use the magnitude value as the weight importance. This approach leads to two main drawbacks. First, the\"local\"attention weights are compared at a\"global\"level, which may cause some\"locally\"important weights to be pruned due to their relatively small magnitude\"globally\". The second issue with magnitude pruning is that it fails to consider the distinct weight distributions of the network, which are essential for extracting coarse to fine-grained features at various hierarchical levels. To solve the aforementioned issues, we have developed a Data-independent Module-Aware Pruning method (DIMAP) to compress hierarchical ViTs. To ensure that\"local\"attention weights at different hierarchical levels are compared fairly in terms of their contribution, we treat them as a module and examine their contribution by analyzing their information distortion. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weight metric that is solely based on weights and does not require input images, thereby eliminating the dependence on the patch merging process. Our method validates its usefulness and strengths on Swin Transformers of different sizes on ImageNet-1k classification. Notably, the top-5 accuracy drop is only 0.07% when we remove 52.5% FLOPs and 52.7% parameters of Swin-B. When we reduce 33.2% FLOPs and 33.2% parameters of Swin-S, we can even achieve a 0.8% higher relative top-5 accuracy than the original model.

Exciting Mood Changes: A Time-aware Hierarchical Transformer for Change Detection Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: importance-aware normalization hierarchical transformers 2024*\n\n*Anthony Hills, Talia Tseriotou, Xenia Miscouridou, Adam Tsakalidis, M. Liakata*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel approach for predicting \u2018Moments of Change\u2019 (MoC) in the mood of online users, by simultaneously considering users\u2019 linguistic and temporal context within a hierarchical transformer architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** Longitudinal language modelling has been receiving increasing attention, especially in downstream tasks such as mental health monitoring of individuals where modelling linguistic content in a temporal fashion is crucial. A key limitation in existing work is effective modelling of temporal sequences within Transformer-based language models. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel approach for predicting \u2018Moments of Change\u2019 (MoC) in the mood of online users, by simultaneously considering users\u2019 linguistic and temporal context. A Hawkes process-inspired transformation layer is applied over a hierarchical transformer architecture to model the influence of time on users\u2019 posts \u2013 capturing both their immediate and historical dynamics. We perform experiments on the two existing datasets for the MoC task and showcase clear performance gains when leveraging the proposed layer. Our ablation study reveals the importance of considering temporal dynamics in detecting subtle and rare mood changes. Our results indicate that considering linguistic and temporal information in a hierarchical manner provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of modelling user generated content over time, with applications in mental health monitoring.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Improving Multi-Document Summarization through Referenced Flexible Extraction with Credit-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: importance-aware normalization hierarchical transformers 2024*\n\n*Yun-Zhu Song, Yi-Syuan Chen, Hong-Han Shuai*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a loss weighting mechanism that makes the model aware of the unequal importance for the sentences not in the pseudo extraction oracle, and leverage the fine-tuned abstractor to generate summary references as auxiliary signals for learning the extractor.\n\n**Abstract:** A notable challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is the extremely-long length of the input. In this paper, we present an extract-then-abstract Transformer framework to overcome the problem. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained language models to construct a hierarchical extractor for salient sentence selection across documents and an abstractor for rewriting the selected contents as summaries. However, learning such a framework is challenging since the optimal contents for the abstractor are generally unknown. Previous works typically create pseudo extraction oracle to enable the supervised learning for both the extractor and the abstractor. Nevertheless, we argue that the performance of such methods could be restricted due to the insufficient information for prediction and inconsistent objectives between training and testing. To this end, we propose a loss weighting mechanism that makes the model aware of the unequal importance for the sentences not in the pseudo extraction oracle, and leverage the fine-tuned abstractor to generate summary references as auxiliary signals for learning the extractor. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method that can efficiently apply to the extractor for harmonizing the optimization between training and testing. Experiment results show that our framework substantially outperforms strong baselines with comparable model sizes and achieves the best results on the Multi-News, Multi-XScience, and WikiCatSum corpora.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Bag of Tricks for Training Data Extraction from Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: token importance-based normalization in language models*\n\n*Weichen Yu, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Chao Du, Bingyi Kang, Yan Huang, Min Lin, Shuicheng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction, and proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** With the advance of language models, privacy protection is receiving more attention. Training data extraction is therefore of great importance, as it can serve as a potential tool to assess privacy leakage. However, due to the difficulty of this task, most of the existing methods are proof-of-concept and still not effective enough. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction. Based on the GPT-Neo 1.3B evaluation results, our proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research.

Sequential Integrated Gradients: a simple but effective method for explaining language models\n\n*From Search Query: token importance-based normalization in language models*\n\n*Joseph Enguehard*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Sequential Integrated Gradients (SIG), which computes the importance of each word in a sentence by keeping fixed every other words, only creating interpolations between the baseline and the word of interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Several explanation methods such as Integrated Gradients (IG) can be characterised as path-based methods, as they rely on a straight line between the data and an uninformative baseline. However, when applied to language models, these methods produce a path for each word of a sentence simultaneously, which could lead to creating sentences from interpolated words either having no clear meaning, or having a significantly different meaning compared to the original sentence. In order to keep the meaning of these sentences as close as possible to the original one, we propose Sequential Integrated Gradients (SIG), which computes the importance of each word in a sentence by keeping fixed every other words, only creating interpolations between the baseline and the word of interest. Moreover, inspired by the training procedure of several language models, we also propose to replace the baseline token\"pad\"with the trained token\"mask\". While being a simple improvement over the original IG method, we show on various models and datasets that SIG proves to be a very effective method for explaining language models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Incorporating Residual and Normalization Layers into Analysis of Masked Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: token importance-based normalization in language models*\n\n*Goro Kobayashi, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Sho Yokoi, Kentaro Inui*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed, and provides new intuitive explanations of existing reports.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has become ubiquitous in the natural language processing field. To interpret the Transformer-based models, their attention patterns have been extensively analyzed. However, the Transformer architecture is not only composed of the multi-head attention; other components can also contribute to Transformers\u2019 progressive performance. In this study, we extended the scope of the analysis of Transformers from solely the attention patterns to the whole attention block, i.e., multi-head attention, residual connection, and layer normalization. Our analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed. These results provide new intuitive explanations of existing reports; for example, discarding the learned attention patterns tends not to adversely affect the performance. The codes of our experiments are publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ZEN: Pre-training Chinese Text Encoder Enhanced by N-gram Representations\n\n*From Search Query: token importance-based normalization in language models*\n\n*Jiaxin Bai, Yan Song, Shizhe Diao, Yonggang Wang, Tong Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-training of text encoders normally processes text as a sequence of tokens corresponding to small text units, such as word pieces in English and characters in Chinese. It omits information carried by larger text granularity, and thus the encoders cannot easily adapt to certain combinations of characters. This leads to a loss of important semantic information, which is especially problematic for Chinese because the language does not have explicit word boundaries. In this paper, we propose ZEN, a BERT-based Chinese (Z) text encoder Enhanced by N-gram representations, where different combinations of characters are considered during training. As a result, potential word or phase boundaries are explicitly pre-trained and fine-tuned with the character encoder (BERT). Therefore ZEN incorporates the comprehensive information of both the character sequence and words or phrases it contains. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of ZEN on a series of Chinese NLP tasks. We show that ZEN, using less resource than other published encoders, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most tasks. Moreover, it is shown that reasonable performance can be obtained when ZEN is trained on a small corpus, which is important for applying pre-training techniques to scenarios with limited data. The code and pre-trained models of ZEN are available at https://github.com/sinovation/zen.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-of-the-association-for-computational\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: token importance-based normalization in language models*\n\n*Salman Avestimehr, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Chenyang Tao, Baturalp Buyukates, Duygu Nur Yaldiz, Yavuz Faruk Bakman*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.

These approaches can be combined with the proposed heavy-hitter token identification to dynamically adjust compression rates, thereby optimizing computational resources.\n\n## Heavy-Hitter Token Identification and H2RMSNorm\n\n- The heavy-hitter oracle mechanism proposed in \"H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\" by Zhang et al. (2023) aligns closely with the idea of heavy-hitter token identification. Integrating this with a novel normalization layer like H2RMSNorm, which adjusts normalization based on token significance, appears to be a novel and promising approach.\n\n## Latest Developments and Practical Implementations\n\n- To ensure the novelty of the proposal, it is essential to conduct targeted searches for very recent publications (late 2023 or early 2024) in major conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ACL, as well as arXiv preprints. This will help identify any recent works that might have proposed similar integrations.\n  \n- Searching for implementation studies, code repositories, or benchmarks that demonstrate practical applications of importance-weighted normalization and adaptive compression in transformers can provide valuable insights into the feasibility and potential challenges of the proposed model.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations and Practicality\n\n- Exploring theoretical analyses of importance-weighted normalization and heavy-hitter token identification will help ensure that the proposed methods are grounded in solid theoretical understanding.

    "proposal": "# H2-HierarchicalLinearTransformer: Efficient Hierarchical Processing with Heavy-Hitter Token Identification\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent autoregressive language models face significant challenges in efficiently processing long sequences while maintaining high performance. The seed design meta_hierarchical_linear_transfo introduces hierarchical multi-scale processing with linear attention, but can be enhanced through more efficient token selection and adaptive compression mechanisms.\n\nRecent advances in heavy-hitter token identification (H2O) and adaptive compression (AutoCompressors) suggest that significant improvements in efficiency are possible by focusing computational resources on the most important tokens. By integrating these approaches with hierarchical processing and enhancing the RMSNorm component, we can create a more efficient and scalable architecture.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n1. **Fixed Processing**: The current hierarchical approach processes all tokens similarly, regardless of their importance.\n2. **Inefficient Memory Usage**: Lack of adaptive compression leads to suboptimal memory utilization.\n3. **Static Normalization**: Standard RMSNorm doesn't account for token importance in normalization.\n\n### Opportunities for Enhancement\n\n1. **Token Importance**: Heavy-hitter token identification can guide processing priorities.\n2. **Adaptive Compression**: Dynamic compression rates based on token importance.\n3. **Hierarchical Processing**: Integration of importance-aware processing at different scales.\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nThe core idea is to enhance the hierarchical linear transformer by integrating heavy-hitter token identification and adaptive compression through a novel H2RMSNorm component. This approach:\n\n1. Identifies and prioritizes important tokens at each hierarchical level\n2. Dynamically adjusts compression rates based on token importance\n3. Modifies normalization behavior to account for token significance\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify: RMSNorm\n\nThe RMSNorm component is enhanced to create H2RMSNorm, which incorporates token importance awareness and adaptive compression.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Heavy-Hitter Score Computation**:\n   \\[\n   h(x_i) = \\sigma(W_h \\cdot x_i + b_h)\n   \\]\n   where \\(h(x_i)\\) is the importance score for token \\(i\\).\n\n2. **Adaptive Scaling Factor**:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha(x_i) = 1 + \\gamma \\cdot h(x_i)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\gamma\\) is a learnable parameter.\n\n3. **H2RMSNorm Computation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{H2RMSNorm}(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i \\cdot \\alpha(x_i))^2}} \\cdot g\n   \\]\n   where \\(g\\) is the learnable scale parameter.\n\n4. **Compression Rate Adjustment**:\n   \\[\n   c(x_i) = c_{\\text{base}} \\cdot (1 - \\beta \\cdot h(x_i))\n   \\]\n   where \\(c_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base compression rate and \\(\\beta\\) controls compression sensitivity.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n```python\nclass H2RMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim: int, eps: float = 1e-6):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(dim))\n        self.h_proj = nn.Linear(dim, 1)\n        self.gamma = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))\n        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))\n        \n    def compute_importance(self, x):\n        # Compute heavy-hitter scores\n        h_scores = torch.sigmoid(self.h_proj(x))\n        return h_scores\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Compute importance scores\n        h_scores = self.compute_importance(x)\n        \n        # Compute adaptive scaling factors\n        alpha = 1 + self.gamma * h_scores\n        \n        # Apply importance-weighted normalization\n        variance = torch.mean((x * alpha) ** 2, dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n        x_norm = x * torch.rsqrt(variance + self.eps)\n        \n        # Apply learnable scale\n        return self.weight * x_norm, h_scores\n```\n\n### Integration with Hierarchical Processing\n\n1. **Multi-scale Token Selection**:\n```python\nclass HierarchicalTokenSelector(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dims, num_levels):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.h2norms = nn.ModuleList([\n            H2RMSNorm(dims[i]) for i in range(num_levels)\n        ])\n        \n    def forward(self, x, level):\n        x_norm, scores = self.h2norms[level](x)\n        # Select tokens based on importance scores\n        mask = scores > self.compute_threshold(level)\n        return x_norm, mask\n```\n\n2. **Adaptive Compression**:\n```python\nclass AdaptiveCompressor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, base_rate):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.base_rate = base_rate\n        self.compress_proj = nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, scores):\n        # Adjust compression rate based on importance\n        rate = self.base_rate * (1 - self.beta * scores)\n        return self.compress_proj(x), rate\n```\n\n### Theoretical Analysis\n\n1. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to hierarchical processing\n   - Space Complexity: O(n) with adaptive compression\n   \n2. **Memory Efficiency**:\n   - Reduced memory usage through importance-based token selection\n   - Dynamic compression rates based on token significance\n\n3. **Information Flow**:\n   - Preserved important token information through adaptive scaling\n   - Hierarchical processing maintains multi-scale dependencies\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n```python\ndef init_h2norm(module):\n    if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):\n        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(module.weight)\n        if module.bias is not None:\n            nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)\n```\n\n2. **Training Considerations**:\n   - Gradual warmup of importance weighting\n   - Regularization of importance scores\n   - Monitoring of compression rates\n\n3. **Integration Steps**:\n   a. Replace standard RMSNorm with H2RMSNorm\n   b. Add token selection mechanisms at each level\n   c. Implement adaptive compression\n   d. Configure hierarchical processing\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe H2-HierarchicalLinearTransformer enhances the original design by:\n1. Introducing importance-aware normalization\n2. Enabling adaptive token selection and compression\n3. Maintaining hierarchical processing benefits\n4. Improving memory efficiency\n\nThese improvements result in a more efficient and scalable architecture while preserving or enhancing model performance.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Zhang, Z., et al.
